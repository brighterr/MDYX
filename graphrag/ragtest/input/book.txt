PREFACE
Advertising can cause you to stop and watch, or even stop and think. It can make you laugh,
or squirm in your seat, or bring tears to your eyes. It can inspire you to read about a new
product or remember a favorite brand when you’re walking down the aisle in a super-
market. Advertising can also leave you free to change the channel or turn a page without
being aware of having seen the brand message at all. So the question for you as a student
of marketing communication is: Did it work?
But you’re not the only one facing that question. It’s clear from the headlines in in-
dustry publications that marketers want to know if their ads and other marketing commu-
nication efforts work. Marketing communication, particularly advertising, costs money—a
lot of money in many cases—and marketers want proof that their advertising and market-
ing communication is efficient and effective.
That’s why this textbook, Advertising & IMC:Principles & Practice,is dedicated not
only to explaining advertising and other areas of brand communication—such as public re-
lations, direct marketing, and sales promotion—but also to investigating what makes mar-
keting communication effective.

WHAT’S NEW IN PRINCIPLES & PRACTICE,
NINTH EDITION
1. New emphasis on enduring principles in a changing industry
Keeping up with the dynamic world of advertising and marketing communication is a
challenge for any textbook. Recent developments facing the industry including the evolv-
ing world of digital media and the varied consumer responses to the Great Recession re-
mind us to think about principles that anchor our profession. Although we recognize that
the marketing communication environment is in an increasing state of upheaval, we also
believe that the basic principles of advertising and marketing communication are enduring
and will help the industry adjust to the changing marketplace. We call attention to these en-
during principles throughout Principles & Practiceas we describe how the practices are af-
fected by these new situations.
2. Increased IMC focus
To reflect a wider view of advertising among consumers and within the industry, we
have refocused the positioning of Principles & Practiceto add a more obvious discussion
of integrated marketing communication (IMC). The word advertising, in other words, has
come to refer to a variety of marketing communication tools and functions. From the very
first edition, Principles & Practicehas contained discussions about IMC, but in this edition
we have made that orientation clear. This broader focus includes all the various forms of
xix
xx PREFACE
marketing communication—multiplatform, as well as multimedia—and the discussion is
embedded seamlessly throughout the book.
3. Increased brand focus
We have introduced brand communication in previous editions, but with the more ex-
tensive use of IMC concepts in the Ninth Edition, we also have adjusted the language in
Principles & Practiceto focus on the point of the communication, which we see as a brand.
In other words, instead of talking about an advertisement as if it were an end in itself, we
now talk about brand communication. This recognizes that the ad, or any other marketing
communication message, has to be about something. And that something—the focus of all
these communication efforts—is the brand.
4. New set of IMC principles
For most of this book’s life, we have made an effort to identify key principles and draw
attention to them as call-outs in the margins. With the increased emphasis on IMC in the
Ninth Edition, we have also made an effort to develop a set of 10 key IMC-based princi-
ples for brand communication. They evolve within the chapters as various IMC concepts
are introduced and explained and come together as a set in a much revised Chapter 18, “The
IMC Umbrella.” This IMC wrap-up chapter explains IMC campaigns and distinguishes
campaigns from the management of a Total Communication program.
5. Language adjustment
To reflect this broader focus on brands and IMC, we also needed to adjust the language
throughoutPrinciples & Practice. In the Ninth Edition students will read about brand com-
munication, not just ads and advertisements. We still refer to ads, but only when we are talk-
ing specifically about that function. When we talk about the wider world of “advertising,”
we refer to marketing or brand communication.
6. Creative chapters moved ahead of media chapters
Creative thinking is a basic requirement in all areas of marketing communication. To
emphasize that and to respond to adopters and reviewers who prefer to teach creative be-
fore media, Part 3 now focuses on the creative side and message strategy; Part 4 focuses on
the media side.
7. Rewritten and reorganized media chapters reflecting changes in industry
In our first point on this list, we mentioned the changes in the media industry; which
include the growth of social media and the assault on traditional media. In recognition of
this new media environment, we have totally rewritten and reorganized the media chapters
inPrinciples & Practice. The first media chapter, which is now Chapter 11, is completely
new. It provides an overview of this new media world with a special emphasis on the ex-
citing new opportunities to engage with consumers. It also introduces the basic concepts
necessary to evaluate and compare media options. The second chapter is also completely
rewritten and now combines all the traditional media in one discussion. The third chapter
is more tightly focused on digital media; and the fourth chapter puts it all together in a dis-
cussion on media planning and buying including, of course, the new media.
8. New interactive and social media discussions
We note the special role that social media play in marketing communication strategies.
What has happened is a huge change in the way advertising, both in its traditional and wider
meanings, operate. It’s a paradigm shift with the entire industry moving from one-way tar-
geted media to two-way interactive media. The idea that the audience is in control not only
of what media they choose, but also what content they see (including messages generated
by other consumers), means companies have to engage, rather than target prospective cus-
tomers. And engagement means companies have to listen, as well as deliver messages. And
listening is much more complicated because it’s not just one customer calling a customer
service line, but rather sharing information online among family and thousands of “friends”
on social media, such as Facebook. Throughout Principles & Practice, the Ninth Edition
recognizes the impact and implications of this shift from company-controlled to consumer-
controlled media.
PREFACE xxi
9. New Principled Practice boxes
We’ve added a new feature called Principled Practice. In previous editions we in-
cluded ethics discussions in our Matter of PrincipleandMatter of Practiceboxes. In the
Ninth Edition we have designated a separate feature for these ethics boxes and titled it
Principled Practiceto help students think critically about current issues in the industry.
10. New pedagogical tools
• Anew award-winning American Advertising Federation National Student Advertising
Competition (AAF NSAC) case for the Century Council appears in the Appendix, and
questions referring to the case were added at the end of each chapter.
• BrandRevive is a new assignment at the end of each chapter that guides the student
through the activities involved in developing a brand campaign plan, in this case for
some older, perhaps forgotten brand that needs a new lease for space in the minds of con-
sumers. If students engage in this assignment continuously throughout the course, they
will develop a campaign plan for their portfolio.
• Anew MyLab website for Principles & Practicehas been created. Content from the text
has been moved to this site to provide more integration between the printed text and the
online support materials and activities.
WHY MARKETING COMMUNICATION?
We are using the phrase marketing communicationorbrand communicationbecause what
used to be known as advertisinghas expanded beyond the familiar ads in print media and
commercials on radio and television.
Electronic and social media have opened up new ways to communicate online with
consumers about a brand. Alternative and nontraditional forms, such as guerilla marketing
that reaches people in surprising ways in unexpected places, have opened up new opportu-
nities to engage people with brand messages through memorable experiences.
Creating buzz and dialogue have replaced the old
practice of targeting messages at consumers. Anew
The Facets Model of Effects
goal is to enlist word-of-mouth conversations to rein-
force and extend the power of the more traditional
marketing communication forms.
This wider view of advertisingincludes an array
of communication tools. We mentioned public rela-
tions, direct marketing, and sales promotion, but those
are just a few of the tools in the brand communication
toolkit. We will describe the use of these various see/hear feel
forms of brand communication as integrated market-
ing communication(IMC), which refers to the strate- Perception Emotion
gic use of multiple forms of communication to engage
different types of consumers who have an interest in
or connection to a brand.

returning home. Even the audience watching from their living rooms was inclined to join
in with applause as part of this graceful display of respect and appreciation. It was touch-
ing. Memorable. Beautifully photographed. And the people seemed real, not rehearsed. But
was it an effective ad? What was it trying to accomplish? Did the viewers remember it as
an Anheuser-Busch ad and, if so, did it affect their opinions of that company and its brands?
What is effective advertising? Is it marketing communication that gets talked about?
Is it a message like the Anheuser-Busch commercial that touches your emotions and in-
spires you to applaud? What, exactly, does it mean to say that an advertisement “works”?
Our answer is that brand communication is effective if it creates a desired response in
the audience. Abrand message that worksis advertising that affects people; it gets results
that can be measured. To better understand how this impact is created by a message, this
textbook will highlight the principles and best practices of the industry.
Principles & Practiceuses the Facets Model of Advertising Effectsto better explain
brand communication strategies, consumer responses, and effectiveness. The facets model
is like a diamond or a crystal whose surfaces represent the different types of responses gen-
erated by a brand message. This model and the ideas it represents are used throughout the
book to help explain such things as how objectives are decided on, what strategies deliver
what kind of effects, and how an advertisement and other forms of marketing communica-
tion are evaluated based on their objectives.
Principles & Practices
Marketing communication messages are part inspiration and part hard work, but they are
also a product of clear and logical thinking. Ultimately marketing communication is eval-
uated on its ability to generate a desired consumer response that meets a set of carefully
crafted objectives.
In most cases, consumers have little idea what the objectives are because that infor-
mation generally isn’t made public—and you sometimes can’t tell from the ad itself. But
think about the “Applause” ad. From what we’ve told you, what do you think the ad’s ob-

ontheplanes’tailsasafavoriteofconsumersintheDenvermarketandbeyond.
The economic downturn of 2008 and 2009, however, grounded much of Fron-
tier’s advertising as the airline was forced into bankruptcy because of a cash-flow
problem. Luckily, it emerged from the downturn with a new owner who recognized
the value of the brand and its award-winning advertising.
Frontier’s agency, Grey Worldwide, realized that Denverites were elated that
their hometown airline and its beloved animals would live to see another day. A
narrow window to celebrate this great news emerged. And once again, Creative
Directors Shawn Couzens and Gary Ennis turned to Larry, Jack, Flip, and the rest
of the gang for the perfect solution. The campaign had to be written and produced
quickly and affordably—so it could air while the news was still fresh. And so, in just
a few short weeks, the “Still the One” campaign was born.
This is just one example of how nimble the Frontier campaign is. No matter
what the message, or how quick the turnaround, the animals can always deliver it
in a way that’s engaging and relevant. In fact, the animals have proven so popular,
they may end up being the airline’s single most important asset when it comes to
the brand’s ultimate survival.
So how did it all start? In 2003, Grey Worldwide brought the tail animals to life
by creating a likable cast of characters—each different and unique in its own way.
The humorous ad campaign broke away from the buttoned-up approach used by
Campaigns: Company: Agency: Awards: most airlines by creating an “episodic sitcom” much like SeinfeldorCheers.As a
“Still the One,” Frontier Airlines Grey Worldwide Gold Effie (for sustained success), Silver result, consumers built an emotional attachment to the brand and its spokes-
“Flip to Mexico,” Clio, Silver Effie, Gold Mobius (“Best of animals. And with each new commercial, that connection grew stronger as Frontier
“Leather Seats” Show” Nomination) for “Flip to Mexico” continued to evolve the campaign.

7.Be flexible.My final important creative principle is
flexibility. Knowing when to be flexible has resulted
in some of the best work we’ve created here. While Ï
working on a body powder for summer that was to
be impregnated with water for a cooling sensation
on the skin, we ran into production problems. We
wanted a powder, but I decided to add flavor in-
stead. That edible body powder became a huge
subbrand for us, spawning multiple flavors and gen-
erating huge amounts of press and revenue. The
cooling powder would have been late, had quality
control issues, and probably would have lasted a
season.

seems to be a bit removed from a straight sales pitch.
An educated guess—and that’s what you will be better able to make after reading this
book—is that perhaps its objective is simply to make people feel good, to see the goodness
in a simple patriotic gesture—and, ultimately, to associate that feeling of goodness and
warmth with the brand. Does it work? How did you feel when you read over the descrip-
tion of the ad? Even without seeing the commercial, you may have found that the idea
touched your emotions and increased your respect or liking for the brand. To write objec-
tives, however, you must have some understanding of how these messages work.

In this Ninth Edition, we take you behind the scenes of many award-winning cam-
paigns, such as the “Aflac,” “Altoids,” and “Wii” campaigns, to uncover the hard work and
explain the objectives, the inspiration, and the creative ideas behind some great campaigns.
You will see how the ideas come together; you will live through the decision making; and
you will understand the risks the message creators faced.
We also have contributions from highly experienced professionals, as well as our Ad
Stars, graduates from advertising and marketing communication programs around the
country who were nominated by their professors to be featured in this book. We showcase
their work throughout the book. They also have written Inside Storiesthat explain strate-
gies and what they have learned on the job, as well as A Day in the Lifefeatures that pro-

The Proof
Advertisers and marketers want proof that their marketing communication is effective and
efficient. Likewise, you should want proof about the value of your textbooks. You will learn
in this book that all advertising claims need to be supported. That’s why we make the
claim—and, yes, this is an advertisement—that Advertising & IMC:Principles & Practice
is the book to read to learn about effective brand communication. We are making a bold
claim, but here is how we back it up.
xxiv PREFACE

as an important reference book as they move through their major. One thing we hear from
our young professional Ad Stars is that they continue to rely on this book as they make their
transition to professional life, and you can find it on many of their office shelves, as well.

ENDURING PRINCIPLES
IN TIMES OF TURMOIL
This is one of the most exciting times to take an advertising course because of all the changes in
the industry—new technology, new media, new types of consumers and media users, new ways
of looking at marketing communication, and new economic challenges. It’s also a great time to
be studying the basics of advertising because this is the era of back to basics.
From 2008 through 2010, the depressing economic scene, which was complicated by scary
shifts in media, played out like a really bad reality show. Analysts and experts worried about tra-
ditional business practices and called for new business models that would create turnarounds and
breakthroughs.
Unchanging Truths
in Times of Change
Rather than redefine the field to deal with the effects of the recession, Bill Weintraub, one of this
book’s Advisory Board members and a marketing expert who led marketing teams at Procter &
Gamble, Tropicana, Kellogg’s, and Coors, insists that the basic truths in marketing communica-
tion are immutable:
I don’t believe the underlying principles of marketing and communication should ever
change. Regardless of the economy, new media, changes in culture, etc. I don’t accept
that these superficial changes in the marketing environment are relevant in terms of
how intelligent business practices should be conducted.
So what are the immutable principles that guide the practice of marketing commu-
nication? Advisory Board member Regina Lewis, who has been in charge of consumer
insights for InterContinental Hotel Group and Dunkin’Brands, says:
I believe firmly that even—especially!—in a downturn, the basics of branding by con-
necting with consumer values lie at the heart of success. During tough economic times,
uniquely positioning your brand (a strategy based on knowing how consumers think
and feel about your brand versus competitive brands) is essential. And communicating
about your brand in a way that is highly meaningful to consumers becomes more im-
portant. This is my philosophy.

president of Global Consumer Insights for the InterContinental Hotel Group

Chapter 1 • The New World of Marketing Communication
Chapter 2 • Integrated Brand Communication
Chapter 3 • Brand Communication and Society
We agree with Weintraub and Lewis that branding, positioning, and communication are the
foundations of brand success. We’ve elaborated on their thoughts to compile seven principles that
we believe express marketing and marketing communication basics—even in economic down-
turns. These principles are central themes in this textbook:
1. BrandBuild and maintain distinctive brands that your customers love.
2. PositionIdentify your competitive advantage in the minds of consumers.
3. ConsumeFocus on consumers and match your brand’s strengths to consumer needs
and wants.
4. MessageIdentify your best prospects and engage them in a brand conversation.
5. MediaKnow how to best reach and connect with your target audience.
6. IntegrateKnow how to connect the dots and make everything in the marketing com-
munication toolkit work together.
7. EvaluateTrack everything you do so you know what works.
As you will see in this book, effective advertising and marketing communication are
founded on basic, enduring principles. The principles and practices described in this book pro-
vide direction even when the economy crashes. That doesn’t mean that brand communication is
unchanging. In fact, the practices are dynamic and continually adapting to changing marketplace
conditions. But the basic principles are unchanging even in times of change.
In the chapters that follow, these principles and practices will be explained, as will the key
practices of advertising and marketing communication. In Part 1, the first two chapters focus on
defining advertising and marketing and explaining where marketing communication fits. Chapter 3
analyzes the ethics and social responsibility of marketing and communication.

Ingredients for a Burger Freakout
Imagine the reaction store managers would receive if they announced to their
customers, “Today this Burger King is a Whopper-free zone.” No more Whop-
pers. That’s precisely what happened in a Las Vegas Burger King. The an-
nouncement was part of a social experiment designed to see how consumers
would react if they couldn’t get their beloved burgers. In the process it showed the
power of advertising to be relevant and effective in confirming that the Whopper
is “America’s favorite burger,” and it increased sales. Here’s the inside scoop.
Ad agency Crispin Porter (cid:2) Bogusky (CPB) faced this challenge: the Crispin
team had to “take a product that has been around for 50 years and sells more than
a billion units annually and make it interesting enough that the campaign would in-
crease sales during a highly competitive period.” And they had to do it using no
marketing tools other than advertising. Adding to the challenge, CPB had to ac-
complish this in a competitive environment: McDonald’s consistently outspends
Burger King three to one.
The solution: CPB knew that America loves the Whopper. The agency figured
it wasn’t enough to just announce that BK’s burger is the best. Who would care?
Instead of telling facts about the product, the agency figured it had to demonstrate
that it was the best burger in a compelling manner. Here’s your first advertising les-
son:To convince consumers, show them the truth about the product—don’t just
tell them about it—and do it memorably.
Just who eats Whoppers? Burger King knows its core demographic (its biggest
group of consumers) is 18- to24-year-old males, and it sure knows how to connect
with those dudes. Past promotional efforts included sponsorships with the Na-
tional Football League and NASCAR and tie-ins with The Simpsons Movie. Its
chicken sandwich was launched with the “Subservient Chicken” website. Who
could forget the creepy King mascot who shows up in weird places? The Whopper
commands a loyal and passionate following from those who love the weird—and
who aren’t counting calories.
To grab the attention of Whopper lovers, CPB came up with a big idea, a prank.
It devised an experiment that deprived consumers of their beloved Whopper—
something that hadn’t been done before in the burger war. To enact the deprivation

strategy, the agency took over a Burger King in Las Vegas for a single day and video-
taped with hidden cameras the reactions of consumers who were either told that
Whoppers had been permanently removed from the BK menu or given a competi-
tor’s burger such as a Big Mac or Wendy burger instead of a Whopper.

The Burger King “Whopper Freakout” campaign is an example of an award-winning effort that
proved how much America loves the Whopper. But what made it successful? In the Part 1opener
we made the point that, in spite of economic downturns, the basic principles remain important.
The Burger King story demonstrates the importance of a dramatic idea, as well as the power of
word of mouth. In this chapter we’ll define advertising and its role in marketing communication,
explain how its basic concepts and practices evolved, and describe the agency world. We’ll con-
clude by analyzing the changes facing marketing communication.
WHAT IS ADVERTISING?
You’ve seen thousands, maybe millions of commercial messages, so how would you define ad-
vertising, which is the most visible of all the forms of marketing communication that we will be
discussing in this book? It may sound silly to ask such an obvious question. But where would you
start if your instructor asked you for a definition of advertising?
At its most basic, the purpose of advertising has always been to sell a product,which can be
goods, services, or ideas. Although there have been major changes in recent years from dying
print media to merging and converging digital forms, the basics of advertising, as we said in the
Part 1opener, are even more important in turbulent times. To better understand advertising’s de-
velopment as a commercial form of communication, it helps to understand how advertising’s def-
inition and its basic roles have evolved over the years.
• IdentificationAdvertising identifies a product and/or the store where it’s sold. In its earliest
years, and this goes back as far as ancient times, advertising focused on identifying a prod-
uct and where it was sold. Some of the earliest ads were simply signs with the name or
graphic image of the type of store—cobbler, grocer, or blacksmith.
• InformationAdvertising provides information about a product. Advances in printing tech-
nology at the beginning of the Renaissance spurred literacy and brought an explosion of
printed materials in the form of posters, handbills, and newspapers. Literacy was no longer
the badge of the elite and it was possible to reach a general audience with more detailed in-
formation about products. The word advertisementfirst appeared around 1655, and by
1660 publishers were using the word as a heading in newspapers for commercial informa-
tion. These messages announced land for sale, runaways (slaves and servants), transporta-
tion (ships arriving, stagecoach schedules), and goods for sale from local merchants.
CHAPTER 1 • THE NEW WORLD OF MARKETING COMMUNICATION 7
Because of the importance of commercial information, these ads were
considered news and in many cases occupied more space in early news-
papers than the news stories.
• PersuasionAdvertising persuades people to buy things. The Industrial
Revolution accelerated social change, as well as mass production. It
brought the efficiency of machinery not only to the production of goods,
but also to their distribution. Efficient production plus wider distribution
meant that manufacturers could offer more products than their local
markets could consume. With the development of trains and national
roads, manufacturers could move their products around the country. For
widespread marketing of products, it became important to have a recog-
nizable brand name, such as Ivory or, more recently, Burger King. Also
large groups of people needed to know about these goods, so along with
industrial mechanization and the opening of the frontier came even more
use of new communication media, such as magazines, catalogs, and bill-
boards that reached more people with more enticing forms of persua-
sion. P. T. Barnum and patent medicine makers were among the
advertising pioneers who moved promotion from identification and in-
formation to a flamboyant version of persuasion called hype—graphics
and language characterized by exaggeration, or hyperbole.
Over the years, identification, information, and persuasion have been
the basic elements of marketing communication and the focus of adver-
tising. So how do we define it now realizing that advertising is dynamic
and constantly changing to meet the demands of society and the market-
place? We can summarize a modern view of advertising with the follow-
ing definition:
Advertising is a paid form of persuasive communication that uses
mass and interactive media to reach broad audiences in order to con-
nect an identified sponsor with buyers (a target audience), provide in-
formation about products (goods, services, and ideas), and interpret
the product features in terms of the customer’s needs and wants.

Advertising is usually paidfor by the advertiser (Burger King, for ex-
ample) who has a product to sell(the Whopper),although some forms of ad-
vertising, such as public service announcements (PSAs), use donated space
and time. Not only is the message paid for, but the sponsor is identified. Ad-
vertising began as one-waycommunication—from an advertiser to a targeted
audience. Digital media, however, have opened the door to interesting new
forms of two-way and multiple-way brand-related communication such as CLASSIC
word-of-mouth conversations among friends or consumer-generated mes- P. T. Barnum was a pioneer in advertising and

other roles they performed?
Advertising generally reaches a broad audienceofpotential customers,
either as a mass audience or in smaller targeted groups. However direct-
response advertising, particularly those practices that involve digital com-
munication, has the ability to address individual members of the audience.
So some advertising can deliver one-to-onecommunication but with a large
group of people.
In traditional advertising, the message is conveyed through different kinds
of mass media, which are largely nonpersonal messages. This nonpersonal
8 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL
characteristic, however, is changing with the introduction of more interactivetypes of media, as the
Whopper case demonstrates. Richard Edelman, CEO of the Edelman agency, emphasizes the emerg-
ing importance of word of mouth,which is personal communication through new media forms rather
than what he describes as “scripted messages in a paid format.”1
Most advertising has a defined strategy and seeks to inform consumers and/or make them
awareof a brand, company, or organization. In many cases, it also tries to persuadeor influence
consumers to do something, such as buy a product or check out a brand’s website. Persuasion may
involveemotionalmessages as well as information. In an unusual use of messages tied to feel-
ings, the Burger King “deprivation strategy” was designed to elicit negative responses to com-
petitors’burgers that were substituted for the Whopper.
Keep in mind that, as we have said, a product can be a good, service, or idea. Some non-
profits, for example, use ads to “sell” memberships, get volunteers and donations, or advocate
controversial positions.
Is Advertising the Only Tool in the Promotional Toolkit?
It’s not the only tool, although it may be the biggest. In the United States, advertising is a $30 bil-
lion industry.2Advertising often is seen as the driving force in marketing communication because
it commands the largest budget, as well as the largest number of agencies and professionals.

2008to2009basedonThirdQuarter(JanuarytoSeptember)figures.Whichcategoriesandad-
vertisers were on the increase and which decreased and what do you think accounts for those
changes?
As we said, advertising’s original purpose was to sell something, but over the years, other
promotional tools, with different sets of strengths, have developed to help meet that objective.
For example, providing information, particularly about some new feature or a new product, is
sometimes better handled through publicity or public relations. Direct-response advertising,
such as catalogs and flyers sent to the home or office, can also provide more information in
more depth than traditional ads that are limited in space and time. Specialtiesthat carry brand
logos as reminders or incentives to buy are handled by sales promotioncompanies. Communi-
cation with employees and shareholders about brands and campaigns is usually handled by
public relations.

Professionals see differences in all of these areas, but many people just see them all as

Why Advertising?
Advertising obviously plays a role in both communication and marketing as we’ve been discussing.
In addition to marketing communication, advertising also has a role in the functioning of the econ-
omy and society. Consider the launch of the Apple Macintosh in 1984, which was successful be-
cause of the impact of one advertisement, a television commercial generally considered to be the
greatest ever made. As you read about this “1984” commercial in the A Matter of Practice,note how
this commercial demonstrated all four functions—marketing, communication, social, and economic.
Marketing and Communication Roles In its marketing communication role, advertising trans-
forms a product into a distinctive brand by creating an imageand personality that goes beyond
straightforward product features. The “1984” commercial demonstrated how a personality could
be created for a computer (innovative), one that showcased it as a creative tool that breaks through
the rigid systems of other computer brands (IBM?). As advertising showcases brands, it also cre-
ates consumer demand (lines of customers the following day at stores where the Macintosh was
sold) and makes statements that reflect social issues and trends (opening up the new category of
personal computers for non-experts). So in addition to marketing and communication, advertis-
ing has economic and social roles.
Economic and Societal Roles Advertising flourishes in societies that enjoy economic abun-
dance, in which supply exceeds demand. In these societies, advertising extends beyond a prima-
rily informational role to create a demand for a particular brand. In the case of the “Whopper

Freakout” campaign, the decision was to make the product disappear in order to generate buzz,

CHAPTER 1 • THE NEW WORLD OF MARKETING COMMUNICATION 11
Two contrasting points of view explain how advertising creates economic impact. In the
first, the rational view, advertising is seen as a vehicle for helping consumers assess value through
price cues and other information, such as quality, location, and reputation. Advocates of this view-
point see the role of advertising as a means to objectively provide price/value information,
thereby creating more rational economic decisions. By focusing on images and emotional re-
sponses, the second approach appeals to consumers making a decision on nonprice, emotional
appeals. This emotional view explains how images and psychological appeals influence con-
sumer decisions. This type of advertising is believed to be so persuasive that it decreases the like-
lihood a consumer will switch to an alternative product, regardless of the price charged.
In addition to informing us about new and improved products, advertising also mirrors fash-
ion and design trends and adds to our aesthetic sense. Advertising has an educational role in that
it teaches about new products and their use. It may also expose social issues—some say the
“1984” commercial symbolically proclaimed the value of computer literacy “for the rest of us,”
those who weren’t slaves to the hard-to-operate PC systems of the time. It helps us shape an im-
age of ourselves by setting up role models with which we can identify (a woman athlete liberat-
ing the gray masses), and it gives us a way to express ourselves in terms of our personalities
(smash the screen image of Big Brother) and sense of style (red shorts—the only color in the drab
environment) through the things we wear and use. It also presents images capturing the diversity
of the world in which we live. These social roles have both negative and positive dimensions,
which we will discuss in Chapter 3.
What Are the Most Common Types of Advertising?
There isn’t just one kind of advertising. In fact, advertising is a large and varied industry. Differ-
ent types of advertising have different roles. Considering all the different advertising situations,
we can identify seven major types of advertising:
1. Brandadvertising,themostvisibletypeofadvertising,isreferredtoasnationalor
consumeradvertising.Brandadvertising,suchasthatfortheAppleMacintoshintheclassic

atingadistinctiveimagefortheretailer.Localadvertisingcanrefertoaretailer,suchas

graphicarea.
3. Direct-response advertisingtries to stimulate an immediate response by the customer to
the seller. It can use any advertising medium, particularly direct mail and the Internet. The
consumer can respond by telephone, mail, or over the Internet, and the product is delivered
directly to the consumer by mail or some other carrier.
4. Business-to-business (B2B) advertising,also called trade advertising,is sent from one
business to another. It includes messages directed at companies distributing products as
well as industrial purchasers and professionals such as lawyers and physicians. Advertisers
place most business advertising in professional publications.
5. Institutional advertising,also called corporate advertising,focuses on establishing a cor-
porate identity or winning the public over to the organization’s point of view. Tobacco
companies, for example, run ads that focus on the positive things they are doing. The ads
for a pharmaceutical company showcasing leukemia treatment also adopt that focus.
6. Nonprofit advertisingis used by not-for-profit organizations, such as charities, founda-
tions, associations, hospitals, orchestras, museums, and religious institutions, to reach cus-
tomers (hospitals, for example), members (the Sierra Club), and volunteers (Red Cross). It
is also used to solicit donations and other forms of program participation. The “Truth”®
campaign for the American Legacy Foundation, which tries to reach teenagers with anti-
smoking messages, is an example of nonprofit advertising.
7. Public service advertisingprovides messages on behalf of a good cause, such as stopping
drunk driving (as in ads from Mothers Against Drunk Driving) or preventing child abuse. Also
calledpublic service announcements (PSAs),advertising and public relations professionals
usually create them pro bono(free of charge) and the media donate the space and time.

specific market, such as this direct-mail piece for T. J. Maxx.

Although these categories identify characteristics of various types of advertising, there are
many commonalities. In practice, all types of advertising demand creative, original messages that
are strategically sound and well executed, and all of them are delivered through some form of me-
dia. Furthermore, advertisements can be developed as single ads largely unrelated to other ads by
the same advertiser or as a campaign,a term that refers to a set of related ads that are variations

on a theme. They are used in different media at different
times for different segments of the audience and to keep
attracting the attention of the target audience. Let’s now
consider the development of key advertising concepts and
practices.
HOW DID CURRENT PRACTICES
AND CONCEPTS DEVELOP?
As illustrated in the timeline in Figure 1.1the advertising
industry is dynamic and is affected by changes in technol-
ogy, media, and the economic and social environment. But
this history is far more than names and dates. The timeline
reflects how the principles and practices of a multibillion-
dollar industry have evolved.3
Eras and Ages
The timeline divides the evolution of advertising into five
stages, which reflect historical eras and the changes that
lead to different philosophies and styles of advertising. As
you read through this, note how changing environments, in
particular media advancements, have changed the way ad-
vertising functions. (For more historical information check

this age was print,particularly newspapers, although handbills and posters were also important,
as well as hand-painted signs. The first newspaper ad appeared in 1704 for Long Island real
estate, and Benjamin Franklin’s Pennsylvania Gazette ran the first advertising section in 1729.
The first magazineads appeared in 1742 in Franklin’s General Magazine.
The Early Age of Agencies The 19th century brought the beginning of what we now recognize
as the advertising industry. Volney Palmer opens the first ad agencyin 1848 in Philadelphia. The
J. Walter Thompson agency is formed in 1864, the oldest advertising agency still in existence.
P.T. Barnum brings a Swedish singer to the United States and uses a blitz of newspaper ads, hand-
bills, and posters, one of the first campaigns. In 1868 the N.W. Ayer agency begins the
commission system for placing ads—advertising professionals initially were agents or brokers
who bought space and time on behalf of the client for which they received a commission, a per-
centage of the media bill. The J. Walter Thompson agency invents the account executiveposition,
a person who acts as a liaison between the client and the agency.
As advertisers and marketers became more concerned about creating ads that worked, pro-
fessionalism in advertising began to take shape. Here, also, is when it became important to have
a definition or a theory of advertising. In the 1880s, advertising was referred to by advertising
legend Albert Lasker as “salesmanship in printdriven by a reason why.”Those two phrases be-
came the model for stating an ad claimand explaining the supportbehind it.
On the retail side, department store owner John Wanamaker hired John E. Powers in 1880
as the store’s full-time copywriterand Powers crafted an advertising strategy of “ads as news.”
The McCann agency, which began in 1902, also developed an agency philosophy stated as “truth
well told”that emphasized the agency’s role in crafting the ad message. Printer’s Ink,the adver-
tising industry’s first trade publication, appeared in 1888. In the early 1900s, the J. Walter Thompson

piled media data as an industry reference.
By the end of the 19th century advertisers began to give their goods brand names, such as
Baker’s Chocolate and Ivory Soap. The purpose of advertising during this period was to create
demand, as well as a visual identity, for these new brands. Inexpensive brand-named products,
known as packed goods, began to fill the shelves of grocers and drug stores. The questionable
ethics of hype and puffery,which is exaggerated promises, came to a head in 1892 when Ladies
Home Journal banned patent medicine advertising. But another aspect of hype was the use of
powerful graphics that dramatized the sales message.
In Europe, the visual quality of advertising improved dramatically as artists who were also
illustrators, such as Toulouse-Lautrec, Aubrey Beardsley, and Alphonse Mucha, brought their
craftsmanship to posters and print ads, as well as magazine illustrations. Because of the artistry,
this period is known as the Golden Age.The artist role moved beyond illustration to become the
art directorin 20th-century advertising.

In the early 20th-century, modern professional advertising adopted scientific researchtech-

Two leaders were Claude Hopkins and John Caples. At the height of Hopkins’career, he was Lord
& Thomas’s best-known copywriter. Highly analytical, he conducted tests of his copyto refine
his advertising methods, an approach explained in his 1923 book, Scientific Advertising. John
Caples, vice president of Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn (BBDO), published Tested Adver-
tising Methodsin 1932. His theories about the pullingpower of headlinesalso were based on ex-
tensive tests. Caples was known for changing the style of advertising writing, which had been

wordy and full of exaggerations. During the 1930s and 1940s, Daniel Starch, A. C. Nielsen, and
George Gallup founded research organizations that are still part of today’s advertising industry.
During and after the Great Depression, Raymond Rubicam emerged as an advertising power
and launched his own agency with John Orr Young, a Lord & Thomas copywriter under the name
of Young and Rubicam. Their work was known for intriguing headlines and fresh, original ap-
proaches to advertising ideas.
Targeting,the idea that messages should be directed at particular groups of prospective buy-
ers, evolved as media became more complex. Advertisers realized that they could spend their
budgets more efficiently by identifying those most likely to purchase a product, as well as the best
ways to reach them. The scientific era helped media better identify their audiences. In 1914 the
Audit Bureau of Circulation (ABC) was formed to standardize the definition of paid circulation
for magazines and newspapers. Media changes saw print being challenged by radio advertising
in 1922. Radio surpassed print in ad revenue in 1938.

Television commercials came on the scene in the early 1950s and brought a huge new rev-
enue stream to the advertising industry. In 1952 the Nielsen rating system for TVadvertising be-
came the primary way to measure the reach of TV commercials.
This period also saw marketing practices, such as product differentiation and market seg-
mentation incorporated into advertising strategy. The idea of positioning, carving out a unique
spot in people’s minds for the brand, was developed by Al Ries and Jack Trout in 1969.
The Creative Revolution The creative power of agencies exploded in the 1960s and 1970s,
a period marked by the resurgence of art, inspiration, and intuition. Largely in reaction to the

Who can forget Pepsi's use of celebrity Due to the 9/11 attacks,

social responsiblilty focus.
FIGURE
1.1 (continued) emphasis on research and science, this revolution was inspired by three creative geniuses: Leo
Burnett, David Ogilvy, and William Bernbach.
Leo Burnett was the leader of what came to be known as the Chicago school of advertising.
He believed in finding the “inherent drama”in every product. He also believed in using cultural
archetypes to create mythical characters who represented American values, such as the Jolly
Green Giant, Tony the Tiger, the Pillsbury Doughboy, and his most famous campaign character,
the Marlboro Man (www.leoburnett.com).
Ogilvy, founder of the Ogilvy & Mather agency, is in some ways a paradox because he mar-
ried both the image schoolof Rubicam and the claim schoolof Lasker and Hopkins. He created
enduring brands with symbols,such as the Hathaway Man and his mysterious eye patch for the
Hathaway shirt maker, and handled such quality products as Rolls-Royce, Pepperidge Farm, and
Guinness with product-specific and information-rich claims (www.ogilvy.com).
The Doyle, Dane, and Bernbach (DDB) agency opened in 1949. From the beginning,
William Bernbach—with his acute sense of words, design, and creative concepts—was consid-
ered to be the most innovative advertising creative person of his time. His advertising touched
people—and persuaded them—by focusing on feelings and emotions.He explained, “There are
a lot of great technicians in advertising. However, they forget that advertising is persuasion, and
persuasion is not a science, but an art. Advertising is the art of persuasion.”4Bernbach is known
for the understated Volkswagen campaign that ran at a time when car ads were full of glamour
and bombast. The campaign used headlines such as “Think Small” with accompanying picture of
a small VWbug (www.ddb.com).
The Era of Accountability and Integration Starting in the 1970s, the industry-wide focus was
oneffectiveness. Clients wanted ads that produced sales, so the emphasis was on research, test-
ing, and measurement. To be accountable, advertising and other marketing communication agencies
recognized that their work had to prove its value. After the dot.com boom and economic down-
turn in the 1980s and 1990s, this emphasis on accountability became even more important, and
advertisers demanded proof that their advertising was truly effective in accomplishing its
objectivesas stated in the strategy.
Social responsibilityis another aspect of accountability. Although advertising regulation has

SHOWCASE
The pro bono Handgun Control campaign was designed as a wake-up call following the Columbine High School shootings.
Chris Hutchinson, art director at Weiden (cid:2)Kennedy, explained that “Children killing children with guns is a very real
issue and we wanted to communicate the horror of this. The visuals are meant to shock juxtaposing toys
with gun violence.”

vertising Review Board was created to monitor questions of taste and social responsibility.
Charges of using sweatshops in low-wage countries and an apparent disregard for the environ-
ment concerned critics such as Naomi Klein, who wrote the best-selling book No Logoand Marc

inform youth about the dangers of smoking without preaching to them.
As the digital era brought nearly instantaneous means of communication, spreading word of
mouthamong a social network of consumers, companies became even more concerned about their
practices and reputation.The recession that began in December 2007 and subsequent headlines about
bad business practices, such as the Bernard Madoff “Ponzi” scheme, made consumers even more con-
cerned about business ethics.
We also characterize this as the era when integrated marketing communication became
important. Integrated marketing communication (IMC) is another technique that

So What Are the Key Components of Advertising?
In this brief review of how advertising developed over some 300 years, a number of Effectiveness
key concepts were introduced all of which will be discussed in more detail in the chap-
ters that follow. But let’s summarize these concepts in terms of a simple set of key
components that describe the practice of advertising: strategy, message, media, and Message Evaluation

reputation, as well as the position and differentiation of the product from the competition,
and segmenting and targeting the best prospects.
• MessageThe concept behind a message and how that message is expressed is based on research and
consumer insights with an emphasis on creativity and artistry.
• MediaVarious media have been used by advertisers over the centuries including print (hand-
bills, newspapers, magazines), outdoor (signs and posters), broadcast (radio and television),
and now digital media. Targeting ads to prospective buyers is done by matching their profiles
to media audiences. Advertising agency compensation was originally based on the cost of
buying time or space in the media.
• EvaluationEffectiveness means meeting objectives and in order to determine if that has hap-
pened, there must be testing. Standards also are set by professional organizations and companies
that rate the size and makeup of media audiences, as well as advertising’s social responsibility.
This section briefly identified how various jobs and professional concepts emerged over
time. Let’s now put the agency world under a microscope and look deeper at the structure of the
industry.
THE AGENCY WORLD
In the discussion of definitions and the evolution of advertising practices, we briefly introduced
agencies, but as a student of advertising and marketing communication you need to know more
about how agencies are organized and how they operate.
Who Are the Key Players?
As we discuss the organization of the industry, consider that all the key players also represent job
opportunities you might want to consider if you are interested in working in advertising or some
area of marketing communication. The players include the advertiser (referred to by the agency
as the client) who sponsors the message, the agency, the media, and the supplierswho provide
expertise. The A Matter of Practicebox about the greatest television commercial ever made in-
troduced a number of these key players and illustrated how they all make different contributions
to the final advertising.
The Advertiser Advertising begins with the advertiser,which is the company that sponsors the
advertising about its business. In the “1984” story, Apple Computer was the advertiser, and Steve
Jobs, the company’s CEO, made the final decision to run the then-controversial commercial. The
advertiser is the number one key player. Management of this function usually lies with the mar-
keting department but in smaller companies, such as Urban Decay Cosmetics, the advertising de-
cisions may lie with the owner, founder, or partners in the business. Wende Zomnir is not only a
founding partner of Urban Decay Cosmetics, she is also an advertising graduate and a marketing
communication professional.
Most advertisers have a marketing team that initiates the advertising effort by identifying a
marketing problem advertising can solve. For example, Apple executives knew that the Macintosh
easy-to-use computer platform needed to be explained and that information about the launch of
the new computer would need to reach a large population of potential computer buyers. Adver-
tising was essential to the success of this new product.
The marketing executive (with input from the corporate officers and others on the marketing
team) also hires the advertising agency—for Burger King this was Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky—and
other marketing communication agencies as needed. In professional jargon, the advertiser (Burger
King) becomes the agency’s client. As the client, the advertiser is responsible for monitoring the
work and paying the agency for its work on the account. That use of the word accountis the reason
agency people refer to the advertiser as theaccountand the agency person in charge of that adver-
tiser’s business as the account manager.
The marketing team makes the final decisions about strategy including the target audience
and the size of the advertising budget. This team approves the advertising or marketing commu-
nication plan, which contains details outlining the message and media strategies. In Chapter 2
we’ll explain more about how this marketing team functions.

wanted a powder, but I decided to add flavor instead.
That edible body powder became a huge subbrand
for us, spawning multiple flavors and generating huge
amounts of press and revenue. The cooling powder
would have been late, had quality control issues, and
probably would have lasted a season.

Big companies may have hundreds of agencies working for them, although they normally
have an agency-of-record (AOR)that does most of their business and may even manage or co-
ordinate the work of other agencies.
The Agency The second player is the advertising agency (or other types of marketing com-
munication agencies) that creates, produces, and distributes the messages. The working arrange-
ment between advertiser and agency is known as the agency–client partnership.Both the “1984”
story and the BK deprivation scheme demonstrated how important it is to cultivate a strong sense
of trust between the agency and its clients because these were both risky ideas.
An advertiser uses an outside agency because it believes the agency will be more efficient in
creating advertising messages than the advertiser would be on its own. Successful agencies such
as Crispin Porter (cid:2) Bogusky typically have strategic and creative expertise, media knowledge,
workforce talent, and the ability to negotiate good deals for clients. The advertising professionals
working for the agency are experts in their areas of specialization and passionate about their work.
Not all advertising professionals work in agencies. Large advertisers, either companies or
organizations, manage the advertising process either by setting up an advertising department
(sometimes called marketing services) that oversees the work of agencies or by setting up their
own in-house agency, as we see in Figure 1.3. Tasks performed by the company’s marketing ser-
vices department include the following: select the agencies; coordinate activities with vendors,
such as media, production, and photography; make sure the work gets done as scheduled; and de-
termine whether the work has achieved prescribed objectives.
The Media The third player in the advertising world is the media. The emergence of mass me-
dia has been a central factor in the development of advertising because mass media offers a way
to reach a widespread audience. In traditional advertising, the term mediarefers to all of the chan-
nels of communication that carry the message from the advertiser to the audience and from con-
sumers back to companies. We refer to these media as channelsbecause they deliver messages,
but they are also companies, such as your local newspaper or radio station.
Some of these media conglomerates are huge, such as Time Warner and Viacom. Time
Warner, for example, is a $40 billion company with some 38,000 employees. It owns HBO, Time
Inc., Turner Broadcasting, and Warner Brothers, among other media companies. You can learn
more about this media conglomerate at www.timewarner.com. Media vehicles are the specific
programs, such as 60 MinutesorThe Simpsons,or magazines—The New York Times,Advertising
Age,Woman’s Day.
Note that mediais plural when it refers to various channels, but singular—medium—when
it refers to only one form, such as newspapers.
Each medium (newspaper, radio or TVstation, billboard company, etc.) has a department that
is responsible for selling ad space or time. These departments specialize in assisting advertisers in

comparing the effectiveness of various media as they try to select the best mix of media to use.
Many media organizations will assist advertisers in the design and production of advertisements.
That’s particularly true for local advertisers using local media, such as a retailer preparing an ad-
vertisement for the local newspaper.
The primary advantage of advertising’s use of mass mediais that the costs to buy time in

than 100 million people, the cost is not so extreme. One of the big advantages of mass-media ad- numbers of prospective
vertising is that it can reach a lot of people with a single message in a very cost-efficient form. consumers.
Professional Suppliers and Consultants The fourth player in the world of advertising include
artists, writers, photographers, directors, producers, printers, and self-employed freelancers and
consultants. In the “1984” story, the movie director Ridley Scott was a supplier in that Chiat/Day
contracted with him to produce the commercial. This array of suppliers mirrors the variety of
tasks required to put together an ad. Other examples include freelance copywriters and graphic
artists, songwriters, printers, market researchers, direct-mail production houses, telemarketers,
and public relations consultants. Why would the other advertising players hire an outside sup-
plier? There are many reasons. The advertiser or the agency may not have expertise in a special-
ized area, their people may be overloaded with work, or they may want a fresh perspective. They
also may not want to incur the overhead of full-time employees.
Types of Agencies
We are primarily concerned with advertising agencies in this chapter, but other areas such as pub-
lic relations, direct marketing, sales promotion, and the Internet have agencies that provide spe-
cialized promotional help, as well.
The A-List awards by Advertising Agerecognize cutting-edge agencies that rank high in three
areas: First they are creative—Ad Agecalls them “widely imaginative”—in developing brand strate-
gies and executions. Second, they are fast growing and winners of some of the biggest new business
pitches. Finally, they are recognized for their effectiveness. In other words, their work leads to mea-
surable results. Note that the agencies in the following list represent big and small agencies, as well
as full-service and specialized agencies. At the top of the list is the agency of the year, Crispin
Porter(cid:2)Bogusky, the agency behind the Burger King “Whopper Freakout” campaign.
A-List of Advertising Agencies
1. Crispin Porter (cid:2)BoguskyThis agency used to be a medium-size, independent Miami
hotshop, but now it’s a big national creative power from Miami and Boulder, Colorado,
known for its provocative work for Burger King, Old Navy, and Coke Zero, among other
powerhouse clients (www.cpbgroup.com).
2. TBWA/Chiat/DayThis L.A.-based agency creates what it calls its “disruptive ideas” for
global clients such as Visa and Adidas. This is the agency behind the legendary “1984” ad
for Apple’s Macintosh (www.tbwa.com).
Advertising relies on the expertise of many different people, such as television producers,
graphic designers, photographers, printers, and musicians.

In addition to agencies that specialize in advertising and other areas of marketing commu-
nication, there are also consulting firms in marketing research and branding that offer specialized
services to other agencies, as well as advertisers. Since these various types of marketing com-
munication areas are all part of an integrated marketing communication approach, we cover many
of these functions in separate chapters later in the book.
Full-Service Agencies In advertising, a full-service agencyincludes the four major staff func-
tions of account management, creative services, media planning, and account planning, which in-
cludes research. A full-service advertising agency also has its own finance and accounting
department, a traffic department to handle internal tracking on completion of projects, a de-
partment for broadcast and print production (sometimes organized within the creative depart-
ment), and a human resources department.

In-House Agencies Like a regular advertising agency, an in-house agency produces ads and
places them in the media, but the agency is a part of the advertiser’s organization, rather than
an outside company. Companies that need closer control over their advertising have their own
CHAPTER 1 • THE NEW WORLD OF MARKETING COMMUNICATION 23
internal in-house agencies. An in-house agency performs most, and sometimes all, of the func-
tions of an outside advertising agency and produce materials, such as point-of-sale displays, sales
team literature, localized ads and promotions, and coupon books, that larger agencies have a hard
time producing cost effectively. Retailers, for example, find that doing their own advertising and
media placement provides cost savings, as well as the ability to meet fast-breaking deadlines.
Some fashion companies, such as Ralph Lauren, also create their own advertising in house to
maintain complete control over the brand image and the fashion statement it makes. Check out
this in-house agency at http://about.ralphlauren.com/campaigns/default.asp.
Specialized Agencies Many agencies do not follow the traditional full-service agency approach.
They either specialize in certain functions (writing copy, producing art, or media buying), audi-
ences (minority, youth), industries (health care, computers, agriculture, business-to-business
communication), or markets (minority groups such as Asian, African American, or Hispanic). In
addition, some agencies specialize in other marketing communication areas, such as branding, di-
rect marketing, sales promotion, public relations, events and sports marketing, packaging, and
point-of-sale promotions. Sometimes one-client agencies are created to handle the work of one
large client. Let’s take a look at two special types of agencies:
• Creative boutiquesare ad agencies, usually small (two or three people to a dozen or more),
that concentrate entirely on preparing the creative execution of the idea, or the creative prod-
uct. Acreative boutique has one or more writers or artists on staff, but generally no staff for
media, research, or strategic planning. Typically, these agencies can prepare advertising to
run in print and broadcast media, as well as in out-of-home (such as outdoor and transit ad-
vertising), Internet, and alternative media. Creative boutiques usually serve companies di-
rectly, but are sometimes retained by full-service agencies that are overloaded with work.
• Media-buying servicesspecialize in the purchase of media for clients. They are in high de-
mand for many reasons, but three reasons stand out. First, media has become more complex
as the number of choices has grown—think of the proliferation of new cable channels, mag-
azines, and radio stations. Second, the cost of maintaining a competent media department
has escalated. Third, media-buying services often buy media at a low cost because they can
group several clients’purchases together to get discounts from the media because of the vol-
ume of their media buys.
Agency Networks and Holding Companies Finally let’s talk about agency networks,which are
large conglomerations of agencies under a central ownership. Agency networks are all of the of-
fices that operate under one agency name, such as DDB Worldwide (200 offices in 90 countries)
or BBDO Worldwide (287 offices in 79 countries). You can read more about these agencies and
their networks at www.ddb.comandwww.bbdoworldwide.com.
Holding companiesinclude one or more advertising agency networks, as well as other types
of marketing communication agencies and marketing services consulting firms. The four largest
are WPPGroup, Interpublic, Omnicom, and Publicis. WPP, for example, includes the J. Walter
Thompson Group, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, Young & Rubicam, Grey Global Group, and
Bates advertising networks, as well as the Berlin Cameron creative agency, public relations agen-
cies Hill and Knowlton, Ogilvy Public Relations, and Burson-Marsteller; direct-response com-
pany Wunderman; research firms Millward Brown and Research International; media firms
Mindshare and Mediaedge:cia; and branding and corporate identity firms Landor and Lambie-
Naim, to name a few. Most of those firms are also networks with multiple offices. For an inside
look at a big holding company, check out WPPat www.wpp.com.
How Are Agency Jobs Organized?
In addition to the chief executive officer, if the agency is large enough, it usually has one or more
vice presidents, as well as department heads for the different functional areas. We will concen-
trate on five of those areas: account management; account planning and research; creative devel-
opment and production; media research, planning, and buying; and internal services.

Once the client and agency together establish the general guidelines for a campaign, the ac-
count management team supervises the day-to-day development. Account management in a ma-
jor agency typically has three levels: the management supervisor, who provides leadership on
strategic issues and looks for new business opportunities; the account supervisor,who is the key
executive working on a client’s business and the primary liaison between the client and the

agency; and the account executive(as well as assistant account executives), who is responsible
for day-to-day activities and operates like a project manager. Asmaller agency will combine some
of these levels. Of course, individual agencies also have their own titles for these positions, such
as the “content manager” title used at CPB.
Account Planning and Research Full-service agencies usually have a separate department
specifically devoted to planning and sometimes to research as well. Today the emphasis in agency
research is on developing an advertising message concept that focuses on the consumer’s per-
spective and relationship with the brand. The account planninggroup gathers all available in-
telligence on the market and consumers and acts as the voice of the consumer. Account planners
are strategic specialists who prepare comprehensive information about consumers’wants, needs,
and relationship to the client’s brand and recommendations on how the advertising should work
to satisfy those elements based on insights they derive from consumer research.
Creative Development and Production A creative group includes people who write
(copywriters), people who design ideas for print ads or television commercials (art directors), and
people who convert these ideas into television or radio commercials (producers). Many agencies
build a support group around a team of an art director and copywriter who work well together. In
addition to these positions, the broadcast production department and art studio are two other ar-
eas where creative personnel can apply their skills.
Media Research, Planning, and Buying Agencies that don’t rely on outside media specialists
have a media department that recommends to the client the most efficient means of delivering
the message to the target audience. That department has three functions: research, planning, and
buying. Because the media world is so complex, it is not unusual for some individuals to become
experts in certain markets or types of media.
Internal Operations The departments that serve the operations within the agency include the
traffic department and print production, as well as the more general financial services and human
resources (personnel) departments. The traffic department is the lifeblood of the agency, and its
personnel keep track of everything that happens.
How Are Agencies Paid?
Advertising agencies are a big business. Procter & Gamble, for example, spends nearly $5 billion
annually on global advertising. With that kind of money on the table, you can imagine that the
agency–client relationship is under pressure from both sides. Agencies want to get more work and
get paid more; clients want to cut costs and make their advertising as cost effective as possible.
Agencies derive their revenues and profits from three main sources: commissions, fees,and
retainers. For years, a 15 percent commissionon media billings was the traditional form of com-
pensation. That’s actually how agencies got started back in the 19th century. For those few ac-
counts still using a commission approach, the rate is rarely 15 percent; it is more likely lower and
subject to negotiation between agency and client.
Many advertisers now use a fee system either as the primary compensation tool or in com-
bination with a commission system. The fee system is comparable to the system by which ad-
vertisers pay their lawyers and accountants. The client and agency agree on an hourly fee or rate
or may negotiate a charge for a specific project. This fee can vary by department, or it may be a
flat hourly fee for all work regardless of the salary level of the person doing the work. Charges
are also included for out-of-pocket expenses, travel, and other standard items.
An agency also may be put on a monthly or yearly retainer.The amount billed per month is
based on the projected amount of work and the hourly rate charged. This system is most com-
monly used by public relations agencies.
Amore recent trend in agency compensation is for advertisers to pay agencies on the basis of
their performance. One consultant recommends that this arrangement be based on paying the agency
either a percentage of the client’s sales or a percentage of the client’s marketing budget. Procter &
Gamble is a pioneer in trying to apply this system. Another version of this idea is that agencies share
in the profits of their client when they create a successful campaign, but that also means they have
a greater financial risk in the relationship should the advertising not create the intended impact.
Another innovation in agency compensation is called value billing, which means that the
agency is paid for its creative and strategic ideas, rather than for executions and media placements.
26 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL
Sarah Armstrong, Coke’s director of worldwide media and communication, has urged the indus-
try to shift to “value-based” forms of compensation that reward agencies based on effectiveness—
whether they make the objectives they set for their advertising.6
HOW IS THE PRACTICE OF ADVERTISING CHANGING?

Consumer in Charge
As Jim Stengel, Procter & Gamble’s former global marketing officer, has said, “[I]t’s not just
about doing great TVcommercials: The days of pounding people with images, and shoving them
down their eyeballs are over. The consumer is much more in control now.”7This change is caus-
ing some shifts in the way the advertising business operates.
In 2009 CareerBuilder dismissed one of the most creative agencies—Portland-based Wieden (cid:2)
Kennedy, who had created five great Super Bowl ads for the job-posting website—and took its ad-
vertising in house. The reason is that the company wants ordinary consumers to create 25-second com-
mercials for the brand. That will not only bring publicity, but also save bucks. CareerBuilder, through
its in-house agency, will still pay for production of the winning ad and buy the ad time. Not only will
this move bring more opportunities for consumer-generated advertising(at the expense of advertising
agencies), the company estimates it will save around 15 to 20 percent of its annual marketing costs.8
Other brands that have used consumer-generated ads include Frito-Lay, Converse, Master-
Card, and L’Oreal. Frito-Lay received thousands of media mentions for its Super Bowl ad con-
test on such programs as The Tonight Show,The View,andGood Morning America. You can check
out Doritos’collection of consumer-generated Super Bowl ads in the “Crash the Super Bowl”
contest at www.crashthesuperbowl.com/#/winners.
Consumer involvement in advertising is a bigger issue than just ad agencies losing their
clients. In fact, consumers have been taking control of media and marketing for a number of
years through Wikipedia, Twitter, and other newly democratized information sources. YouTube,
MySpace, and Facebook have invited everyone into the ad distribution game. The Internet is a
new world of interaction and consumer-initiated contacts that are creating entirely new ways of
communicating with potential customers. That’s why in 2006, Timemagazine spotted the trend
and named “You the Consumer” as its Person of the Year and then in 2007 Advertising Agenamed
the consumer its “Agency of the Year.”
Blurring Lines and Converging Media
One of the biggest changes impacting the advertising industry is the changing media environ-
ment. Television used to be the big gun, and it still eats up the biggest part of the budget, but the
old networks (CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX) are only half as important as they used to be as the num-
ber of cable channels has exploded.
The big bomb that has fragmented the media world is digital media, which appear in so many
different forms that it’s impossible to keep up with them. The newspaper industry has been par-
ticularly hurt as it has realized that much, if not most, of its content can be accessed more easily
and quickly in a digital format. So are newspapers dead?
Traditional media are trying to adjust by transforming themselves into new digital formats,
as well. So what do you call online versions of newspapers and magazines? Are they still print
when they appear on a screen? And new personal media—iPhones, iPods, iPads, BlackBerries,
Kindles—are real shape-changers. They can be phones, music players, calendars, and sources of
local and national information, as well as cameras, video viewers, book readers, Web surfers, and
video game players. Changes such as these need to be considered when putting together media
plans, a challenge that will be discussed in Part 3.
Advertising agencies make most of their money from television spots and print media. How-
ever, as we’ve mentioned, both of those revenue streams are threatened by economics and the chang-
ing media landscape. As Mike Carlton explains, “TVspots and other traditional work as the economic
backbone of the agency business will just not work much longer.”9However, Carlton also calls for
CHAPTER 1 • THE NEW WORLD OF MARKETING COMMUNICATION 27
agencies to take a stronger leadership role in the development of brand strategy, particularly for the
more complex forms of marketing communication with their blurred, merged, and converged media.

We mentioned that CareerBuilder had taken its advertising in house partly to drive a consumer-
generated advertising program, but also to save costs, which is critical in an economic downturn.
The need for efficiency is complicated by crack-ups in the agency–client relationships. Agencies
that are creative in finding new ways to deliver cost efficiencies have a real advantage in their
client dealings.

The most important characteristic of advertising is that it is purposeful: Ads are created to have
some effect, some impact on the people who read or see their message. We refer to this as advertis-
ing’s effects,the idea being that effective advertising messages will achieve the advertiser’s desired
impact and the target audience will respond as the advertiser intended. This desired impact is for-

Award Shows This chapter opened with the Burger King campaign, which was identified as
award-winning advertising. The Effie award, named for a shortened form of the word effective,is
given by the New York Chapter of the American Marketing Association (AMA) to advertising and
other forms of marketing communication that have been proven to be not only creative, but more
importantly, effective. That means the campaigns were guided by measurable objectives, and eval-
uation after the campaign determined that the effort did, in fact, meet or exceed the objectives.
(Check out the Effies at www.effie.org.) Other award shows that focus on effectiveness are the Ad-
vertising and Marketing Effectiveness (AME) awards by the New York Festivals company,
Canada’s Cassie Awards, and the London-based Institute of Practitioners (IPA) Award. Check out
these award programs at www.ameawards.com,www.cassies.ca,andwww.ipa.co.uk.
Other award shows judge factors such as creative ideas, for example, the Clios by a private
award-show company, a New York–based advertising association’s One Show, and the Cannes
Lions Awards by a French award-show company. Awards are also given for media plans
(Adweek’s Media Plan of the Year) and art direction (New York–based Art Directors Club award
show). These awards can be found at www.clioawards.com,www.canneslions.com,www.adweek
.com,andwww.adcglobal.org/awards/annual.
Other professional areas also have award shows that reward such things as clever promo-
tional ideas. For example, the Reggies are given by the Promotion MarketingAssociation, and

Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC)
We mentioned that effectiveness is a central theme for this book, but another concept that we will
discuss throughout is integration. As we mentioned earlier in our timeline, the search for effective
communication has led many companies to focus on the consistency of their brand communication
in order to more efficiently establish a coherent brand perception. We call that practice integrated
marketing communicationorIMC. In other words, everything that sends a brand message is a point
of concern for those managing brand communication. To be effective, these messages need to com-
plement one another and present the same basic brand strategy.

Looking Ahead
This chapter has provided an introduction to many of the basic concepts of advertising, as well as
IMC. We’ll continue that introduction of principles and practices in Chapter 2as we explain the
bigger picture of advertising and its role in marketing communication and marketing. Marketing
communication agencies play an important role in puzzling out new ways to interact with cus-
tomers and cement brand relationships.
IT’S A WRAP
Best Burger, Best Campaign,
Best Practices
The focus on effectiveness and results is the theme of this textbook, and throughout the book we will in-
troduce you to practices that generate effectiveness. We’ll end each chapter with the results of the cam-
paign that introduced the chapter—in this case, the Grand Effie–winning “Whopper Freakout” campaign for
Burger King. The freakout campaign for Whopper’s 50th anniversary demonstrates the power of having a
brand identity so strong that customers not only remember it, but demand it.
So here’s the rest of the Whopper story. It’s a story of consumer shock and outrage: “If Burger King doesn’t
have the Whopper, they might as well change their name to Burger Queen,” and “What are you going to put
on the logo now—home of the ‘whatever we got’?” griped outraged customers. When one stunned would-
be Whopper eater was given a Big Mac instead, he said, “I hate McDonald’s.”
These comments were all captured on tape and played and replayed on the special website by intrigued
viewers 5 million times. Fourteen million more watched it and the TV spots on YouTube. The agency figures
this all led to a 300(cid:2)percent increase in Web chatter about Burger King, which it estimates was about a fifth
of the paid media. That means it received about 20 percent of the media for free as consumers spread the
word. Burger King successfully captured its audience with a viral hit. Ad lesson #3:Smart thinking can help
you compete with competitors with bigger budgets.
Was the campaign effective? Did the captivated audience buy the burgers? The answer: the quarterly
sales increased by double digits. At the beginning of this case, you read about two goals for the campaign.
One was to reaffirm that the Whopper is America’s most-loved burger, and the other was to increase the sales
of the burger. This campaign achieved both of these measurable objectives.
What a way to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Whopper. To make the golden anniversary more
golden, the campaign was awarded a Gold Effie in the Restaurants category and the coveted Grand Effie, the
top award given to acknowledge effectiveness for the campaign’s “boldness and creativity across multiple
media platforms, delivering real cultural relevance and above all, outstanding business results.” Ad lesson #4:
Awards mean nothing if they don’t achieve the business goals.

Wii Wages Campaign in Video Game War
Imagine that you just landed your dream job with agency Leo Burnett, and you are
in charge of marketing Wii, a new video game for Nintendo. Here’s the situation
you’re facing. Once the category leader, Nintendo’s sales have plummeted so much
that one industry consultant advised your company to abandon the fight to compete
in the video game war. You think about the formidable rivalry from the Microsoft’s
popular Xbox 360 and Sony’s PlayStation 3. What do you do? Where do you start?
What makes Nintendo’s Wii campaign Ad Lesson #1is the insightful thinking
about those people whom the advertising aims to convince to become Wii con-
sumers. Think about PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 users. They’re usually male and
avid gamers—guys who like difficult and often violent games. Nintendo could have
chased those hardcore users. But it didn’t. Instead, Nintendo chose to appeal to
an audience who’d been turned off by video games—moms, families, even resi-
dents in nursing homes. Nintendo zigged when the competition zagged.
Such a bold strategy was not without risk. Some in the industry scoffed at the
daunting task of trying to persuade nonusers to become Wii enthusiasts. Nin-
tendo’s research showed that nonplayers voiced similar complaints about games
for other systems: they were too hard or complicated to learn. The nonplayers said
they enjoyed challenging games such as crossword puzzles and Sudoku, partici-
pating in sports leagues, and connecting with other people socially. They weren’t
game averse, but they held negative perceptions about video games.
Nintendo responded to the research findings with a Big Idea. Why not invite
the nonplayers to participate? Rather than talking about the power of the proces-
sor or pixel count as its competitors did, the “Wii Would Like to Play” campaign
focused on features that made its product different: motion-sensitive controllers
and prices lower than the competition’s. It lured people off their couches and in-
trigued them by showing a wide age range of people—family and friends—who
actively and interactively played simple games together.
Proving that Wii isn’t just for kids, Nintendo crafted a different kind of mar-
keting effort for a different kind of video game. Its multimillion-dollar campaign let
potential consumers touch, see, and experience the new game—Ad Lesson #2.

34 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL
Nintendo’s ambassador program featured parties for multigenerational families,
hard-core gamers, and modern moms. Others experienced Wii at malls, retail mid-
night madness events, music/video tours, and online social networking communi-
ties. Before Wii was even launched, it was featured in South Park, showed up on
the front page of The Wall Street Journal, and other popular media including
People magazine, NPR, and BusinessWeek.
Other efforts to spread the word included a MySpace page, which attracted a
million page views, brand partnerships with 7-Eleven, Pringles Snack Stacks, and
Comedy Central. Wii also showed up on the Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, and
Discovery Kids Network.
Given the need to teach people how to play the game on their home TV
screens, an important venue was in-person demonstrations either in stores or at
events, such as trade shows and video game expositions. The opening photo of
this chapter shows the president of Nintendo and the general manager of the en-
tertainment division playing a game of tennis on a large video screen during the
Electronic Entertainment Expo in Hollywood.

This chapter will give you a foundation for thinking about solving problems for clients. The Nin-
tendo story demonstrates how marketing communication can help accomplish marketing objec-
tives. It illustrates some fundamentals that will help you think through challenges you’re likely to
face in your career. This chapter starts with an explanation of the basic principles of marketing. We
then explore the important concept of branding and why it is so heavily dependent on marketing
communication. Finally we explain the concept of integrated marketing communication.
WHAT IS MARKETING?
Acompany like Nintendo needs effective marketing communication in order for its products to
succeed in the marketplace. However, to succeed, a product must also offer customers value, and
much of a product’s value is created by marketing decisions that determine the product’s design
and ease of use, distribution, and pricing, as well as its marketing communication.
Marketing is designed to build brand and customer relationships that generate sales and prof-
its or, in the case of nonprofits, memberships, volunteers, and donations. In turbulent times like
the marketing communication industry has been through with the Great Recession, it is useful to
remember the point we made in the Part I opener—that most of the basic marketing practices and
principles are not only still viable, but may provide the only way through the chaos. So let’s start
by defining basic marketing concepts and see how they relate to marketing communication.
Why Marketing 101?
Some of you reading this textbook are marketing majors but others have not had and may never
take a marketing course. For that reason, we will present here a quick crash course in those as-
pects of marketing that are most relevant to marketing communication.
Aprocess and a discipline, marketing is the way a product is designed, tested, produced,
branded, packaged, priced, distributed, and promoted. The American Marketing Association
CHAPTER 2 • INTEGRATED BRAND COMMUNICATION 35
(AMA) updated its definition of the term in 2007 as “Mar-
keting is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for cre-
ating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings
that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at
large.”1It is a function within an organization that focuses on
managing customer relationships to benefit all of a brand’s
stakeholders—by stakeholders we mean all the individuals
and groups who have a stake in the success of the brand. Pos-
itive relationships create value for a brand.
Traditionally, the objective of most marketing programs has
been to sell products, which we define as goods,services,orideas.
This is accomplished by matching a product’s availability—
and the company’s production capabilities—to the consumer’s
need, desire, or demand for the product. As you may re-

signs and formulations that appeal to fashion-conscious
young women.
Goods and services are identified in terms of their
product category.By category, we mean the classification
to which the product is assigned. For example, Harley-
Davidson is in the motorcycle category, Apple Macintosh is SHOWCASE
in the computer category, and Burger King is in the fast- The Urban Decay product line of cosmetics projects a street-

change. With the Wii launch, for example, bloggers noted that Nintendo strategically controlled
how many games were produced, and the scarcity seemed to create even more demand and, in
turn, publicity for the new Wii system.
In addition to economic exchange, marketing also facilitates communication exchange.

stores and grocery stores, which the marketing industry refers to as package goods(In
Europe these are called fast-moving consumer goods or fmcg.)
• Business-to-business (B2B) marketsconsist of companies that buy products or services to use
in their own businesses or in making other products. General Electric, for example, buys com-
puters to use in billing and inventory control, steel and wiring to use in the manufacture of its
products, and cleaning supplies to use in maintaining its buildings. Advertising in this category
tends to be heavy on factual content and information but it can also be beautifully designed as
Peter Stasiowski’s ads for Interprint demonstrate (see the previous Day in the Lifefeature).

• Channel markets,as discussed earlier, include members of the distribution chain, which is
made up of businesses we call resellers,orintermediaries.Channel marketing,the process
of targeting a specific campaign to members of the distribution channel, is more important now
that manufacturers consider their distributors to be partners in their marketing programs. As gi-
ant retailers such as Walmart become more powerful, they can even dictate to manufacturers
what products their customers want to buy and how much they are willing to pay for them.
Most advertising dollars are spent on consumer markets, although B2B advertising is be-
coming almost as important. Firms usually reach consumer markets through mass media and
other marketing communication tools. They typically reach the other three markets—industrial,
institutional, and channel or reseller—through trade and professional advertising in specialized
media, such as trade journals, professional magazines, and direct mail, but even more so through
personal sales and trade shows and promotions.
Why Is Services Marketing Important? When some people think about “products,” they only
think about goods. This is unfortunate because services are the dominant part of the economy in
most developed countries. Health care, for example, is one of the largest industries in the United
States and it is a service industry.
Marketing a service-based business, however, is different in a number of ways from mar-
keting goods. For one thing, the product—insurance, banking, travel planning—is often intangi-
ble, although some services that “touch things” have a more tangible dimension, such as lawn

What Key Concepts Drive Marketing Practices?
Historically marketers developed a product and then found a market for it. This is referred to as
aproduct-driven philosophy.The great inventive period surrounding the Industrial Revolution
saw patent medicines and over-hyped advertising flourish. Lydia Pinkham’s Vegetable Com-
pound, for example, made outrageous claims for a tonic with a base of 18 percent alcohol.3It was
certainly good for what ails you.

marketing concept involves two steps: (1) determine through research what the customer needs
and wants and (2) develop, manufacture, market, and service goods that fill those needs and
wants—that is, create solutions for customers’problems.
40 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL
Ideally, marketers are able to match consumer needs and
wants to their products, either those in the current line or prospec-
tive products in research and development (R&D).In business-to-
business marketing, the customer may even be involved as a
partner in designing a new product or service.
Marketing communication can be designed to acquire con-
sumer feedback that leads to insights into consumer decision
making. This information then feeds back into marketing plans,
where it can stimulate new product developmentsthat are bet-
ter designed to more efficiently and effectively meet customer
needs. The consumer-generated content mentioned in Chapter 1
has a parallel in marketing. For example, Threadless.com, an on-
line T-shirt retailer, invited consumers to create a T-shirt design
and upload it to the site where other consumers get to vote for
winners that will be offered for sale on the site.4
In advertising, the difference between a product and a con-
sumer focus lies in the orientation of the ad. Is it addressing a
consumer’s benefit or a product’s feature? Ideally it will do both
by interpreting product features in terms of consumer benefits.
United Airlines uses a consumer-focused approach for its Escapes
vacation planning service and a product focus for its Mileage
Plus frequent flyer program, which is shown here.
A note about terminology: We often use the words con-
sumerandcustomerinterchangeably, but there are some differ-
ences in meaning. Consumeris a general term for people who
buy and use products and services, which is almost all of us. It’s

effective? Why? visited a specific retailer. Customers have a closer link to a brand or a store because they have
taken action by buying or visiting. By virtue of that action, these people can be said to have a re-
lationship with a brand or store.
Differentiation, Competitive Advantage, and Positioning Although customer-centric market-
ing is important, marketing experts also point to the importance of differentiation as a selling
strategy. They recommend strategies that are informed by consumers, but led by fundamental
marketing decisions that make the brand stand out as differ-
ent from its competition, a process known as positioning.5
How a brand is different and superior in some way is
calledcompetitive advantage.This concept is referred to in
marketing strategy as product differentiation.The point of
difference is seen in the way the product is positioned relative
to its competitors. We’ll talk about positioning more in the
branding discussion later in this chapter and in Chapter 7. A
product can be differentiated and therefore positioned in a va-
riety of ways: by price, design, performance, distribution, and
brand image. In a market-driven economy, product features
and claims, such as quality and cheaper price, help marketers
establish an advantage over the competition.
Aclassic example of differentiation is Maytag washers,

quality of the product, as well as on creating a brand position in the
minds of consumers.
Added Value Another reason marketing communication activities are
useful, both to consumers and to marketers, is that they add value to a
product.Added valuerefers to a marketing communication activity that
makes the product more valuable, useful, or appealing to the consumer.
With no added value, why pay more for one brand over the competition?
Amotorcycle is a motorcycle, but a Harley-Davidson is a highly coveted
bike because of the brand image created by its advertising. Advertising
and other marketing communication not only showcase the product’s
value but also may add value by making the product appear more desir-
able. Providing news and useful information of interest to consumers
is another way that advertising adds value, as the United ad demon-
strates. An example comes from a commercial for Idaho Potatoes, which
provides information about peeling potatoes as a strategy to reinforce its
dominance of its category.

highprice. Consider a watch that costs $500—what does that price say? On one hand, it may say
that it’s a prestige or quality product; on the other hand, it might suggest that the watch is expen-
sive, maybe too expensive. In fact, the meaning of the price is dependent on the context provided
by the marketing communication, which puts the price in perspective.
Place (Distribution) It does little good to offer a good or service that will meet customers’needs
unless you have a mechanism for making the product available and handling the exchange of pay-
ment for the product. What marketers call distributionincludes the channels used to make the
product easily accessible to customers.
Puma, for example, is growing the market for its shoes and athletic apparel because of its
unusual approach to distribution. Its channel marketing strategy delivers Puma products to ex-
clusive and mass-market audiences, selling its edgy designs to trendy retailers and then placing
its more mainstream products in mall stores. Foot Locker might sell the GVspecial, a style based
on a retro Puma tennis shoe from its glory days 30 years ago; at the same time an independent
fashion store might carry a basketball shoe in fabrics like snakeskin or lizard. In recent years,
Puma has expanded its distribution program to include its own stores, which greet customers with
a unique shopping environment reflecting the personality of the Puma brand.
The choice of a distribution channel also sends messages. The image of an athletic shoe, like
Puma, can be quite different if it’s sold in Kmart, as opposed to Nordstrom. Marketing managers
consider a variety of channels when choosing distribution strategies.
The Internet has brought another distribution question. “Clicks or bricks” is a phrase used to
describe whether a product is sold online (clicks) or in a traditional store (bricks). Another distri-
bution strategy involves the use of intermediaries, such as retailers. Direct marketing compa-
nies, such as Lands’End and Dell, distribute their products directly without the use of a reseller.
CHAPTER 2 • INTEGRATED BRAND COMMUNICATION 43
The sale is totally dependent on the effectiveness of the direct-response advertising. The more fa-
miliar strategy of distributing the product through one or more distributors and retailers is what
we described earlier as channel marketing.
Another distribution-related strategy involves the distinction between push and pull strategies.
Apush strategydirects marketing efforts at resellers, and success depends on the ability of these in-
termediaries to market the product, which they often do with their own advertising. In contrast, a pull
strategydirects marketing efforts at the consumer and attempts to pull the product through the chan-
nel by intensifying consumer demand. The decision to use a push or pull strategy determines, to some
extent, the audience to be targeted and the nature of the demand to be addressed by the message.
Marketing Communication The last of the Four Ps is promotion,or what we call marketing com-
munication(marcom, for short), which includes such tools as advertising, public relations, sales pro-
motion, direct response, events and sponsorships, point of sale, digital media, and the communication
aspects of packaging, as well as personal sales, and a number of new forms of online and place-based
communication that have emerged recently. The rest of the book is focused on this element—our goal
is to help you understand how marketing communication works to support a marketing plan.
In Figure 2.2, note how we positioned marketing communication in the center of the Four Ps.
The point is, as you may remember from our First Principle of IMCin Chapter 1that everything
communicates.In practice, we can rephrase that to say everything in the marketing mix can send a
message.How the product is designed and how it performs, where the brand is sold, and at what
price—all of these marketing decisions send messages about the brand’s position, quality, and image.
In fact, we can rephrase that first principle again as “Everything a brand does,and some-
Principle
times what it doesn’t do,can send a message.”Unintentional messages come from brand experi-
Every part of the
ences; for example, a long wait on a customer service help line or the inability of a company marketing mix, not

than anything said in the advertising. That’s why it’s necessary to monitor all marketing elements sends a message.

One type of communication that we don’t discuss in
depth in this book is personal sales because in most compa-
nies it is managed separately from marketing communication.
Because that area is particularly important to marketing pro-
grams, however, we’ll briefly introduce it here. Personal
salesrelies on face-to-face contact between the marketer and
a prospective customer, rather than contact through media. In
contrast to most advertising, whose effects are often delayed,
marketers use personal selling to create immediate sales to
people who are shopping for a product. In Nintendo’s case, it
was important to have trained salespeople demonstrate how
to play the Wii video game.

is a common objective for trade promotion and advertising. Personal sales are even more impor-
tant in business-to-business marketing for reaching key decision makers within a company who
can authorize a purchase.
The management challenge, then, is to manage all of the messages delivered by all aspects
of the marketing mix, including marketing communication, so they work together to present the
brand in a coherent and consistent way.8
WHAT IS MARCOM’S ROLE IN BRANDING?
Amanagement function that creates the tangible and intangible elements of a brand is called
branding. Through effective marketing communication that establishes a unique identity, the
brand engages the hearts and minds of consumers in a process that differentiates similar products
from each other.
Given your experience, how would you define a brand? You have pieces of a definition from
our previous questions: past positive experience, familiarity, a promise, a position, an image.
Here’s how we would define a brand: A perception, often imbued with emotion, which results
from experiences with and information about a company or a line of products.Other definitions
point to a mixture of tangible and intangible attributes, as well as the symbolic importance of the
trademark, which stands for the brand, and the value the brand offers to both the consumer and
the company. We’ll explain these factors in the following discussion.

In fact, all organizations with a name can be considered brands. The A Matter of Practice
feature explains how organization brands are distinct from product brands. In particular, as inter-
national branding expert Giep Franzen explains: “Organizations should be aware that simply by
existing and interacting with others, an organization is branding itself. So branding the organiza-
tion is inevitable. It is going to happen whether the process is managed or not.”
Sometimes the difference between brands in the same product category lies in product
features—how the hamburger is made and the chemistry of the toothpaste—but often we
choose one brand over another because of a difference in the brand impressions we carry.
Companies make products but they sell brands. Abrand differentiates a product from its com-
petitors and makes a promise to its customers.
Branding involves a complex set of philosophies and activities. Asuccessful brand is the

A brand is a unified vision sion of the essence of the brand in which all the pieces and parts fit together perfectly in a coher-

system (the science). and a complex system (the science). In other words, marketing communicators are managing a
multiplicity of brand activities and programs that are interrelated and only work well to the ex-
tent that they work together. When they work together with a single vision of the brand essence,
like a great orchestra, the pieces and parts fit together perfectly generating meaning and creating
something value. That’s the art of brand management.
How Does a Brand Acquire Meaning?
Abrand is, in fact, a perception—an identification that we assign to the products we know and
use. What do we mean by that?
Think about this: why does one brand sell twice the number of products as another when
there is no basic difference in product attributes or performance and both brands sell for the same
price? The answer is—a difference in the brand meaning. Meaning-making ideas and images are
what marketing communication delivers to brands. This perception, this brand meaning,is the
one thing a brand has that can’t be copied. Competitors can make a similar product, but it’s dif-
ficult for them to make the same brand because brand meaning is built on personal impressions.
A Brand Is a Perception Abrand, then, is basically a perception loaded with emotions and feel-
ings (intangible elements), not just a trademark or package design (tangible elements). Tangible
features are things you can observe or touch, such as a product’s design, ingredients, components,

size, shape, and performance. Intangibles include the product’s perceived value, its brand image,
positive and negative impressions and feelings, and past experiences customers have had with the
brand or company. Intangibles are just as important as the tangible features because they create
the emotional bonds people have with their favorite brands and because they are impossible for
the competition to copy.
But even intangibles can lend monetary value and legal protection to a brand’s unique iden-
tity. Read Tales of Twitterjacking at www.pearsonhighered.com/moriartyand consider the impor-
tance of a brand presence in a situation faced by Twitter: the hacking and hijacking of its accounts.
All the impressions created by a brand’s tangible and intangible features come together as a
brand concept—the brand and what it means—that exists in people’s hearts and minds. It results
not only from experiences with the product, but also from messages acquired from marketing
communication. Such impressions are particularly important in what we call parity products
such as soap, gasoline, and other products with few distinguishing features. For these products,
feelings about the brand can become the critical point of difference.

The development of the Ivory Soap brand by Procter & Gamble in 1879 represented a ma-
jor advance in branding because of the way its makers built a meaningful brand concept to trans-
form a parity product—soap—into a powerful brand—Ivory. Just as the Macintosh “1984”
commercial in Chapter 1represents one of the all-time great ads, Ivory represents one of the all-
time great marketing stories.

CHAPTER 2 • INTEGRATED BRAND COMMUNICATION 47
A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE
It’s Pure and It Floats
A basic principle of branding is that a brand takes on
meaning when it makes a product distinctive within its
product category. Procter & Gamble accomplished that
by creating identity elements for its soap brand Ivory be-
fore anyone had thought of making a bar of soap a dis-
tinctive product. The Ivory brand identity system also
called attention to innovative features of the product.
Here’s the background story about how Ivory came to be
one of the first and most successful brands of all time.
Before the Civil War, homemakers made their own
soap from lye, fats (cooking grease), and fireplace ashes.
It was a soft, jelly-like, yellowish soap that would clean
things adequately, but if it fell to the bottom of a pail, it
dissolved into mush. In Victorian times, the benchmark
for quality soap was the highly expensive castile bar—a
pure white soap imported from the Mediterranean and
made from the finest olive oil.
William Procter and James Gamble, who were part-
ners in a candle-making operation, discovered a formula
that produced a uniform, predictable bar soap, which
they provided in wooden boxes to both armies during
the Civil War. This introduced the concept of mass pro-
duction and opened up a huge market when the soldiers
returned to their homes with a demand for the bars of
soap. But back at home the bars of soap were still yellow
and sunk to the bottom.
Procter & Gamble hired a chemist to create a white
bar equivalent to the legendary castile bar. The chemist’s
work represented the first time scientific-based research
and development (R&D) was used to design a product.

found that the total impurities in Ivory added up to only
0.56 percent, which was actually lower than that of the
castile bars. By turning that into a positive, Harley Proc-
ter wrote the legendary slogan that Ivory is “99 and

ity that became one of the most famous brand slogans
in marketing history.

The choice of a brand name for new products is tested for memorability and relevance. The
idea is that the easier it is to recognize the identity cues, the easier it will be to create awareness
of the brand. That also makes it easy to find and repurchase a brand, which is an important fac-
tor in customer repurchase decisions. Successful brand names have several characteristics:
• DistinctiveAcommon name that is unrelated to a product category, such as Apple for a
computer, ensures there will be no similar names creating confusion. It can also be provoca-
tive, as in the Virgin line.
• AssociationSubaru, for example, chose Outback as the name for its rugged SUVhoping the
name would evoke the adventure of the Australian wilderness.
• BenefitSome brand names relate to the brand promise, such as Slim-Fast for
weight loss and Head & Shoulders for dandruff control shampoo.
• HeritageSome brand names reflect the maker, such as H&R Block, Kellogg’s,
and Dr. Scholl’s. The idea is that there is credibility in a product when makers
are proud to put their names on it, particularly in some international markets,
such as Japan, where the company behind the brand is an important part of the
brand image.
• SimplicityTo make a brand name easier to recognize and remember, brand
names are often short and easy to pronounce, such as Tide, Bic, and Nike. Be-
cause of the increase in multinational marketing, it is also important that names
properly translate into other languages.
When Coke moved into the Chinese market in the late 1970s, it faced the im-
mediate problem of translating its well-known brand name into Chinese. Of course,
there are no equivalent Chinese words for CocaorCola,and phonetic-based trans-
lations were meaningless. The ingenious solution was to use a group of four charac-
ters (cid:3978)(cid:3966)(cid:3978)(cid:1060) the first half means “tasty” or “delicious,” the next two characters
together mean “really happy.” Although it has come to stand as a generic phrase for
cola, the name for Coke in Chinese is roughly “tasty happy” cola. So Coke owns the

characters and other visual cues, such as color and distinctive
typefaces.
Alogois similar to a cattle brand in that it stands for the
product’s source. Atrademarkis a legal sign that indicates
ownership. Originally these were simple symbols or initials
that silversmiths etched into their products, the “mark of the
trade.” In modern times, trademarks may include logos,
other graphic symbols, or even unusual renderings of the
brand name, such as the distinctive Coca-Cola script. A
trademark is registered with the government and the com-
pany has exclusive use of its trademark as long as it is used
consistently for that product alone.

promise. minds relative to its competitors—higher, lower, bigger, more expensive. Related to position
is the brand promise.From a consumer viewpoint, the value of a brand lies in the promise it
makes. “It floats” and “99 and 44/100 percent pure” are both promises that identify key sell-
ing points for Ivory Soap. In other words, the brand through its communication sets expecta-
tions for what a customer believes will happen when the product is used. Because of past
experience and advertising messages, you know what to expect—that’s what a brand promise
means.
Consistency is the backbone of a promise.The promise needs to be delivered not just by
the advertising but at all points of contact with a brand. Furthermore, the brand has to deliver
on the promise. Many weak brands suffer from overpromising. Using hype and exaggeration,
they promise more than they can deliver and consumers end up disappointed. If a cough drop
promises relief from throat irritation, then it better deliver that relief. If it also promises good
taste, then it better not disappoint with a bitter medicinal flavor. Successfully identifying and
thendeliveringthepromisearepartoftheplatformforbuildingalong-termbrandrelationship
withcustomers.
Brand Image and Personality Another aspect of brand meaning is brand image, which refers
to something more complex than a brand impression. More specifically a brand imageis a men-
tal picture or idea about a brand that contains associations—luxury, durable, cheap—as well as
emotions. These associations and feelings result primarily from the content of advertising and
other marketing communication. For example, what do you think of when you think of the
Marines, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, the Chicago Cubs, or Celestial Seasonings teas?
Abrand personalitysymbolizes the personal qualities of people you know—bold, fun, ex-
citing, studious, geeky, daring, boring, whatever. Probably the greatest brand personality ever cre-
ated was for Harley-Davidson. How do you describe the Harley brand personality? Partly it’s the
people who you associate with the brand, people you may think of as black-leather, devil-may-
care individuals who are a little on the outlaw side. It doesn’t matter that in their real lives, Harley

images and personalities.
Each brand sends a different message because of the image or personality it projects through
its marketing communication. If you give your mother a Tiffany watch, she knows you care and
were willing to spend a lot of money to demonstrate your caring. If you give a friend a Swatch,
you may be saying you think she’s a fashionista
and someone who likes to make a fashion state-
ment. If you give your little brother a generic
watch from Walmart, you might be saying that
he needs a timepiece that works even though he
may lose it or break it. Brands speak to us
through their images and personalities.
Abrand takes on a distinctive meaning as
the branding elements—identity, position, prom-
ise, image, and personality—come together to
create a coherent and unified perception.13

of these qualities add value to the brand and make it possible to give a familiar brand a pre-

ample of how a brand identity is designed and conveyed through various types of marketing
communication.
Brand valuecomes in two forms—the value to a consumer and the value to the corporation.
The first is a result of the experiences a customer has had with a brand; the second is a financial
measure, which we call brand equity.
On the customer side, some brands have loyal users who purchase the brand repeatedly.
Powerful brands are those that retain their customers who will repeatedly buy the product or ser-
vice.Brand relationshipprograms that lead to loyaltyare important brand strategies. Brand re-

stakeholders, as well as intellectual property, such as product formulations. These are
intangible assets beyond the tangible ones of plants, equipment, and land. When a
company is sold, a figure is calculated for the value of its brands—that’s the intangi-
ble side of corporate valuation.
Our Third Principle of IMC, then, is that brand relationships drive brand
value.That’s because brand relationships are built on a foundation of positive brand
experiences and truthful brand communication. The part of brand equity that is
based on relationships is also referred to as goodwill. It lies in the accumulation of
positive brand relationships, which can be measured as a level of personal attach-
ment to the brand that has revenue-producing potential.
Leveraging Brand Equity Brand managers will sometimes leverage brand equity
through a brand extension, which is the use of an established brand name with a re-
lated line of products. In effect, they launch new products but use the established name

dient branding like this works? Another practice is co-branding, which is a strategy that
uses two brand names owned by two separate companies to cre-
ate a partnership offering. Co-branding is a common practice for
credit cards, such as the Visa and United Airlines Mileage Plus
card. The new brand name is Mileage Plus but the card carries
both the Visa and United Airlines identity information. The idea
is that the partnership provides customers with value from both
brands.
Astrong brand may be attractive to other business partners,
as well, through a practice called brand licensing. In effect, a
partner company rents the brand name and transfers some of its
brand equity to another product. The most common example
comes from sport teams whose names and logos are licensed to
makers of all kinds of goods—shirts, caps, mugs, and other
memorabilia. You may also be aware of the practice of brand li-
censing for your own school. Universities and colleges generate
lots of money by licensing their names, logos, and mascots to
apparel makers, among many others.
Another way to leverage a brand is through ingredient
branding,which refers to the use of a brand name for a com-
ponent used in manufacturing in advertising and other promo-
tion. The most well-known example is the “Intel Inside”
phrase and logo used by other computer makers to call atten-
tion to the quality of the chips it uses in manufacturing its
products. Other examples of bragging about the quality of
components are found in advertising for outdoor wear that
announces the use of Gore-Tex, a lightweight, warm, water-
resistant fabric, and in food advertising that promotes the use
of NutraSweet or Hershey’s chocolate. For ingredient brand-
ing to be successful, the ingredient must have a high level of
awareness and be known as a premium product.

Ultimately, the stronger a brand is, the more value it has to all its stakeholders. Under-
standing how brands are built and managed requires an understanding of relationship-
building communication as the classic McGraw-Hill “client” ad illustrates.

fact, IMC is still a new concept and both professionals and professors are engaged in defining the
field and explaining how it works.
Total Brand Communication
Several things make the practice of IMC different from advertising. One is its focus on brand-
ing and brand communication. Duncan and Mulhern, the authors of a symposium report, explain
that, “IMC is, among other things, a process for doing advertising and promotion better and more
effectively in the process of building brands.”16
Tom Duncan, one of the architects of this new professional area, explains that IMC origi-
nally started out as focused on creating “one voice, one look” marketing communication, but
companies broadened that focus as they realized the need for greater consistency for all aspects
of brand communication and customer relationships.17So the meaning of IMC has expanded be-
yond traditional marketing communication and encompasses what we are calling in this book “to-
tal brand communication.”
It might be helpful to consider how all of the communication we’ve been discussing fits to-
gether. Here’s the scheme: advertising and other marcom areas comprise the tools of marketing com-
munication in an IMC program. On a broader level, traditional marcom tools work with other

management implications of IMC. In terms of practice, managing and monitoring all of these
messages is an organizational problem best solved through cross-functional organization,
which means a team is created involving members from all of the relevant parts of a company
that interact with customers, other stakeholders, and with outside agencies. Its members rep-
resent all of the areas and tools that control contact points and interact with brand customers
and other key stakeholders. This cross-functional team operates with a singular brand vision
as it plans marketing communication, monitors its impact, and tracks consumer response.

CHAPTER 2 • INTEGRATED BRAND COMMUNICATION 55
IMC Principles and Practices
In Chapter 1and in this chapter we have introduced several IMC principles, as well as practices
that guide the use of integrated marketing communication. We’ll continue to introduce these prin-
ciples in the chapters that follow, but just to help you summarize what we’ve discussed so far,
here are the first four.
First Principle of IMC:Everything communicates.
Practice 1.1:Everything in the marketing mix can send a message.
Practice 1.2:Everything a brand does, and sometimes what it doesn’t do, can send a
message.
SecondPrincipleofIMC:Abrandisaunifiedvision(theart)andacomplexsystem(thescience).
Third Principle of IMC:Brand relationships drive brand value.
Fourth Principle of IMC:You can’t be integrated externally if you are not integrated internally.
Integrated marketing communication is an important philosophy, as well as practice. It is a ma-
jor theme in this book and we will continue to discuss it in the chapters that follow.
BRAND COMMUNICATION IN A TIME OF CHANGE
In Chapter 1, we concluded that advertising is a dynamic industry and subject to challenges and
change. The same is true of marketing and all areas of marketing communication. The recession
of the late 2000s challenged many marketing practices but some companies came through it more
easily than others. General Mills, for example, supported its big-name brands by increasing its
marketing budgets. The company focused, however, on what it calls “high ROI (return on in-
vestment) areas,” such as multicultural consumers, digital marketing,and its international mar-
kets and global brands.19So let’s consider ways in which the practice of marketing is changing,
particularly in this post-recession period.
Accountability
Similar to the concern for effectiveness in advertising, accountability is a hot issue in marketing.
Marketing managers are being challenged by senior management to prove that their decisions
lead to the most effective marketing strategies. In other words, was this the best way to launch a
new brand or expand into a new territory?
Jim Stengel, retired global marketing officer for P&G and now a UCLAbusiness professor,
mentioned several of these areas in an analysis of changing practices in marketing and the need
they created for better measurement of effectiveness. He called attention to two major areas of
concern—accountability and global marketing.20Accountability is what Stengel called for in his
quest for better measurement.
Marketing managers are under pressure to deliver business results measured in terms of
sales increases, the percentage share of the market the brand holds, and corporate return on in-
vestment (ROI). The calculation of ROI determines how much money the brand made com-
pared to its expenses. In other words, what did the marketing program cost, and what did it
deliver in sales?
Advertising and other marketing communication agencies are creating tools and techniques
to help marketers evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of their marketing communication ex-
penditures. The Interpublic Group, for example, a large marketing communication holding com-
pany, has created the Marketing Accountability Partnership to determine what marketers’dollars
accomplish or how they can be better used.21The issue of accountability is made more compli-
cated by the growing use of global marketing.
Global Marketing
Marketers have moved into global markets, in some cases as a deliberate strategy and in other
cases because international competitors have moved into their own markets. General Mills
56 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL
Here are a few brands that represent
different types of geographical
marketing strategies. Sainsbury’s, an
example of regional marketing, is the
largest grocery retailer in the United
Kingdom with stores in Great Britain,
Wales, Scotland, and Northern
Ireland. IKEA furniture stores are
found in various countries but the
company keeps its base and image
firmly anchored in Sweden and

survived the Great Recession by emphasizing its international markets and global brands, as well
as multicultural consumers in all the markets, including in the United States.22
The growth in global marketing activities is increasing dramatically, so it’s helpful to un-
derstand some of what makes global marketing different from national marketing. In most coun-
tries markets are composed of local, regional, international, and global brands. Alocal brandis
one marketed in a single country. Aregional brandis one marketed throughout a region (for ex-
ample, North America, Europe, China, India). An international brandis available in a number
of different countries in various parts of the world. Aglobal brandis available virtually every-
where in the world, such as Coca-Cola.
Marketing programs that manage and promote the same brand in several countries or glob-
ally are practicing international marketing.International marketing communication did not ap-
pear in any organized manner until the 20th century.
International marketing and marketing communication are not the exclusive province of
large companies. Bu Jin, an innovative small Colorado company, creates and markets martial

arts products worldwide. With only eight full-time employees, its products serve a high-end in-
ternational market. Most of Bu Jin’s business is driven by its catalog. (Check it out at
www.bujindesign.com.) Service providers also market internationally. Airlines and transporta-
tion companies that serve foreign markets, such as United and UPS, are, in effect, exporting a
service.
Regardless of the company’s form or style of management, the shift from national to inter-
national management requires new tools for marketers, including one language (often English),
one control mechanism (the budget), and one strategic plan (the brand strategy).

Chapter18.
Looking Ahead
In this changing marketplace, how responsible the brand is seen to be in terms of its impact on
society and the environment can be important to the brand’s strategy. Social responsibility is the
focus of the next chapter and presents issues related to the social impact of marketing communi-
cation, as well as marcom ethics and regulation.
IT’S A WRAP
Winning Video Game
War with Wii
Leo Burnett’s Wii campaign for Nintendo beat the competition at their own game. The results of the cam-
paign were nothing short of a blowout. For its short-term goal, Nintendo wanted to sell 600,000 units from
its launch in November through the end of the year. It nearly doubled that goal, outselling its Sony rival by
more than 50 percent during that period. A midterm objective aimed to make Nintendo a rival with Sony and
Microsoft by gaining at least a third of the market by the end of 2007. It beat the year-end goal in less than
six months. Amazingly in July sales topped the combined sales for both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The long-
term goal of fundamentally changing how people experience video games paid off too. Wii parties became
the rage. The key purchasers, moms, decided that the Wii was okay for their families. All sorts of people from
young families to retirees caught the Wii bug, got off the couch, and started to play.
Nintendo was honored for its effective efforts with a Grand Effie. “Leo Burnett’s marketing strategy for
the Wii will forever change the gaming industry and its dialogue with consumers,” said Deborah Meyer, who
chaired the Grand Effie jury. This phenomenal marketing effort continues to pay dividends, as Nintendo re-
cently was judged tops in game ads for effectiveness and impact in print, television, and digital media.

Häagen-Dazs Creates a Buzz about Bees

lapse disorder or “CCD.” When this condition happens, bees mysteriously aban-
dontheirhives.
How does this crisis relate to Häagen-Dazs? This premium ice cream uses only
all-natural ingredients, and bee pollination is essential for ingredients in nearly half
of its flavors. It’s in the best interest of the company, as well as the bees, to resolve
the problem. This is the story about how a company practices social responsibility,
or shows concern for the welfare of others, and profits from the experience.
Faced with a need to ramp up sales and inject zip into the Häagen-Dazs brand
(whose main competitor is funkier, socially conscious Ben & Jerry’s), the client
asked its ad agency, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, and the PR firm Ketchum to
accomplish these objectives with no increase in budget. In such a situation, it made
sense to generate a buzz that could extend the impact of its message beyond the
limited media budget for advertising. What Häagen-Dazs discovered was a prob-
lem more important than the brand.
Summarizing the situation, three factors led to the big idea for the campaign:
a brand known for its all-natural ingredients, consumers who are increasingly con-
cerned about sustainability and environmental issues, and a critical issue. The idea
centered on a simple equation: 1/2 of Häagen-Dazs ice cream flavors (cid:2)1/3 of what
we eat (cid:3)honeybees = a bigger-than-ice-cream problem.
To help find a solution, Häagen-Dazs’s ad agency, Goodby, Silverstein & Part-
ners, and public relations firm, Ketchum, created the “Häagen-Dazs Loves Honey
Bees” program. Häagen-Dazs kicked off its multifaceted efforts to help solve the
honeybee mystery by giving substantial research grants to Penn State and UC

Davis scientists. An expert advisory “Bee Board,” comprised of scientists and bee-
keepers, served as sources for news media. Häagen-Dazs created advertorials, ad-
vertising that looks like editorial matter in newspapers or magazines, about the bee
problem, which ran in key magazines, such as National GeographicandGourmet.
Häagen-Dazs even created a new flavor, Vanilla Honey Bee, and earmarked the
profits for CCD research.
Other components of the program spread the message to its audience. The
www.helpthehoneybees.comsite educated consumers about the crisis and invited
their involvement. The online presence allowed consumers to purchase T-shirts and
even send “bee-mail” to friends. Häagen-Dazs funded a six-minute documentary
about CCD that is available on the Serious Eats website (www.seriouseats.com). A
“Bee Dance” video was launched on YouTube. Häagen-Dazs encouraged con-
sumer involvement by distributing more than a million free bee-friendly seeds in
HD loves HB packets.
Häagen-Dazs counted on the people who heard its message to spread the
word. For example, a reader who happened to be an employee of Whole Foods
read the National Geographicpiece and inspired Northern California Whole Foods
stores to create honeybee displays featuring Häagen-Dazs and CCD.
Although the bee problem was the center of the communication, selling a
brand was still important. Häagen-Dazs hopes that when you crave premium ice
cream, you’ll choose its Vanilla Honey Bee or Dulce de Leche over Ben & Jerry’s
Cherry Garcia or Phish Food flavors, partly because it’s a brand that cares.
Was this effort to be socially responsible successful? In what ways? Turn to the
end of the chapter to see how Häagen-Dazs measured the effectiveness of these
efforts.

Caring for the environment and promoting a product can be mutually beneficial, as the “Häagen-
Dazs Loves Honey Bees” case demonstrates. By raising public awareness about the plight of the
honeybees, Häagen-Dazs also benefited its ice cream business. This chapter reminds us that as
communicators we make choices. We have the power to use our talents to leave the world a bit
better than we found it. This chapter helps you explore the impact of brand communication on so-
ciety. We present ongoing debates about the power of advertising, look at issues related to social
responsibility, and contemplate emerging issues related to digital media. You will examine your
personal and professional ethics related to brand communication. Finally, you will read about the
legal aspects of advertising and regulatory processes that are in place to make sure harmful com-
munication is minimized.
WHAT IS THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF BRAND COMMUNICATION?
Häagen-Dazs’s campaign to align itself with a good cause demonstrates that marketing commu-
nication might help make the world a little better. The Häagen-Dazs case shows that marketers
can think beyond the campaign’s immediate benefits to consider how their actions might affect a
larger sphere—society and the natural environment. Donating a fortune to help the unfortunate,
as Bill and Melinda Gates of Microsoft fame have done, is another way for companies to prove
their worth. Think about all of the companies such as Nestlé, Coca-Cola, AT&T, Target, and Wal-
mart who pitched in to help victims of the Haiti earthquake.
CHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY 65
“Avon Commits $1 Million to Support Relief Efforts” in earthquake-
ravaged Haiti. “Coca-Cola Commits to Climate Friendly Refrigeration.”
“Kraft Foods Employees Honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s Legacy
Across the Country.” These headlines1 demonstrate that professional
brand communicators have the potential to do good, although too many
examples show that communicators sometimes fail to act responsibly.

Do you think advertising itself is inherently good or bad for society?
Most of the time people use advertising for neutral or good purposes,
meaning they value a brand’s social responsibility.To emphasize the im-
portance of this topic, sprinkled throughout this book are A Principled
Practicesboxes that discuss issues of social and ethical responsibility.
Advertising sometimes draws criticism for its social impact and
much of the discussion that follows is focused on advertising because it
is so highly visible. Check out www.AdBusters.orgfor a look inside the
world of advertising criticism. We start this chapter with three important
debates concerning the role of advertising and marketing communica-
tion as institutions in society that will help you understand different as-
pects of social responsibility.

Demand Creation Some critics charge that advertising causes demand creation,which results
when an external message drives people to feel a need or want—sometimes unnecessarily. A2009
Harris Poll indicated that two-thirds of Americans believed ad agencies were at least partially to
blame for the recent economic crisis because they caused people to buy things they couldn’t af-
ford.2Others reject this notion. Does advertising create demand for products people don’t need?
Has advertising convinced you to buy products you don’t need?

If you think it doesn’t happen today, think about Unilever’s Axe product. Axe pioneered the
new category of body spray for men in 2002. Did guys know before 2002 that they needed scented
body spray? Is it a good thing advertising convinces people to buy products like deodorants and
body sprays? Can such advertising improve consumers’lives?
Companies often conduct significant research to find out what consumers want before they
launch new products. If people do not want the products being marketed, they do not buy them.

66 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL
Shaping versus Mirroring Another important debate about advertising’s role
in society questions the limits of its influence. At what point does advertising
cross the line between reflecting social values and creating them? Professionals
believe they are reflecting the values of their society. Critics argue that adver-
tising has repeatedly crossed this line, influencing vulnerable groups, such as
children and young teenagers, too strongly.
Acase in point: Do ultra-thin models in advertising cause young women
to have eating disorders, as some have claimed? While it is probable that the im-
ages women and girls see influence them in some ways, it’s difficult to say that
these images directly and solely cause the problem, because many factors in a
person’s environment potentially influence eating choices. Some research,
however, supports the view that advertising is partly to blame; advertising may
contribute to the problem. What do you think?
Can advertising manipulate people’s choices? Critics of advertising argue
that advertising can create social trends and has the power to dictate how people
think and act. They believe that even if an individual ad cannot control behavior,
the cumulative effects of nonstop television, radio, print, Internet, and outdoor
ads can be overwhelming. Others contend that effective brand communication
spots trends and then develops messages that connect target audiences with the
trends. In other words, if people are interested in achieving healthy lifestyles, you
will see ads that use health appeals as an advertising strategy. In this way, ad-
vertising mirrors values rather than sets them. Do you agree with that argument?
One example of using advertising to try to change society and improve the
world while still selling products is the RED campaign, instigated by U2 singer
Bono in conjunction with major companies like Apple, Gap, and Hallmark. The
purpose of the campaign is to sell RED-branded products to help fight AIDS
and HIVin Africa. Does Product RED advertising mirror a societal concern for
Africans’welfare or does it shape how we think about the problem, or both? An-
other example of attempting to influence society is the award-winning “Open
for Business” poster that appeared after the 9/11 tragedy.
This shaping-versus-mirroring debate is the most central issue we address
in considering advertising’s role in society. What drives consumers to behave or
believe as they do? Is it advertising, or is it other forces? Why do women buy
cosmetics, for example? Are they satisfying a deep cultural need for beauty, or
were they manipulated by advertising to believe in the hope that cosmetics of-
fer? Women can even purchase a product by the cosmetics company Philoso-
phy called Hope in a Jar. Or have their families and friends socialized them to
believe they look better with cosmetics than without? Advertising and society’s
values are probably interactive, so the answer to the debate may simply be that
advertising both mirrors and shapes values.
Overcommercialization Does advertising lead people to be too materialistic?
The second half of the 20th century is notable for the rise of a materialistic con-
sumer culture in the Western world. Did advertising create this culture, or does

them. As we have said, they have the power to refuse to buy what is being sold.
Another facet of this debate relates to a problem that emerges if the walls blur between ad-
vertising and news and entertainment. If advertising becomes intertwined with news, how will
audiences know whether news stories are free from editorial pressure from sponsors who want to
control what is said about their brands? As product placement becomes increasingly prevalent,
how does that affect entertainment? Does the influence of advertising, for example, change how

2,000 product placements in American Idol,especially when a lot of viewers are under 16?4
Other Social Responsibility Issues
To help you understand issues that advertisers face when they can have a direct impact and make
a difference to society, we’ll discuss six key topics: (1) taste and offensive advertising, (2) sex ap-
peals, (3) diversity issues, (4) message-related issues, (5) product-related issues, and (6) emerg-
ing issues with digital media. If you’re interested in these and other related topics, visit the
Advertising Educational Foundation website at www.aef.comfor more information.
Poor Taste and Offensive Advertising Although certain ads might be in bad taste in any cir-
cumstance, viewer reactions are affected by such factors as sensitivity to the product category,
timing (if the message is received in the middle of dinner, for example), and other circumstances,
such as whether the person is alone or with others when viewing the message. Some television
ads, for example, might not bother adults watching alone but would make them uncomfortable if
children were watching.
Also, questionable ads become offensive in the wrong context. Advertisers and media out-
lets must try to be sensitive to such objections. Recently, outraged advertisers including Apple-
bee’s, General Mills, and Kraft pulled ads from Fox News Channel’s Glenn Beckprogram after
the host called President Obama a “racist” with a “deep-seated hatred for white people.”5
We all have our own ideas about what constitutes good taste. Unfortunately, these ideas vary

ads for male body sprays? Do you find them offensive or in good taste?
An ad can be offensive to the general public even if the targeted audience accepts it. Brand
communicators would be wise to conduct research to gauge the standards of taste for the general
population as well as the specific target audience. If they fail to do so, advertisers risk alienating
potential consumers. Such was the case with Abercrombie and Fitch’s sexually explicit ads aimed
at young teens that spawned a grassroots campaign to stop the company’s marketing tactics. Some
might argue that any publicity is good publicity, and offensive advertising calls attention to your
product in a memorable way.
TheA Principled Practicebox by Herbert Rotfeld discusses this topic in more detail.
Sex Appeals and Body Image Advertising that portrays women (or men) as sex objects is con-
sidered demeaning and sexist, particularly if sex is not relevant to the product. Sometimes ads use
sex appeals that are relevant to the product, such as those used by Victoria’s Secret. The ethical
question then is how sexy is too sexy. Transit authorities in two Canadian cities decided Virgin
Mobile’s ads were too racy for the public and asked the company to pull risqué ads from bus shel-
ters that showed embracing couples and invited viewers to “Hook up fearlessly.”6 Explicitly
using sex appeals to sell may not always be appropriate as Professor Rotfeld argued in the A Prin-
cipled Practicefeature.
Playing on consumers’insecurities about their appearance presents advertisers with a classic
ethical dilemma because self-image advertising can be seen as contributing to self-improvement,
but sometimes, such advertising is questionable because it leads to dangerous practices. Some
critics charge that women place their health at risk in order to cultivate an unrealistic or even un-
healthy physical appearance. Supermodels don’t always project healthy portrayals of women.
Critic and author Jean Kilbourne claimed, “ads are aimed at the very heart of girls’insecurities’
because of the ideal image of beauty that they portray: ‘an absolutely perfect-looking young
woman who’s incredibly thin’.”7
Do you think advertising sends this message? Messages that only feature thin models nor-
malize the thin ideal of beauty. Young women and even men can become obsessed with their
weight to the point that they believe they are attractive only if they are unnaturally thin. The
“Dove Campaign for Real Beauty” that you’ll read about in Chapter 5 defies the notion that
women need to be thin to be beautiful.

The same problem of physical appearance exists for men, particularly young men, although
the muscular ideal body may not lead to the same health-threatening reactions that young women
face, unless men resort to steroids to attain this image. The standard of attractiveness is a socio-
cultural phenomenon that both mirrors and shapes our ideals. Responsible advertisers, therefore,
have begun using models of more normal size and weight as a way to reduce the pressure on
young people.

instance.
The issue of stereotyping also raises the shaping-versus-mirroring question. For example,
stereotyping women as sex objects is a practice that is deeply embedded in our culture, however
negatively some might see that value. Using such strategies also makes advertising a participant
in shaping and reinforcing that cultural value.
CHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY 69
Intentionally or not communicators choose how they
portray people in their ads. Whether you believe advertising
has the ability to shape our values and our view of the world
or whether it mirrors society, communicators have a respon-
sibility to ensure that what is portrayed is accurate and rep-
resentative. Diversity has become an issue as advertisers
struggle to target, as well as portray, people outside the
white, straight mainstream market.
Next we discuss some of the most common problems
found in the way advertising portrays people.
Gender Stereotypes Stereotyped gender images abound in
the media—dumb blondes, the rugged western Marlboro
man, and the clueless buffoon who appears in ads, comics,
and programs as a bungling dad are all examples. One of the
most important lessons media teach is how people fit into
culturally shared gender and racial roles. The way men and
women are cast as characters in advertisements and pro-
grams can create or reinforce cultural stereotypes.8
Historically, advertising has portrayed gender in dis-
tinct and predictable stereotypes. Men are usually shown as
strong, independent, and achievement oriented; women are
shown as nurturing and empathetic, but softer and more de-
pendent, and they are told that the products being advertised
will make their lives less stressful and more manageable.
Men are often negatively stereotyped as well. The organiza-
tion FathersAndHusbands.org formed to promote positive
images of men in the media.
Astudy of gender representation in 1,300 prime-time
commercials found that although women make most pur-
chases of goods and services, they are underrepresented as
primary characters during most prime-time commercials, ex-
cept for health and beauty products. Women are cast as

graphic design association.
They functioned in multiple roles, not just as career women
or supermoms, and men even appeared as house-husbands
and nurturing fathers.
Afew adventurous companies have even begun to show images of gays in advertising to
general audiences. Such images have appeared fairly extensively in mainstream fashion adver-
tising for brands such as Calvin Klein, Benetton, and Banana Republic. The coming-out episode
of ABC’s Ellenwas groundbreaking in more ways than just programming—it was the first time
advertisers used prime-time network TVto reach gay and lesbian viewers. Now it’s not unusual
to see gays and lesbians portrayed as multidimensional characters on shows such as Glee,Mod-
ern Family,andGrey’s Anatomy.Viacom’s LOGO, a 24-hour gay channel, is supported by a host
of national advertisers trying to reach this audience.
Racial and Ethnic Stereotypes Think about sports teams like the Washington Redskins, Kansas
City Chiefs, or Cleveland Indians that reduce Native Americans to a caricature, and you’ll know
why some critics claim that racial and ethnic groups are stereotyped in advertising. Do you be-
lieve these team names and logos represent negative stereotypes and, if so, what should be done
about them when millions of dollars have been invested in them as brands? The portrayal of Ital-
ian Americans as ignorant Mafioso types in a Verizon Wireless commercial prompted one blog-
ger to complain, “It is so common to see Italian Americans negatively portrayed by Hollywood
and Madison Avenue that our society doesn’t think twice when we see garbage such as this. . . .”
70 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL
Should we permit the media to profit from all the unflattering and nasty stereotypes about blacks,
Jews, Asians, Muslims, Irish, and Latinos?”11
Cultural Differences in Global Advertising In the global economy advertisers seek worldwide
audiences for their products. As they do so, advertisers sometimes make mistakes of overlaying
their worldview on that of another culture without thinking about the impact of their advertising.
Many oppose the move to a global perspective because of concerns about the homogenization of
cultural differences. Marketing imperialismorcultural imperialismis a term used to describe
what happens when Western culture is imposed on others, particularly the Middle East, Asian,
and African cultures. Some Asian and Middle Eastern countries are critical of what they see as
America’s materialism and disrespectful behavior toward women and elders. They worry that
international advertisingand media will encourage their young people to adopt these viewpoints.
Cultural differences are very real, and we will talk more about them throughout the book.
Consider that respect for culture and local customs is so important that insensitivity to local cus-
toms can make an ad completely ineffective. Customs can be even stronger than laws. When ad-
vertising to children age 12 or older was approved in Germany, for example, local customs were
so strong that companies risked customer revolt by advertising. In many countries, naming a com-
petitor in comparative advertising is considered bad form.
Age-Related Stereotypes Another group that critics say is often subject to stereotyping is senior cit-
izens, a growing segment of the population with increasing amounts of disposable income. In a focus
group of women in their 50s, participants had trouble keeping their comments polite when viewing a
series of health care ads that showed older women in primarily sedentary activities. One explained that
even though she has arthritis, she still wants to see ads that show arthritis sufferers working out in a
gym, rather than “silver-haired couples walking along the beach with a golden retriever.”12
BarbaraChampion,presidentofaresearchfirmspecializinginthematuringmarket,observed:

stage factors, are often different from one another. Whether a consumer is an empty-nester
whose children have grown up and left home, a grandparent, a retiree, a widow, or in need
of assisted living, for example, will greatly affect how, when, and why goods and services
are purchased.”13
Many of the ads for Viagra speak to a specific segment of the population and do so in a taste-
ful, tactful way.
Advertising to Children Marketing to youth is one of the most controversial topics in the in-
dustry. One reason why advertising to children attracts so much attention is that children are seen
as vulnerable. Children do not always know what is good for them and what is not. Concerned
adults want to make sure that they protect impressionable minds from exploitation marketers.
They want to help children learn to make good choices.

Marketing alcohol to black teens is another important issue because of the use of rappers like
Ice-T to promote malt liquors and the dozens of pages of alcohol ads that appear in black
youth–culture magazines such as Vibe.AGeorgetown University study contends that the alcohol
beverage industry is marketing far more heavily to African American young people than to oth-
ers in that age group.

Misleading claims are not just a problem in the United States. The London-based Barclays
credit card was forced by the U.K. government to withdraw an advertising campaign that prom-
ised “0 percent forever.” The ad was deemed deceptive because borrowers would enjoy the no-
interest offer for only as long as it took for the balance to be cleared. In other words, all new

looking for false or misleading claims because it is so innocuous.
Because obviously exaggerated “puffing” claims are legal, the question of puffery is mainly
an ethical one. According to the courts, consumers expect exaggerations and inflated claims in
advertising, so reasonable people wouldn’t believe that these statements (“puffs”) are literal facts.
However, empirical evidence on the effectiveness of puffery is mixed. Some research suggests
that the public might expect advertisers to be able to prove the truth of superlative claims, and
other research indicates that reasonable people do not believe such claims. This is particularly im-
portant when advertising to children who might not know the difference between fact and opin-
ion. Noted advertising scholar Ivan Preston does not think all puffs deserve to be protected legally
as he explains in the A Matter of Principlefeature that follows.
Comparative Advertising We’re used to seeing advertisers take on their competition in an
ad—Mac vs. PC, Dunkin’Donuts vs. Starbucks, Campbell’s Soup vs. Progresso. Although

In addition to the federal laws, consumers also may rely on state laws governing unfair com-
petition and false ad claims if the consumer is the victim of a false comparative claim.
Endorsements and Demonstrations Apopular advertising strategy is the use of a spokesperson
who endorses a brand. That’s a perfectly legal strategy, unless the endorser doesn’t actually use
the product. An endorsementortestimonialis any advertising message that consumers believe
CHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY 73
reflects the opinions, beliefs, or experiences
of an individual, group, or institution. How-
ever, if consumers can reasonably ascertain
that a message does not reflect the an-
nouncer’s opinion, the message isn’t an en-
dorsement and may even be misleading.
Consider the billboard of President
Obama wearing a Weatherproof-brand jacket
during his visit to the Great Wall of China. The
company put the image on its website for a
time and promoted “the Obama jacket” until
the White House asked that they take down the
billboard. It claimed the ad was misleading be-
cause the company never received approval or
an endorsement from the president.18
The increasing prominence of digital
media raises another ethical dilemma. Is it ac-
ceptable for company representatives to
pose as consumers or pay bloggers to post endorsements as customer reviews online? The Word Weatherproof, an
of Mouth Marketing Association says no. Its ethics code19 explicitly prohibits consumers from apparel company

be liable if the government determines there is deception.
Product demonstrations in television advertising also must not mislead consumers. This
mandate is especially difficult for advertisements of food products because such factors as hot
studio lights and the length of time needed to shoot the commercial can make the product look
unappetizing. Think about the problems of shooting ice cream under hot lights. Because milk
looks gray on television, advertisers often substitute a mixture of glue and water. The question is
whether the demonstration falsely upgrades the consumers’perception of the advertised brand.
The FTC evaluates this kind of deception on a case-by-case basis.
One technique some advertisers use to sidestep restrictions on demonstrations is to insert
disclaimers or “supers,” verbal or written words in the ad that indicate exceptions to the adver-
tising claim made. You’ve probably seen car commercials that start with beauty shots of the prod-
uct. Suddenly, the message is less clear; for several seconds five different, often lengthy,
disclaimers flash on the screen in tiny, eye-straining type, including “See dealers for details and
guaranteed claim form” and “Deductibles and restrictions apply.”
Product-Related Issues Marketers need to consider carefully what they choose to produce and
advertise. Some key areas of concern include controversial products, unhealthy or dangerous
products such as alcohol and tobacco, and prescription drugs. The decision to produce the prod-
uct lies with the marketing department and the company’s business objectives, but advertising is
frequently in the spotlight because of its visibility.
Before an agency can create an ad for a client, it must consider the nature of the client com-
pany and its mission, marketing objectives, reputation, available resources, competition, and,
most importantly, product line. Can the agency and its staff honestly promote the products being
advertised? What would you do if you were a copywriter for an agency that has a political client
you don’t support? Several agencies have resigned from profitable tobacco advertising accounts
because of the medical evidence about the harm cigarettes cause. In cases where the agency works
on a controversial account, there are still ethical ways to approach the business.
Controversial Products Marketing communication reflects the marketing and business ethics of
its clients and, because of its visibility, sometimes gets the blame for selling controversial, unsafe,

visible face of marketing.
Unhealthy or Dangerous Products One way to make ethical decisions is to choose the route that
minimizes potential harm. Because there has been so much negative publicity about the health ef-
fects of eating a steady diet of heavily processed food, food companies, particularly fast-food pro-
ducers such as McDonald’s and KFC, have reacted to charges of culpability in the nation’s obesity
problem. McDonald’s slimmed down Ronald McDonald, added healthier choices to its menu, and
moved away from using cholesterol-causing saturated fats when making French fries. Disney
launched efforts to serve healthier food in its theme parks as an effort to improve the diets of chil-
dren. Wendy’s reduced the amount of trans fats it uses for cooking.22
One of the most heated advertising issues in recent years has been about tobacco advertising.
Although Congress passed a law that banned cigarette advertising on television and radio starting
in 1971, that did not resolve the issue. Proponents of the ban on cigarette advertising argue that
since cigarettes have been shown to cause cancer as well as other illnesses, encouraging tobacco
use promotes sickness, injury, or death for the smoker and those inhaling secondhand smoke. They
argue that further restricting advertising on those products would result in fewer sales and fewer
health problems for America as a whole.
Opponents of advertising bans counter with the argument that prohibiting truthful, nondecep-
tive advertising for a legal product is unconstitutional and a violation of their free speech rights. They
feel that censorship is more of a problem than advertising a legal product, even if it is unhealthy.
In recognition of the growing public concerns about cigarette marketing, tobacco compa-
nies have voluntarily curbed their advertising and pulled ads from magazines with high levels
of youth readership and from most outdoor billboards. Most major tobacco companies also run
anti-smoking ads aimed at teenagers. Philip Morris has virtually stopped advertising and shifted
SHOWCASE
To solve a local crisis in Iceland with its image, Shell used a campaign based on the slogan “Shell—with you all the
way.” The campaign demonstrated how Shell is involved and “travels” with customers from youth to adulthood,
from work to home, from the present to the future—shaping the society that people want to build.

CHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY 75
its budget to events and other promotions that reach its customers, rather than trying to use ad-
vertising to reach new customers.
In 1996 a governmental agency established a set of restrictions applicable to tobacco adver-
tisers. Among these were a ban on outdoor ads within 1,000 feet of a school or playground and a
rule that limited ads to black-and-white, text only, in magazines with 55 percent readership under
the age of 18. The restrictions also stipulated that $150 million be provided to fund anti-smoking
ads targeting children. Following the 1996 action, most states have received initial payments from
the $206 billion master settlement agreement to be supplied by tobacco companies over a 25-year
period. Approximately half the money goes to fund TVand print ads warning children about the
dangers of smoking; the other half pays for promotions such as loyalty cards, all-expenses-paid
teen summits, and various events. The anti-smoking truth® campaign aimed at teens was sup-
ported through these efforts.
Banning tobacco advertising is not unique to the United States. Many other countries have
even stronger restrictions against such advertising. A near-total advertising ban in the United
Kingdom took effect in early 2003, and similar restrictions were launched in the European Union
two years later. Canada and New Zealand have banned tobacco advertising, and Australia and
Malaysia have prohibited nearly all forms of it.
The ethics of advertising liquor is another concern. The biggest issue for the spirits industry
is charges of advertising to underage drinkers. In 2003 the FTC became so concerned that it asked
several major liquor producers to detail their marketing practices and target audiences and to ex-
plain how they had implemented the promises made in a 1999 report to Congress. About the same
time a lawsuit filed in the District of Columbia charged that alcohol marketers were actively en-
gaged in trying to establish brand loyalty among underage consumers.
Liquor executives contend that they follow voluntary advertising guidelines to avoid images
and time slots that appeal to kids. That stance has been hard to keep, however, because every ma-
jor brand is trying to win over young consumers.
The Distilled Spirits Council, a trade organization representing producers and marketers of
distilled spirits sold in the United States, offers a model for industry self-regulation. Its Code of
Responsible Practices for Beverage Alcohol Advertising and Marketing encourages members to
follow the guidelines set forth in the code when promoting their products.
For many years companies themselves and the four biggest networks—ABC, NBC, CBS,
and Fox—imposed a voluntary restriction on television advertising for liquor. However, in No-
vember 1996 the voluntary ban was dropped by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States,
after Seagram’s ran a commercial on an ABC affiliate. Commercials for distilled spirits are in-
creasingly visible on television.23
The beer industry has been the target of strong criticism for several years. Although it is un-
likely that beer advertising will be banned, some companies sensitive to public opinion have ini-
tiated proactive programs that educate and discourage underage drinkers.
Prescription drugs are another problem area. In 1997, the government loosened its controls
on pharmaceutical advertising. As a result, the amount of prescription drug advertising has sky-
rocketed. While these print and TVads have proven very successful in terms of increased sales,
various consumer groups, government agencies, and insurance companies have been quite criti-
cal of them. In one study, for example, the National Institute of Health Care Management found
that direct-to-consumer prescription advertising has led to an increase in requests for costlier
drugs, when the less expensive generic drug would be just as effective.24
Also, some doctors claim that they are being pressured to write inappropriate prescriptions
because their patients are influenced by the drug ad claims. Other doctors say they appreciate that
the advertising has caused consumers to become more active in managing their own health and
more informed about their drug options.

Emerging Issues One study surveyed industry leaders to see if they thought ethical issues
changed over time.26Their answer: Traditional ethical issues, such as the importance of being hon-
est and respectful in communication, are essentially the same, but different ones are emerging as
76 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL
a result of the changing digital media landscape. Industry leaders explained the risk of not telling
the truth was low in traditional media because so many checks and balances exist in the forms of
laws, guidelines, and other policing mechanisms. The checks and balances related to the Internet
and blogosphere, however, aren’t as well established, and a consensus about what constitutes eth-
ical behavior hasn’t fully developed for the Web.
Also marketers’loss of control over their messages, transparency, and privacy on the Inter-
net are key factors relating to ethical practices. The leaders noted the difficulty and complexity
related to developing regulation and controls for digital media practices like blogola and paid vi-
ral marketing. Photographers complain when their images are taken from sites like Flickr and
used in ads without their permission. It’s particularly a problem with user-generated ads.
Social Responsibility,Branding,and Integrity There is even an IMC dimension to social respon-
sibility. Cause marketing,which is marketing that supports a good cause such as Habitat for Hu-
manity, is a common practice for many companies. Companies can send employee teams to work
on food banks or homeless shelters, or the company can donate money or sponsor fund-raisers—
but those efforts are often short term.
On a higher level of social responsibility is the use of mission marketing,which refers to
marketing that aligns the basic business practices and position of a brand with some cause such
as the environment or sustainability. This practice adds value to a brand and leads to a positive
brand perception, as well as brand loyalty and stakeholder commitment. Ben & Jerry’s, Tom’s of
Maine, and the Body Shop are all supporters of good environmental practices in sourcing their
ingredients. Starbucks has become a supporter of ethically grown and traded coffee beans through
its “Shared Planet” program. In other words, it’s more than a short-term support of a cause—these
commitments are deeply embedded in the essence and operations of the brand and they lead to a
more passionate brand loyalty from all their stakeholders.
Mission marketing demonstrates our Fourth Principle of IMC:Integration equals integrity.

integrity. Abrand with integrity is driven by a singular vision and that can, and should, include
good citizenship.
Green marketing,for example, is more than just an advertising theme that resonates as con-
sumers become concerned about questions of global warming. It can also drive business decisions
and impact product design and packaging for everything from diapers to cars to plastic water bot-
tles. Companies concerned with this issue calculate the pollution created by their products—in
manufacturing, use, and disposal. Walmart, for example, announced in 2009 that it would provide
environmental impact information for all of its products.27
WHAT ARE COMMUNICATORS’ ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES?
Bynowyouarefamiliarwithmanyoftheethicalandsocialissuesfacingmarketingcommu-

what we mean by ethics and provide some decision-making tools as you encounter ethical
dilemmas. Let’s start by considering a Benetton campaign that challenged personal and pro-
fessionalethics.
Ethicsare the “shoulds” and “oughts” of behavior. Ethics are the “right thing to do.” Defin-
ing what is right can be challenging. What one person says is right isn’t always what others define
to be appropriate. Ethics and morals are closely related, but they are not synonymous. Moralsare
frameworks for right actions and are more the domain of religion and philosophy. Examples of
moral systems are the Ten Commandments from the Judeo-Christian religious tradition or the
Buddhists’Eightfold Path. These moral systems provide a framework for behavior.
Although ethics reflect what is right and wrong, the difficulty lies in making choices from
equally compelling or competing options, as in the Benetton example—how should you behave
when the answer is unclear? We know that doing the right thing is ethical, but it’s sometimes hard
to know what the right thing is. Sometimes there’s no one right answer. Consider, for example,
this situation: You are a graphic designer. You want to use a picture you found on the Internet, and

Personal and Professional Ethics
Ethical decisions are usually complex and involve navigating a moral maze of conflicting forces:
strategy versus ethics, costs versus ethics, effectiveness versus ethics, etc. They demand the abil-
ity to do what ethicists call “moral reasoning.”28In the end, if you are a responsible professional
making a decision about a strategy or an execution tactic to be used in an advertisement, you must
be aware of industry standards as well as ethical questions that underlie the core issues we have
discussed in this chapter.

Professionals in advertising by and large see themselves as ethical people. However, polls
indicate that the public tends to see them differently. In a recent Honesty and Ethics Poll con-
ducted by the Gallup organization, advertising practitioners ranked near the bottom, with nurses,
doctors and pharmacists at the top.29Advertising practitioners ranked ahead of HMO managers
and car salesmen. (Interestingly, members of Congress and Senators ranked lower than advertis-
ers.) That poll suggests the public is not persuaded that advertising professionals are guided by

Many professions write a code of ethics to help guide practitioners toward ethical behavior.
Advertising is no different. Professional ethics are often expressed in a code of standards that
identifies how professionals in the industry should respond when faced with ethical questions.

In the wake of highly public business scandals such as the collapse of Enron in 2001, many
firms are responding with their own codes of ethics. If this subject interests you, you can look up
these codes in a collection compiled by the Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions at
the Illinois Institute of Technology (http://ethics.iit.edu/codes/).
International Standards and Codes
Standards of professional behavior are not found only in the United States or other Western coun-
tries. Singapore, for example, has an ad code specifically designed to prevent Western-influenced
advertising from impairing Asian family values. Malaysia’s requirement that all ads be produced
in the country not only keeps that country’s advertising aligned with its own standards and cultural
values, it also cuts back dramatically on the number of foreign ads seen by its public. Advertisers
who violate the ethical code of conduct in Brazil can be fined up to $500,000 or imprisoned for up
to five years. This punishment would certainly prompt an advertiser to be careful.
In the Netherlands, industry members have encouraged the formation of an “ethical office”
to oversee all agencies, advertisers, and media. That office is responsible for reviewing adver-
tisements to ensure that they comply with the Dutch Advertising Code and general ethical prin-
ciples. In Swedish advertising agencies, an executive known as the “responsible editor” is trained
and experienced in marketing law; that editor reviews all advertisements and promotional mate-
rials to ensure that they are legally and ethically acceptable.
Ethical Decision-Making Tools
Codes of ethics can be helpful to guide your actions. However, they are broad statements and do
not explain what you should do in every circumstance you encounter. Developing a strong per-
sonal and professional sense of right and wrong is a prerequisite to being able to exercise re-
sponsible judgment when you’re confronted with an ethical dilemma. We include some tools that
you might find helpful. The Practical Tips box lists some questions that might prompt clearer
thinking about murky ethical problems.

One model that might guide you is the TARES Test of Ethical Advertising.30The five-part
test defines action-guiding principles directed toward making ethical decisions in the realm of
professional persuasion. The communication passes the test if it is truthful,authentic,respectful,
equitable and socially (TARES) responsible. These specific questions can guide your thinking:
1. Are the ad claims in the message Truthful? Are visual and verbal claims truthful?
Are omissions deceptive?
2. Is the claim an Authenticone? Is there a sincere need for the product? Are the reasons
given for purchasing the product genuinely appealing?
3. Does the ad treat the receiver with Respect? Does it include inaccurate stereotypes or de-
grading language?
4. Is there Equitybetween the sender and the receiver? Would the receiver of the ad need to
be unusually well informed or brilliant to understand the ad? Is some hidden prejudice
masked within the ad?
5. Is the ad Sociallyresponsible?
There are other models. Alternatively, you could use the Potter Box (see Figure 3.2), which asks
communication decision makers to consider four aspects of the dilemma. They need to (1) identify
and understand the facts,(2) outline the valuesinherent in the decision, (3) apply rele-
vant philosophical principles, and (4) articulate the competing loyalties. Using this
Facts Loyalties
model assumes you have some understanding of philosophical principles. None of these
Values Principles tools will give you a single, right answer. They will, however, help you examine the
problem from a number of angles and think systematically about the problem.

Key Advertising Legislation
• Pure Food and Drug Act (1906)Forbids the manufacture, sale, or transport of adulterated or
fraudulently labeled foods and drugs in interstate commerce. Supplanted by the Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act of 1938; amended by Food Additives Amendment in 1958 and
Kefauver-Harris Amendment in 1962.
• Federal Trade Commission Act (1914)Establishes the commission, a body of specialists
with broad powers to investigate and to issue cease-and-desist orders to enforce Section 5,
which declares that “unfair methods of competition in commerce are unlawful.”
• Wheeler-LeaAmendment(1938)Prohibitsunfairanddeceptiveactsandpracticesregardlessof
whethercompetitionisinjured;placesadvertisingoffoodsanddrugsunderFTCjurisdiction.
• Lanham Act (1947)Provides protection for trademarks (slogans and brand names) from
competitors and also encompasses false advertising.
• Magnuson-Moss Warranty/FTC Improvement Act (1975)Authorizes the FTC to determine
rules concerning consumer warranties and provides for consumer access to means of redress,
such as the “class action” suit. Also expands FTC regulatory powers over unfair or deceptive
acts or practices and allows it to require restitution for deceptively written warranties costing
the consumer more than $5.
• FTC Improvement Act (1980)Provides the House of Representatives and Senate jointly
with veto power over FTC regulation rules. Enacted to limit the FTC’s powers to regulate
“unfairness” issues in designing trade regulation rules on advertising.
82 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL
• The Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud Act and Abuse Protection Act (1994)Specifies
that telemarketers may not call anyone who requests not to be contacted. Resulted in the
Telemarketing Sales Rules.
In this section, we examine two pivotal areas of case law—trademarks and copyright pro-
tection and the First Amendment—as they pertain to advertising and other areas of marketing
communication.
Trademark and Copyright Protection Atrademarkis a brand, corporate or store name, or dis-
tinctive symbol that identifies the seller’s brand and thus differentiates it from the brands of other
sellers. Atrademark can be registered through the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) of the De-
partment of Commerce, which gives the organization exclusive use of the mark, as long as the
trademark is maintained as an identification of a specific product. Registered trademarks enjoy
more legal protection than those that are not registered. Under the Lanham Trademark Act of
1947, the PTO protects unique trademarks from infringement by competitors.
Even an audio trademark is protected, as a case in the European Union (EU) illustrates. A
distinctive audio sound based on the noise of a cock crowing and the way it was represented in
Dutch had been registered with the EU’s trademark office. When this sound trademark was used
by a different company, the first company sued for trademark infringement.
Arecent trademark issue is protection for uniform resource locators (URLs),which are In-
ternet domain names. URLs need to be registered to be protected just like any other trademark.
They are issued on a first-come, first-served basis for any domain name not identical to an exist-
ing brand name.
Acopyrightgives an organization the exclusive right to use or reproduce original work, such
as an advertisement or package design, for a specified period of time. The Library of Congress
controls copyright protection. Copyrighting of coined words, phrases, illustrations, characters,
and photographs can offer some protection from other advertisers who borrow too heavily from
competitors. Commonly used designs or symbols, however, cannot be copyrighted. Nor can ideas
be copyrighted. For a copyright to be obtained, a work must be fixed in a tangible medium. Copy-
right infringement can occur when a product is used in an ad without proper permission. Asweet
example: The maker of Peeps, those marshmallow chicks and bunnies, sued American Greetings
for using pictures of Peeps without authorization.31

Protection of advertising as commercial speech has varied over the years. In 1980, in con-
junction with its ruling on Central Hudson Gas and Electric v. Public Service Commission of New
York,the Supreme Court established a test that determines to what extent the government can re-
strict advertising. This decision also stipulated the degree to which advertising is considered com-
mercial speech, although a recent 2010 Supreme Court decision enhanced the free speech rights
of corporations, particularly for political speech.

The Supreme Court permits some restrictions on commercial speech. For example, the court
has held that false or misleading commercial speech can be banned. Even truthful commercial
speech can be restricted if the government can prove the public good demands such restrictions.32
The courts have also ruled that such acts as the federal ban on junk faxes is valid and that busi-
nesses’right to commercial speech does not include printing their advertisements on other peo-
ple’s fax machines.
CHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY 83
Essentially, the Supreme Court has ruled that only truthful commercial speech is protected,
not misleading or deceptive statements. Because the nation’s courts continue to reinterpret how
the First Amendment applies in different cases, advertisers need to keep close track of legal de-
velopments. The following list summarizes First Amendment decisions by the U.S. Supreme
Court that affect advertising:
First Amendment Rulings on Commercial Speech
• Valentine v. Chrestensen (1942)The Constitution protects free expression but not purely
commercial advertising. The Court seemed to be saying that advertising isn’t “speech” under
the First Amendment, and it’s questionable whether the Court actually intended the “purely
commercial” wording to have any real meaning.
• Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council (1976)States
cannot prohibit pharmacists from advertising prices of prescription drugs because the free
flow of information is indispensable.
• Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation v. Public Service Commission of New York
(1980)Public Service Commission’s prohibition of promotional advertising by utilities is
found to be unconstitutional, placing limitations on government regulation of unlawful, non-
deceptive advertising.
• Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Company of Puerto Rico (1986)Puerto Ri-
can law banned advertising of gambling casinos to residents of Puerto Rico. Asignificant
point in this case was Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Rehnquist’s comment that the
greater power of a legislature to ban gambling altogether most certainly included the lesser
power to ban only the advertising of gambling.
• Cincinnati v. Discovery Network (1993)The Court ruled that the Cincinnati City Council
violated the First Amendment’s protection of commercial speech when it banned news racks
of advertising brochures from city streets for aesthetic and safety reasons, while permitting
newspaper vending machines.
• Edenfield v. Fane (1993)The Court ruled that Florida’s prohibition of telephone solicitation
by accountants was unconstitutional.
• U.S. v. Edge Broadcasting (1993)Broadcasting gambling is a vice, so the legislature has the
greater power to ban it along with the lesser power to ban advertising of it.
• 44 Liquormart,Inc. v. Rhode Island (1996)The Court ruled that two Rhode Island statutes
that banned advertising for alcohol prices were unconstitutional.
• Glickman v. Wileman Bros. & Elliott,Inc. (1997)The Court ruled that a mandatory generic
advertising program, issued in accord with marketing orders of the Agricultural Marketing
Act, did not infringe on the free speech rights of fruit growers.
• New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964)The Court ruled that the First Amendment protects
criticism of the government that appeared in advertising even though it included some minor
factual errors.
• Rubin v. Coors Brewing (1995)The Court reaffirmed the regulation of commercial speech
when it ruled that Coors could publish the alcohol content on its label despite the Federal Al-
cohol Administration Act prohibition of doing so.
• Greater New Orleans Broadcasters Assn. v. U.S. (1999)The Court ruled that federal law
prohibits some, but not all broadcast advertising of lotteries and casino gambling.
• Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010)The Court ruled that government
may not ban political spending by corporations in candidate elections.
International Laws and Regulations As advertisers, agencies, and media become more global, it
will be imperative for the players to understand local laws in the countries in which they operate. Mar-
keting practices, such as pricing and price advertising, vary in their legal and regulatory restrictions.

There also are differences in the legal use of various marketing communication tools. Acon-
test or promotion might be successful in one country and illegal in another. Different laws and self-
regulatory codes about direct marketing exist in different European Union countries. For example,
France requires an opt-in clause to a mailing or questionnaire asking permission to add the cus-
tomer’s name to a mailing list.33Germany prohibits companies from making unsolicited telephone
calls and faxes to consumers. Because of the difficulty in complying with widely varying laws, in-
ternational advertisers often work with either local agencies or with international agencies that
have local affiliates and experts who know the local laws and can identify potential legal problems.
Marketing Regulatory Environment
In addition to specific legislation that affects the practice of marketing communication, there are
also government bodies that oversee the application of these laws and establish standards and reg-
ulations that marketers must meet. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the primary body that
oversees marketing communication, but a number of other agencies are also involved in regulat-
ing the messages sent to consumers, as summarized in the following list:
Specialized Government Agencies That Affect Advertising
Agency Effect on Advertising
Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov) Regulates credit, labeling, packaging,
warranties, and advertising.
Food and Drug Administration Regulates packaging, labeling, and
(www.fda.gov) manufacturing of food and drug products.
Federal Communications Commission Regulates radio and television stations and
(www.fcc.gov) networks.
U.S. Postal Service (www.usps.gov) Controls advertising by monitoring materials
sent through the mail.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division of the U.S. Treasury Department
(www.atf.treas.gov) that regulates advertising for alcoholic
beverages.
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Oversees trademark registration to protect
(www.uspto.gov) against patent infringement.
Library of Congress (www.loc.gov) Provides controls for copyright protection.
In addition to the FTC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Commu-
nications Commission (FCC) are dynamic components of the regulatory environment. Let’s
look in more depth at their missions and the type of practices they regulate.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Established by Congress in 1914 to oversee business, the
FTC is the primary agency governing the advertising industry. Its main focus with respect to ad-
vertising is to identify and eliminate ads that deceive or mislead the consumer. Some FTC re-
sponsibilities include the following:
• UnfairnessInitiate investigations against companies that engage in unfair competition or de-
ceptive practices.
• DeceptionRegulate acts and practices that deceive businesses or consumers and issue cease-
and-desist orders where such practices exist. Cease-and-desist orders require that the prac-
tice be stopped within 30 days; an order given to one firm is applicable to all firms in the
industry.
• ViolationsWhentheFTCfindsaviolationofthelaw,suchasadeceptiveorunfairprac-
tice,itmandates(1)acease-and-desistorder,(2)anaffirmativedisclosure,or(3)corrective

Specifically, the FTC oversees false advertising and in recent years that oversight has focused
on health and weight-loss business practices, 900 telephone numbers, telemarketing, and adver-
tising that targets children and the elderly. The FTC hosts the National Do Not Call Registry to help
CHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY 85
citizens keep from receiving unwanted telemarketing calls. The FTC monitors the ratings system
and the advertising practices of the film, music, and electronic games industries. Periodically, it is-
sues progress reports to Congress on youth-oriented entertainment advertising to make sure that
ads for products with potentially objectionable content—primarily violent or sexual content—are
not seen on media targeted to youth. The FTC’s reports to Congress cover advertising on televi-
sion and websites as well as print media.
The existence of a regulatory agency such as the FTC influences advertisers’behavior. Al-
though most cases never reach the FTC, advertisers prefer not to risk long legal battles with the
agency. Advertisers are also aware that competitors may complain to the FTC about a question-
able advertisement. Such a move can cost the offending organization millions of dollars.
The FTC revised its guidelines governing testimonial advertisements, bloggers, and
celebrity endorsements in October 2009 for the first time since 1980. These guidelines toughen
rules for endorsements and testimonials by requiring that the results touted by endorsers are likely
to be typical. The revisions also now cover bloggers who must disclose any free products or other
compensation they get in exchange for their endorsements.34
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) The FDAis the regulatory division of the U.S. Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services that oversees package labeling, ingredient listings, and ad-
vertising for food and drugs. It also determines the safety and purity of foods and cosmetics. In
particular, the FDAis a watchdog for drug advertising, specifically in the controversial area of
direct-to-consumer ads for prescription drugs. Its job is first to determine whether drugs are safe
and then to see that these drugs are marketed in a responsible way. Marketing includes promo-
tional materials aimed at doctors as well as consumers.
For pharmaceutical companies, advertising is a commercial free speech issue, and the in-
dustry has brought pressure on the FDAto make direct-to-consumer advertising rules for pre-
scription drugs more understandable, simpler, and clearer.
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) The FCC, formed in 1934 to protect the public
interest in broadcast communication, can issue and revoke licenses to radio and television sta-
tions. The FCC also has the power to ban messages, including ads, that are deceptive or in poor
taste. The agency monitors only advertisements that have been the subject of complaints and
works closely with the FTC to eliminate false and deceptive advertising. The FCC takes actions
against the media, whereas the FTC is concerned with advertisers and agencies.
Other Regulatory Bodies In addition to the FTC, the FDA, and the FCC, several other federal
agencies regulate advertising. Most other federal agencies that regulate advertising are limited to
a certain type of advertising, product, or medium. We have already discussed the Patent Office
and the Library of Congress and their roles in protecting copyrights and trademarks. Let’s now
look at other key regulatory agencies:
• Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco,and FirearmsThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and
Firearms (BATF) within the Treasury Department regulates deception in advertising and
establishes labeling requirements for the liquor industry. This agency’s power comes from
its authority to issue and revoke annual operating permits for distillers, wine merchants,
and brewers. Because there is a danger that public pressure could result in banning all ad-
vertisements for alcoholic beverages, the liquor industry strives to maintain tight controls
on its advertising.
• The U.S. Postal Service (USPS)The USPS regulates direct-mail and magazine advertising
and has control over the areas of obscenity, lotteries, and fraud. To give you an idea of the
magnitude of the U.S. Postal Service’s responsibility, the Direct Marketing Association esti-
mated spending on direct mail at $54 billion in 2008, even in a period of declining spending
on the medium.35Consumers who receive advertisements in the mail that they consider sex-
ually offensive can request that no more mail be delivered from that sender. The postmaster
general also has the power to withhold mail that promotes lotteries. Fraud can include a
number of questionable activities, such as implausible, get-rich-quick schemes.
• The States’Attorneys GeneralThe National Association of Attorneys General seeks to regu-
late advertising at the state level. Members of this organization have successfully brought
suits in their respective states against such advertising giants as Coca-Cola, Kraft, and
Campbell Soup. More recently, numerous attorneys general have led the way against the to-
bacco industry and have supported the advertising restrictions discussed earlier.
86 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL
The Impact of Regulation
In our discussion of issues we mentioned several that have spurred governmental regulation, such
as children’s advertising, deception, and claim substantiation.In this section we discuss these reg-
ulations in terms of the government agencies taking responsibility for them.
The FTC and Children’s Advertising Developing responsible advertising aimed at audiences of
children is a critical issue. The FTC and other governmental agencies have gotten involved with
the regulation of marketing to children.
After a 1978 study found that the average child viewed more than 20,000 TVcommercials
per year, a heated debate ensued. One side favored regulation because of children’s inability to
evaluate advertising messages and make purchasing decisions. The other side opposed regulation,
arguing that many self-regulatory mechanisms already existed and the proper place for restrict-
ing advertising to children was in the home.
In response, the FTC initiated proceedings to study possible regulations of children’s tele-
vision. Despite the FTC’s recommendations, the proceedings did not result in new federal regu-
lations until 1990. In the interim, self-regulation in the advertising industry tried to fill this void.
The National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc.,
set up a group charged with helping advertisers deal with children’s advertising in a manner sen-
sitive to children’s special needs. The Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU), established
in 1974, evaluates advertising directed at children under the age of 12.
In 1990 Congress passed the Children’s Television Advertising Practice Act, which placed
10.5-minute-per-hour ceilings for commercials in children’s weekend television programming
and 12-minute-per-hour limits for weekday programs. The act also set rules requiring that com-
mercial breaks be clearly distinguished from programming, barring the use of program characters
to promote products.
Advocates for children’s television continue to argue that many stations made little effort to
comply with the 1990 act and petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to increase
the required number of educational programs to be shown daily. In 1996, broadcasters, children’s
advocates, and the federal government reached an agreement requiring all TVstations to air three
hours of children’s educational shows a week.
Regulating Deception Ultimately, advertisers want their customers to trust their products and ad-
vertising, so many take precautions to ensure that their messages are not deceptive, misleading, or
unreasonable.Deceptive advertisingis intended to mislead consumers by making claims that are
false or by failure to make full disclosure of important facts, or both. The current FTC policy on
deception contains three basic elements:
1. MisleadingWhere there is representation, omission, or practice, there must be a probabil-
ity that it will mislead the consumer.
2. ReasonablenessThe perspective of the “reasonable consumer” is used to judge deception.
The FTC tests reasonableness by looking at whether the consumer’s interpretation or reac-
tion to an advertisement is reasonable.
3. InjuriousThe deception must hold the probability of material injury. Here, “material” is
defined as “affecting consumers’choice or behavior regarding the product or service.” In
other words, the deception is likely to influence consumers’decision making about prod-
ucts and services.
This policy makes deception difficult to prove because the criteria are rather vague and hard to
measure. It also creates uncertainty for advertisers who must wait for congressional hearings and
court cases to discover what the FTC will permit.

CHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY 87
The FTC determines the reasonableness of claims on a
case-by-case basis. In general, the FTC considers these factors:
• Type and Specificity of ClaimFor example, Computer
Tutor claims you can learn the basics of using a com-
puter by simply going through its three-CD set.
• Type of ProductFedEx promises a certain delivery time,
regardless of weather, mechanical breakdown, and so
forth. This product has a great many uncontrollable vari-
ables compared to Heinz ketchup, which the company
promises will be “thick.”
• Possible ConsequencesAwebsite that claims it is se-
cure can cause serious damage to its customers if, in
fact, it is not.
• Degree of RelianceBusiness-to-business customers de-
pend on the many claims made by their vendors. Therefore,
if XPEDX (yes, that’s how it’s spelled), a manufacturer of
boxes and other packages, claims in its ad that it can se-
curely deliver any size product, it had better deliver.
• Type and Accessibility of EvidenceThe type of evidence
could range from testimonials from satisfied customers to
complex product testing in multiple laboratories. It could be
made available through an 800-number request or online.
• What Substantiation is ReasonableWhat do experts in
this area believe is reasonable proof of a claim?
Remedies for Deception and Unfair Advertising Common
sources of complaints concerning deceptive or unfair adver-
tising practices are competitors, the public, and the FTC’s own monitors. After the FTC determines This ad claims the
that an ad is deceptive, the first step in the regulation process is to issue a consent decree.The FTC Chevy Equinox is the
most fuel efficient car
simply notifies the advertiser of its finding and asks the advertiser to sign a consent decree agree-
in its category. Note
ing to stop the deceptive practice. Most advertisers do sign the decree to avoid the bad publicity.

heavy-duty batteries. The ad didn’t mention Energizer by name, but Energizer charged the ad was
“false and misleading” because consumers would think the comparison was with other alkaline
batteries, such as Energizer. In fact, the CopperTop does not last longer than other alkaline bat-
teries. The ad was modified with a disclaimer.36
It is important for students of advertising to understand the legal ramifications of deceptive
and unfair advertising. Under some circumstances the FTC holds advertisers and their agencies
accountable. Essentially, an agency is liable for deceptive advertising along with the advertiser
when the agency is an active participant in the preparation of the ad and knows or has reason to
know that it is false or deceptive.
If a complaint seems justified, the commission can follow several courses of action:
• Cease-and-Desist OrdersWhen an advertiser refuses to sign a consent decree and the FTC
determines that the deception is substantial, it issues a cease-and-desist order.The process
leading to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order is similar to a court trial. An administra-
tive law judge presides. FTC staff attorneys represent the commission, and the accused par-
ties are entitled to representation by their lawyers. If the administrative judge decides in
favor of the FTC, the judge issues an order requiring the respondents to cease their unlawful
practices. The advertiser can appeal the order to the full five-member commission.
• Corrective AdvertisingThe FTC may require corrective advertisingwhen consumer re-
search determines that an advertising campaign has perpetuated lasting false beliefs. Under
this remedy, the FTC orders the offending person or organization to produce messages for
consumers that correct the false impressions the ad made. The purpose of corrective adver-
tising is not to punish an advertiser but to prevent it from continuing to deceive consumers.
The FTC may require a firm to run corrective advertising even if the campaign in question
has been discontinued.
88 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL
Alandmark corrective advertising case is Warner-Lambert v. FTC.According to the
FTC, Warner-Lambert’s campaign for Listerine mouthwash, which ran for 50 years, had
been deceiving customers, leading them to think that Listerine could prevent or reduce the
severity of sore throats and colds. The company was ordered to run a corrective advertising
campaign, mostly on television, for 16 months at a cost of $10 million.
Interestingly, after the Warner-Lambert corrective campaign ran its course, 42 percent
of Listerine users continued to believe that the mouthwash was being advertised as a remedy
for sore throats and colds, and 57 percent of users rated cold and sore throat effectiveness as
a key reason for purchasing the brand.37These results raised doubts about the effectiveness
of corrective advertising to change impressions and have affected recent court decisions.
• Consumer RedressThe Magnuson-Moss Warranty-FTC Improvement Act of 1975 empow-
ers the FTC to obtain consumer redress when a person or a firm engages in deceptive prac-
tices. Ajudge can order any of the following: cancellation or reformation of contracts,
refund of money or return of property, payment of damages, and public notification.
Media Review of Advertising
The media attempts to regulate advertising by screening and rejecting ads that violate their stan-
dards of truth and good taste. Most networks have a Standards and Practices Department that
screens every ad and gives approval before the ad can run. Each individual medium has the dis-
cretion to accept or reject a particular ad. For example, Reader’s Digestdoes not accept tobacco
and liquor ads, and many magazines and television stations do not show condom ads. The major
television networks craft their own standards and guidelines.
The First Amendment gives any publisher the right to refuse to publish anything the com-
pany does not want to publish, and this sometimes creates battles between media companies and
advertisers. For example, some billboard companies in Utah refused to run billboards for a
Wasatch Beer company brand named Polygamy Porter. The brand’s slogan “Why have just one!”
and headlines such as “Take Some Home for the Wives” were deemed offensive to the state’s
Mormon population. Asimilar brouhaha arose when the state’s Brighton Ski Resort promoted its
four-person lifts with a billboard during the Salt Lake City Olympics that read “Wife. Wife. Wife.
Husband.” The billboard company that banned the beer ads received letters both for and against
its stand, which indicates the difficulty of such decisions.
Self-Regulation
Rather than wait for laws and regulatory actions, responsible advertisers take the initiative and
establish individual ethical standards that anticipate and even go beyond possible complaints.
Such a proactive stance helps the creative process and avoids the kinds of disasters that result
from violating the law or offending members of society.
Advertisers practice three types of self-regulation: self-discipline, industry self-regulation,
and self-regulation by public and community groups.
Self-Discipline An organization such as an advertising agency exercises self-discipline when it
develops, uses, and enforces norms within its own practices. Self-discipline starts with the indi-
viduals in the agency or organization. It is each person’s responsibility to recognize ethical issues
and be intentional about their behavior. We hope that this chapter will help you think about mak-
ing choices that you deem the right thing to do in your career.

Several U.S. companies (Colgate-Palmolive, General Foods, AT&T) have their own codes
of behavior and criteria that determine whether advertisements are acceptable. Companies with-
out such codes tend to have informal criteria that they apply on an ad-by-ad basis. At a minimum,
advertisers and agencies should have every element of a proposed ad evaluated by an in-house
committee, lawyers, or both.
Industry Self-Regulation When the development, use, and enforcement of norms comes from the
industry, the term used is industry self-regulation.In the case of both advertisers and advertising agen-

cies, the most effective attempts at pure self-regulation have come through industry groups, such as
the Advertising Review Council (ARC) and the Better Business Bureau. In 1971 several professional
advertising associations in conjunction with the Council of Better Business Bureaus established the
National Advertising Review Council, which negotiates voluntary withdrawal of national advertis-
ing that professionals consider deceptive. The National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Council
of Better Business Bureaus and the National Advertising Review Board (NARB) are the two operat-
ing arms of the National Advertising Review Council. None of these are government agencies.
NAD is made up of people from the field of advertising. It evaluates complaints submitted
by consumers, consumer groups, industrial organizations, and advertising firms. NAD also does
its own industry monitoring. After NAD receives a complaint, it may ask the advertiser in ques-
tion to substantiate claims made in the advertisement. If that substantiation is deemed inadequate,
NAD representatives ask the advertiser to change or withdraw the offending ad. When a satis-
factory resolution cannot be found, NAD refers the case to NARB.

Self-Regulation by Public and Community Groups The advertising industry voluntarily in-
volves nonindustry representatives, such as the Better Business Bureau or the media, in the de-
velopment, application, and enforcement of norms. Local and consumer activist groups represent
two ways in which self-regulation occurs in this manner:
• Local GroupAt the local level, self-regulation has been supported by the Better Business
Bureau (BBB). The BBB (www.bbb.org) functions much like the national regulatory agen-
cies and also provides local businesses with advice concerning the legal aspects of adver-
tising. Approximately 250 local and national bureaus made up of advertisers, agencies,
and media, have screened hundreds of thousands of advertisements for possible violations
of truth and accuracy. Although the BBB has no legal power, it receives and investigates
complaints and maintains files on violators. It also assists local law enforcement officials
in prosecuting violators. The ease with which the BBB can be accessed on the Internet has
prompted businesses to be more careful about complying with its standards.
90 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL
• Consumer Activist GroupConsumer groups of all kinds monitor advertising practices. The
Action for Children’s Advertising group follows the practices of advertisers who market to
children and will file complaints with industry boards or regulatory agencies about adver-
tisements they consider questionable. The consumer group Public Citizen inspired the FDA
to require warnings on print ads for certain types of nicotine products. Groups that are fo-
cused on media literacy also review the performance of advertisers. For example, the Cul-
tural Environment Movement is a nonprofit coalition of independent organizations and
individuals that focuses on fairness, diversity, and justice in media communication.38
Looking Ahead
This chapter asked you to consider the social responsibility dimensions of advertising and mar-
keting communication in terms of ethics and regulation. The next section, Part II, will introduce
you to the basics of brand communication planning with chapters on how marketing communi-
cation works, the consumer audience, strategic research, and strategy and planning.
IT’S A WRAP
It’s a Winner, Just
Bee-Cause
As noted at the beginning of this chapter, the crisis of the honeybees is bigger than ice cream—it affects
a significant part of the food chain. The work Häagen-Dazs has done to illuminate the problem and work
toward a solution demonstrates that profits are only one measure of a brand’s success. Acting socially re-
sponsible is part of the formula for good business.
Christine Chen, deputy director of communication strategy at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, said the
campaign was successful in part because the honeybee issue was a natural fit with Häagen-Dazs. She said,
That [connection] made it more than just some cause we say we care about. It was something that
probably came as a surprise to consumers because it was a way they never really thought about the
brand before. The idea was to get people to think about the problem first and foremost and then to
understand Häagen-Dazs’s connection to it and become motivated to do something about it.
Although the bee crisis continues, more resources are focused on solving the mystery. Häagen-Dazs along
with other bee-involved brands such as Burt’s Bees were invited to testify before the House Agricultural Sub-
committee, and they successfully convinced congressional members to allocate funding for the CCD issue.
The investment in the problem paid good dividends for the brand as well. The honeybee buzz had a pos-
itive impact on sales. Unaided brand awareness of Häagen-Dazs rose from 29 to 36 percent. It generated lots
of publicity. It made 125 million impressions, which is the number of people who may have seen something
in the media about the crisis. This number of impressions had been set as the yearlong goal and was achieved
in quick order—during the campaign’s first week. The viral “Bee Dance” video on YouTube received more
than a million hits in the first month, proving once again, the power of the Internet.
”Häagen-Dazs Loves Honey Bees” won a swarm of awards for this campaign, including a Gold Effie; 2009
Festival of Media, Media Responsibility Award; Cannes Lions 2009 PR Lion; 2009 PRWeek Award for Cause-
Related Campaign of the Year; and the 2009 Silver SABRE (Superior Achievement in Branding and Reputa-
tion) Award.

PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE
TO THY BRAND
Part 1 introduced the basics of advertising and marketing practice. Part 2 focuses on how mar-
keting communication works, how consumers make decisions, and how strategy reflects the way
consumers think and feel.
No matter how much advertising and marketing communication change, a basic principle is
that brands should be true to themselves—and to the consumers who buy them. Regina Lewis,
vice president of consumer insights for the InterContinental Hotel Group, explains that principle
in her essay about the true nature of brand loyalty—how branding, which we introduced in
Chapter 2, intersects with consumers’feelings and self-images.
Consumers Are Not Loyal
to Brands . . . They Are Loyal
to Themselves
As I, along with my marketing and advertising agency colleagues, strive to reignite consumers’
emotional bond with the Holiday Inn power brand, I think back to a basic fact about consumers.
This is that consumers demonstrate loyalty to certain brands because those brands say some-
thing about them, as human beings, that they like.
Consumers who are loyal to Dunkin’Donuts, which is a down-to-earth, approach-
able brand, relish the fact that carrying a Dunkin’cup says to others that they, person-
ally, are down to earth and approachable.
Consumers who are loyal to Jeep Wrangler, which may symbolize an unconven-
tional attitude and a sense of adventure, love the fact that driving a Wrangler informs
others that they, too, are unconventional and adventurous.
When a brand fails to convey a soul or essence that matches personal characteristics
that consumers value, a brand lacks meaning; in the competitive marketplace, it blends in with
all other bland brands that lack charisma. On the other hand, when a brand becomes a badge that
consumers are proud of displaying, that brand becomes interwoven into consumers’everyday lives.
Holiday Inn is a power brand for many reasons. Perhaps most importantly, it is a brand that

Chapter 5 • Segmenting and Targeting the Audience
Chapter 6 • Strategic Research
Chapter 7 • Strategic Planning
As I, along with my marketing and advertising agency teams, ensure that Holiday Inn retains
its place in the hearts and minds of guests, I heed the following set of principles:
1. FeelBecause all human decisions involve some emotional component, no purely rational ad-
vertising approach can offer sustainable advantage. An advertisement must make folks “feel”
something!
2. ConnectAll advertising must not only contain an emotional component, it also must get that
emotion right. It must nail a way in which folks want to see either their world or themselves.
3. IdentifyWhile all consumers are individuals, we also can identify groups of consumers who
think and feel the same way; identifying and understanding these groups is at the root of strate-
gic planning.
4. UnderstandTo effectively deliver emotion through advertising, we must avoid “group think”;
sometimes, the most powerful idea can come from one consumer’s story . . . and the most
powerful message can be imagined by one brilliant creative mind that understands the minds
of the target audience.
5. SmileWhile economic times are tough at the time I am writing this essay, it is critical to re-
member that people want to feel happy! Just as songs that made people smile were celebrated
during the Great Depression, advertising that makes people smile will always be meaningful
when life feels difficult.
These principles will be explained further in the chapters that make up Part 2. Chapter 4an-
swers the big picture question of “How does advertising and other marketing communication
work?” Effectiveness factors are spelled out using the Facets Model of Effects. Building on that
discussion as a foundation, Chapter 5introduces the consumer audience and discusses how tar-
geting works. Chapter 6introduces the basics of research used to understand consumers and the
marketplace. Finally, Chapter 7explains that ideas about how advertising works, as well as how
consumers think and behave, come together in a strategic plan.

Ford in Sync with Hispanic Audience
We’re all experts on advertising, aren’t we? But have you ever stopped to
think about what makes some ads work and others seem ineffective? The
story behind Ford’s campaign for its new SYNC technology will give you
some insights about how effective advertising works.
Ford faced a significant challenge as it tried to convince potential consumers
of its small to medium-sized Focus and Edge vehicles that the vehicles had some
technological advantages. First, Ford is known for its tough, dependable trucks,
not as a technology leader. Consumers perceived competitors like Nissan Sentra,
Honda Civic, Scion, Toyota Corolla, and VW Rabbit or Jetta as being technologi-
cally superior. Second, not only did Ford need to overcome the perception that
foreign-made automobiles were more technologically advanced, it needed to
make the audience aware of its new innovation, which was practically invisible.
About all Ford had to show potential buyers was a button on the steering wheel
and a SYNC logo on the dashboard.
Before we get into a detailed analysis about how the advertising worked, let’s
look at Ford’s innovative technology. At the touch of a button or a simple voice
command, drivers could use Ford’s SYNC technology, developed by Microsoft, to
play music from their digital music players and to make phone calls. What differ-
entiates this technology from the competition is SYNC’s ability to understand var-
ious dialects of Spanish, which is particularly important to voice-activated
commands from a diverse U.S. Hispanic market. Ford knew that those who experi-
enced this system in demos and focus groups gave it rave reviews.
Wanting to capitalize on the SYNC technology, Ford sought a campaign tar-
geting the 18- to 49-year-old Hispanic market that would accomplish two objec-
tives: generate consumer awareness of SYNC by educating consumers, and get
hand-raisers (those who indicate interest by responding online) to register for
sweepstakes and to opt in for future Ford communications.
97
98 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND
Ford hired Zubi, an Hispanic agency, to create a campaign. Zubi recognized
that Ford needed to get the attention of its audience before it could accomplish
the goals of making people aware of this great new technology and persuading
them that they ought to own it. Here’s how they did it.
The campaign’s Big Idea centered on the notion that Ford’s SYNC—the ability
to control cell phones and MP3 players—was available at the driver’s command.
Audience research showed that members of the Hispanic target market are tech-
nologically savvy. They count on their MP3 players to help them during long com-
mutes. To successfully introduce SYNC in fuel-efficient Fords, the campaign
message needed to align the technology with consumers’ lifestyles in a fun way
that would grab their attention. The slogan, “SYNC: At Your Command” (SYNC: A
Tus Ordenes”), captured the heart of the message.

how marketing communication works is a foundation for discussions in the following chapters
on consumer behavior, consumer research, and strategic planning. It’s our view that you can’t
make intelligent decisions in those areas unless you have some understanding of how marketing
communication works.
In this chapter we’ll first consider advertising as communication. Then we’ll look at various
types of consumer responses to messages to identify the key effects, which we organize and pre-
sent as the Facets Model of Effects. This chapter, then, lays the groundwork for our explanation
of effectiveness, which is an important theme in this book.
DOES ADVERTISING WORK?
Would it surprise you to know that a lot of professionals, as well as academics, are really not sure
how advertising works—or even if it works well at all? This is even more of a problem for the
new digital media and other forms of marketing communication.
This classic quote attributed to Philadelphia department store baron John Wanamaker in the
early 1900s sums up the issue: “I know half my advertising is wasted, but I don’t know which
half.” (You can find his quotes and others about the impact of advertising on the Advertising Hall
of Fame website, www.advertisinghalloffame.org/members.)
Wanamaker is more positive than some advertising experts. The chairman of a British pro-
motions company estimated that only about 1 percent of the average campaign spending actually
works because few people are aware of ad messages, and of those who are aware, few actually
do anything in response.1Research by retired Syracuse University professor John Philip Jones,
who worked for many years at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, led him to conclude
that only 41 percent of advertising actually works in terms of producing sales.2
Of course, many professionals, including the managers of big global brands and big adver-
tising agencies, absolutely believe that advertising works both in the short term to create sales and
in the long term to build brands. After all, advertising is an $80 billion industry3—even larger
when you consider all of the various related areas of marketing communication.

HOW DOES MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORK?
Advertising and other forms of marketing communication are first of all a form of communica-
tion, messages that are designed to have some type of impact. In a sense, effective advertising is
a message to a consumer about a brand. It gets attention and provides information, sometimes
even a bit of entertainment as the Ford SYNC campaign demonstrated. It is purposeful in that it
seeks to create some kind of response, such as an inquiry, a sale, a visit to a website, or in the case
of Ford’s SYNC, a test drive.
The legendary David Ogilvy would like to see advertising as relevant as a personal conver-
sation.4He pretends he is at a dinner party and the woman next to him asks for advice. He ex-
plains, “I give her the facts, facts, facts. I try to make it interesting, fascinating, if possible, and
personal—I don’t write to the crowd.”
In reality, however, most traditional advertising is not as personal or as interactive as a con-
versation because it relies on mass communication. Although other forms of marketing commu-
nication, such as personal selling and telemarketing, can deliver the personal contact of a
conversation, Ogilvy’s comparison ignores the challenge of getting the attention of a largely dis-
interested audience when using mass communication. So let’s look first at how communication
works in general and then we’ll apply that analysis to mass media advertising and finally to the
broader arena of brand communication.
*Note: It’s simpler to just say “advertising,” but in this chapter we are referring to advertising as well as the more gen-
eral area of marketing communication.

Mass communication is a process, as depicted in the model in Figure 4.1a, which outlines the im-
portant players and steps. The SMCR modeldiagrams how mass communication works: It be-
gins with a source(S), a sender who encodes a message(M), or puts it in words and pictures. The
message is presented through channels of communication (C), such as a newspaper, radio, or
TV. The message is decoded, or interpreted, by the receiver(R), who is the reader, viewer, or lis-
tener. Feedbackis obtained by monitoring the response of the receiver to the message. The en-
tire process is complicated by what we refer to as noise, things that interrupt the sending and
receiving of the message, such as a bad connection or words with unclear meanings.
Advertising as Mass Communication
To translate the SMCR model to advertising using the Ford SYNC example, consider that the source
typically is the advertiser (Ford) assisted by its agency (Zubi) who encodes the information—that
is, advertising professionals turn the marketer’s information (voice-recognition technology) into an
interesting and attention-getting message (SYNC: At Your Command—a message delivered
through music by spokesperson Juanes). Together they determine the objectivesfor the message—
an advertisement or campaign—in terms of the effects they want the message to have on the
consumer audience(receiver).If the communication process fails to work and the consumer does
not receive the message as intended by the advertiser, then the communication effort is ineffective.
The advertising communication model shown in Figure 4.1b describes how this communication
process works.

CHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 101
Themessage,of course, is the advertisement or other marketing communication, such as a press
release, store banner, brochure, video, or Web page. The message may be spelled out in the words,
but in most advertising the visual elements also carry meaning. In fact, some advertising messages,
such as the 1984 commercial for the Macintosh discussed in Chapter 1, are primarily visual.
Themedium(channel) is the vehicle that delivers the message (TVcommercials, website,
flyers, Twitter tweets, events, in-store displays). In advertising, that tends to be newspapers and
magazines in print, radio and TVin broadcasting, the Internet, and other forms of out-of-home
vehicles, such as outdoor boards and posters. Other media include the phone, fax, specialty items
(mugs, T-shirts), in-store signs, brochures, catalogs, shopping bags, inflatables, even sidewalks
and toilet doors. The latest entry in the medium of marketing communication is the cell phone,
which has become a major personal communication technology. With instant messaging,
podcasting,movie downloads, photo transmission, Web surfing and tweeting, the cell phone is
the newest “must-have” communication device.
External noise,which hinders the consumer’s reception of the message, includes technical
and socioeconomic trends that affect the reception of the message, like the economic downturn.
Health trends, for example, often harm the reception of fast-food messages. Problems with the
brand’s marketing mix (product design, price, distribution, and marketing communication) can
also have an impact on the consumer’s response.
External noise can also be related to the advertising media. It can be as simple as bad broad-
cast or cell phone reception. Amore likely cause of noise is clutter,which is the multitude of mes-
sages all competing to get consumers’ attention. More specifically, clutter is all the ads in a
magazine or newspaper, or all the commercials you see on television when watching a program
or listening to your favorite radio station. It can even include any of the 3,000 or so commercial
messages you see in your daily environment, such as outdoor boards and brand names on T-shirts,
as well as in unexpected places, such as painted messages on sidewalks.
Internal noiseincludes personal factors that affect the reception of an advertisement, such
as the receiver’s needs, language skills, purchase history, information-processing abilities, and
other personal factors. If you are too tired to listen or your attention is focused elsewhere, then
your fatigue or disinterest creates noise that hinders your reception of the message. Distraction
from competing brand messages can also create internal noise, such as doubt or confusion.
Feedbackis the reaction the audience has to a message. It can be obtained through research
or through customer-initiated contact with the company, which are important tests of the effec-
tiveness of marketing communication messages.
The end point of the communication process is the receiver,or in advertising terms the con-
sumers who make up the audience. How the consumer responds to the message determines the
effectiveness of the advertising. Consumer response is the focus of the rest of this chapter.
Areally important thing to remember is that this process is not foolproof or even depend-
able. You can’t be sure the receiver will understand and interpret your message as you intended.
Remember the childhood “telephone” game where you stand in a circle and whisper a message
from person to person—and the last message rarely comes out sounding like the initial message.
That’s why feedback research is so important in marketing communication.
Adding Interaction to Marketing Communication
Mass communication is traditionally seen as a one-way communicationprocess with the message
depicted, as in Figures 4.1aand b, as moving from the source to the receiver—from an advertiser
to a target audience. However, interactive communicationsuch as Ogilvy’s idea of advertising
as personal conversation, is two-way communication—a dialogue or conversation—and market-
ing communication is moving in that direction. The difference between one-way and two-way
communication is that two-way communication,is interactive, and the source and receiver change
positions as the message bounces back and forth between them (think ping-pong)—the source be-
comes the listener and the receiver becomes the sender. Figure 4.2is a model of how two-way
communication works.
The interest in buzz marketingis an indication of an important trend in marketing commu-
nication strategy that is moving beyond two-way communication. In social marketing there are
multiple conversations occurring in the network. In terms of the old notion of source and receiver,
interactive communication means people are contacting companies through the Web or by phone,
102 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND

An Interactive Communication Model
The basic communication model is modified here to show how interactive communication works as a conversation or dialogue. Note how the source and
receiver change positions as the message bounces back and forth between them.
and they are talking to one another in a circle of comments about products and brands. As one ex-
pert in interactive telecommunication explained, “We’re living through the largest expansion of
expressive capability in the history of the human race.”5Inevitably, that means advertising must
change to also become more interactive.
Interactivity is important because, in addition to a purchase, consumers today can react to a
marketing communication message in many other ways: by responding with comments, phone
calls, and e-mail inquiries to sales personnel and customer service. They initiate communication,
as well as receive it. If advertisers want to overcome the impersonal nature of mass communica-
tion, they need to learn to receive (i.e., listen to) as well as send messages to customers.
Permission marketingreflects this desire for more interactive and sensitive communication. The
idea behind permission marketing is that you ask people if it is okay to contact them or you rely
on them to contact you first in order to open the door for follow-up conversation.

More than capturing feedback, some companies are designing programs specifically to so-
licit ideas from customers and even get them involved in product design using their own web-
sites, blogs, Facebook, and even Twitter. UserVoice is a San Francisco–based company that sets
up forums on clients’websites that encourage customers to contribute and vote on ideas.6(Check

Two-way communication is one of the objectives of an integrated marketing communication
(IMC)-focused program because it helps create long-term customer relationships with a brand.
The growth of permission marketing,a practice that invites consumers to sign up for messages or
self-select themselves into a brand’s target market, mirrors the shift from one-way to two-way
communication. It’s a way to build a respectful relationship with a customer.
WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS BEHIND EFFECTIVENESS?
What are the effects that make an advertisement effective? Consider your favorite commercials—
do they grip you emotionally? (Think Hallmark and Dove soap.) Do they have a compelling
message? (The “1984” commercial we introduced in Chapter 1is a good example.) How about
learning something—do you think about things because of something you heard or read in an ad?

Traditional Approaches
When we ask how it works, we are talking about the impactcommunication has on receivers of
the message—that is, how they respond to the message. What are the effects that determine
whether an advertisement works or not? Over the years, professionals have used several models
to outline what they believe is the impact of an advertisement on its audience:8
• AIDAThe most commonly used explanation of how advertising works is referred to as
AIDA,which stands for attention,interest,desire, and action. This concept was first ex-
pressed around 1900 by an advertising pioneer named St. Elmo Lewis. Because AIDAas-
sumes a predictable set of steps, it also is referred to as a hierarchy of effectsmodel.
Numerous other hierarchical models have been developed over the years to help advertisers
plan their advertising.9
• Think/Feel/DoAnother relatively simple answer to how advertising works is the think/feel/do
modeldeveloped in the 1970s. Also referred to as the FCB modelin honor of the agency
where it was developed as a strategic planning tool, the idea is that advertising motivates peo-
ple to think about the message, feel something about the brand, and then do something, such as
try it or buy it.10That view is supported by recent research by Nyilasy and Reid into what pro-
fessionals in advertising know and believe about how advertising works. Their in-depth inter-
views found that “agency practitioners strongly believe that exposure to ads causes changes in
human cognition, emotions, and behavior”—or think/feel/do.11
• DomainsAdifferent approach that attempted to solve the problem of linear steps is found in
Moriarty’s domains model. It is based on the idea that messages have an impact on con-
sumer responses, not in steps, but simultaneously. The three key effects, or domains, identi-
fied in this approach are (1) perception, (2) learning, and (3) persuasion. The idea is that a
message can engage consumers’perceptions (attention, interest), educate them (think, learn),
and persuade them (change attitude and behavior) all at the same time.12The Port of Van-
couver ads are an example of how these effects interact. Even though the ads are in the
business-to-business (B2B) category, the ads get the attention of their audience with dra-
matic headlines and visuals: “We have room to fulfill your vision” and the “Vacancy” sign,
for example. The “Vacancy” ad is an educational message as the rest of the headline explains
(“858 acres to be exact”), but also persuasive in that it makes the argument that the Port of
Vancouver has room to grow and provide space to meet the needs of its customers.
How do we make sense of all of these ideas about how advertising works in order to create
a reasonable approach to use in planning and critiquing advertising? One goal of this book is to
organize all of these effects so they are useful for setting objectives and, ultimately, evaluating ef-
fectiveness. But how to do it? That’s the question at the heart of this chapter and we’ll answer
with our model of how advertising and marketing communication work, a model that we think
you will find to be simple and easy to use in explaining the impact of a message.
What Effects Are Critical?
Advertising professionals learn from their experiences producing marketing communication that
works—and sometimes doesn’t work very well. The practitioners interviewed by Nyilasy and
Reid identified four building blocks as essential to effective advertising. They are attention, brand
awareness, attitudes, and behavioral responses.13
Attitudes are both rational and emotional. The rational element is confirmed by David Ogilvy,
who says in his classic little book, Confessions of an Advertising Man,“Very few advertisements
contain enough factual information to sell the product.” He was also quoted on the Advertising Hall
of Fame website as saying that it needs to be informative to be persuasive.14

CHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 105
Ogilvy’s advice comes from the traditional school that prizes ra-
tional decision making. Information and rational information processing
are definitely important to certain types of ads. Consider, for example,
the Canadian government’s new Citizenship Act, which is designed to
restore citizenship to thousands of unsuspecting foreigners, many of
them Americans, who were forced to renounce their Canadian citizen-
ship when they became citizens of another country. Canada uses ads on
YouTube titled “Waking Up Canadian” to explain the situation.15
(Check them out at www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDeDQpIQFD0)
Ogilvy’s views and most of the traditional models, however, leave
out a very critical factor that helps explain how advertising works and
that is emotion,which Nyilasy and Reid’s practitioners believe is just
as important as information in the formation of attitudes. Some experts
even believe emotion is more important than logical thinking in con-
sumer decision making.
Ogilvy also recognizes persuasion as an important function and
Nyilasy and Reid’s professionals point to attitudes as critical—attitude
formation and change being an important result of persuasive communi-
cation. (For other quotes and insights into how advertising works—or
should work—visit www.advertisinghalloffame .org/members.)
The traditional approaches to defining the effects of advertising
pose two problems: (1) the presumption of a set of steps as a
predictable pattern of response—as in the old hierarchy of effects
models—and (2) missing effects. The problem with the step-based (hi-
erarchical and linear) models is that advertisers now realize people
don’t always respond in such a predictable fashion. This was confirmed
by the opinions of the practitioners interviewed by Nyilasy and Reid
who insist that “effects beyond getting attention can occur in any order,
or even simultaneously.”16
Ogilvy’s focus on persuasion illustrates the problem that effects
models don’t always cover the essential facets of marketing communica-
tion impact. This problem is also particularly apparent when we look at
research techniques used to evaluate effectiveness. Consider, for exam-
ple, that the model of television advertising the Ameritest research company (www.Ameritest.net) An unsuspecting but

image and identity. And guiding actions,both big and small,that deliver on that brand
promise. To every audience that brand has. At every brand intersection point. At all times.
WHAT ARE THE FACETS OF IMPACT?
Our objective in this chapter is to present our Facets Model of Effects that does a more complete
job than previous models of explaining how advertising creates impact in terms of various types
of consumer responses. Ultimately, we are guided by the kind of thinking that Regina Lewis
106 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND
expressed in the Part 2 opener: that consumers are loyal to brands that say something about them
as human beings. Effective marketing communication speaks to us about things that we want to
know in ways that we like.
The simplicity of think/feel/do makes it a good starting point, since all three of these effects
are generally recognized as critical consumer responses to advertising. Several of the models be-
gin with terms like attention, awareness, and exposure, concepts that recognize there is a
perceptual dimension to advertising impact, as Moriarty’s domains model suggests. Another
missing area we’ve noted is persuasion,which explains how beliefs and attitudes are created or
changed and conviction is established. Since persuasion relies on both think and feel responses,
it doesn’t fit at all in the hierarchical models and falls between the cracks if you are trying to use
the think/feel/do approach as a model for objectives. Another of the areas missing from most
models is association, which Preston and Thorson use to explain how brand communication
works in general.20In recognition of its importance to brand communication, this category is also
calledbrand transformationorbrand linkage.
The solution, then, to our search for a new model is to build on the effects identified in the
think/feel/do approach and add the missing categories. It is interesting that the missing areas we
just identified—perception, brand association, and persuasion—are also related to the three areas
that the Ameritest research company uses in evaluating effective commercials.
Thus, we propose a six-factor model that should be useful both in setting objectives and eval-
uating the effectiveness of advertising. Our answer to the question of how advertising works is to
propose that effective advertising creates six types of consumer responses: (1) see/hear, (2) feel,
(3) think/understand, (4) connect, (5) believe, and (6) act/do—all of which work together to cre-
ate the response to a brand message. These six consumer responses and the categories of effects
to which they belong are represented in Figure 4.3.
Think, of these six effects as facets—polished surfaces like those of a diamond or crystal—
that come together to make up a unique consumer response to an advertising message. The ef-
fects are holistic in the sense that they lead to an impression, or what Preston calls an “integrated
perception.”21An effective message has a diamond-like quality that represents how the message
effects work together to create the desired consumer response. The effects can vary in importance
with some advertising campaigns more focused on one or several of the facets.

Here is a table to help you analyze the impact of an advertisement in terms of the type of ob-
jective the ad is trying to achieve and how that will be apparent in the way consumers respond to
the message. The final column lists factors that can be measured to determine if you achieved the
desired type of impact.

Let’s now explore these six categories of effects in more detail. We’ll start with perception,
which is where the consumer response to an advertisement begins.
The Perception Facet: See/Hear
Every day we are bombarded with stimuli—faces, conversations, scents, sounds, advertisements,
news announcements—yet we actually notice only a small fraction of those stimuli. Why?
The answer is perception. Perceptionis the process by which we receive information through Principle
our five senses and assign meaning to it. If an advertisement is to be effective, first of all, it must For an advertisement to
get noticed. It has to be seen or heard, even if the perception is minimal and largely below the level be effective, it first has to
of awareness. We “see” ads in magazines even if we page through the publication without stop- get noticed or at least
ping to read them; we “see” commercials on TVeven as we zip through a recorded program. The register on some minimal
challenge is to create breakthrough advertising, messages that get attention and stick in the mind. level on our senses.
Our minds are full of impressions that we have collected without much active thought or
concentration. Of course, on occasion we do stop and read an ad or watch a commercial all the
way through, so there are various degrees and levels of perception. The Burger King “Freakout”
ads were particularly effective at breaking through inattention and building awareness. Break-
through advertising, then, is advertising that breaks through the perceptual filters and makes an
impression on the audience.
Factors That Drive the Perception Response Consumers select messages to which they pay at-
tention, a process called selective perception.Here’s how perception works: Some ads for some
product categories—personal hygiene products, for example—battle for attention because peo-
ple don’t choose to watch them. However, if the message breaks through the disinterest and is se-
lected and attended to, then the consumer may react to it with interest if it is relevant. The result
is awareness of the ad or brand, which is filed in memory at least to the point that the consumer
recognizes the brand or ad.
The key factors driving perception, then, are exposure, selection and attention, interest, rel-
evance, curiosity, awareness, and recognition. Here is a brief review of these terms and how they
relate to advertising impact:
• ExposureThe first test of perception is whether a marketing communication message is
seen or heard. In advertising, this is called exposure,which is an important goal of media
planners who try to find the best way to reach consumers with a message.
108 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND
• Selection and AttentionThe next factor that drives perception is selective attention,the
process by which a receiver of a message chooses to attend to a message. Amid all the clut-
ter in the media environment, selection is a huge problem. The ability to draw attention that
brings visibility to a brand is one of advertising’s greatest strengths. Advertisements, particu-
larly television commercials, are often designed to be intrusive,which means they intrude
on people’s perception in order to grab attention.
• InterestAfactor in crossing the selection barrier is interest,which means the receiver of the
message has become mentally engaged in some way with the ad and the product. Ad mes-
sages are designed not only to get attention, but also to hold the audience’s interest long
enough for the audience to register the point of the ad. That level of interest and attention is
sometimes referred to as stickiness, particularly for websites.
• RelevanceOne reason people are interested in something is relevance,which means the
message, such as the accompanying example for the Peace Corps, connects on some per-
sonal level. The Peace Corps launched a national recruiting campaign with the theme “Life
is calling. How far will you go?” It was designed to address more relevant personal issues
for potential volunteers and tell them how the volunteer experience would enrich their lives.
• CuriosityAnother reason people pay attention is curiosity,which results from questioning,
wanting to know more, or being intrigued by something. Curiosity also may be a problem
for certain types of campaigns, such as antidrug and anti-smoking efforts, as Ohio Univer-
sity Professor Carson B. Wagner found out in his research on the government’s “Just Say
No” campaign. He explains:
One weekend, my father, who is an advertis-
ing executive, and I got into a conversation
about how it seemed every time a news story
aired about illicit drugs, a small epidemic of
drug use would ensue. Of course, there’s
been a lot of research done about the ways
media can encourage drug use, but most of
that is about popular media such as movies
and music. We’d presume that news pro-
grams and antidrug ads that are meant to
show illicit drugs in a negative light
shouldn’t lead people toward drugs. But, as
almost any student of communication has
learned, media don’t tell us what to think;
they tell us what to think about.
So, I decided to test the idea on antidrug
ads—the most counterintuitive possibility—
in a small experiment for my master’s thesis. I
scouredprior research, but I couldn’t find
anything suggesting that antidrug ads might
lead to drug use. Almost all studies showed
that drug attitudes became more negative.
But, the psychology-of-curiosity literature
suggested something else: If antidrug ads
make people think drug use is widespread,
they might become curious about experiment-
ing themselves. My study found that the cu-
riosity literature was correct.
Wagner’s counterintuitive results were so
compelling that he found himself on talk shows
and featured in news and wire stories. He also pre-
sented his findings to Congress. Since then, a large-
scale government-sponsored survey examining the
Messages that are relevant speak to a consumer’s special first five years of the government’s “Just Say No”
interests. campaign uncovered similar relationships between
CHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 109
antidrug advertising and drug use. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem to have gotten any better
reception than Wagner’s study did. It’s hard to convince some experts that even negative at-
tention is still attention.
• AwarenessWhen you are aware of something, you know that you have seen it or heard it
before. In other words, awarenessresults when an advertisement makes an impression—
when something registers. New product campaigns, for example, seek to create high levels
of brand awareness. Brand reminder ads on billboards and Web pages are also designed to
maintain a high level of awareness of familiar brands, as are logos on clothing.
• RecognitionAdvertisers are interested in two types of memory: recognitionwhich means
people remember seeing the ad, and recall,which means they remember what the ad said.
Recognition is a measure of perception and is used to determine awareness. Recall is a mea-
sure of understanding, which we will talk about in a later section on cognitive effects.
Recognition relies on simple visuals that lock into memory, such as logos (Nike’s swoosh),
as well as colors (IBM’s blue), jingles and sounds (Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” for
United Airlines), characters (the Energizer bunny), key visuals (Polo’s pony, the disbelieving
look of the Aflac duck), and slogans (Altoids, “The Curiously Strong Mints”). Memory de-
pends heavily on repetition to anchor an impression in the mind.

municated. That’s just how perception works. Sophisticated managers understand this and try to
manage their communication programs so all the messages work together to create Preston’s co-
herent brand perception.
The Subliminal Issue Before we leave the perception category, let’s consider the controversial
area of subliminal effects. subliminaleffects are message cues given below the threshold of per-
ception. In other words, they don’t register. As Professor Sheri Broyles explains in the A Matter
of Principle feature, “By definition, subliminal means the stimulus is below your threshold of
consciousness. The first thing to know is if you can see something, then it isn’t subliminal.” The
idea is that subliminal messages are designed to get past your perceptual filters by talking directly
to your subconscious. People who believe in subliminal advertising presume such messages to be
intense enough to influence behavior and they consider it to be unfair manipulation of unaware
viewers. Broyles describes the research and thinking about the idea that unseen messages can be
communicated in advertising in the A Matter of Principlefeature.

also notes that certain types of emotional messages have more resonance: “Nostalgic brands that
give people a sense of tradition and security tend to thrive.”
Feelings and emotions can be positive—or negative. Generally, marketing communication

Ice Cubes, Breasts, and Subliminal Ads
Sheri Broyles,Associate Professor, University of North Texas
For 50 years people have been
looking for secret little subliminal
messages carefully hidden in
advertising we see every day.
It began in 1957 in a movie
theater experiment when
James Vicary subliminally sug-
gested people “eat popcorn”
and “drink Coca-Cola” by project-
ing those words at 1/3,000th of a

News media at the time widely reported his claims that
sales of popcorn and soda increased as a result. Though
he later admitted these results were a hoax, it was as if
Pandora had let subliminal advertising out of her box. A
large majority of people have repeatedly said that they
have heard of subliminal advertising (74 to 84 percent),
they believe advertisers use this technique (68 to 85 per-
cent), and they think it is effective (68 to 78 percent).
Obviously, subliminal advertising continues to be an is-

inspire love for their brands.
Sometimes, however, a brand message arouses different emotions—fear or dislike, for ex-
ample. Some ads are designed to make you feel negative about something (smoking, bugs in your
home, a political candidate). In the case of irritating advertising, you may even respond by dis-
liking a brand or an ad, which may be a sign of a failed campaign. Have you ever seen an ad that
you positively disliked? How did that affect your attitude toward the brand?
Look back at the Facets Model of Effects in Figure 4.3. Notice how perceptionandfeelsit
side by side at the top of the model. Although this isn’t a linear process model, the perceptual
process begins with perception if a message registers at all. That also means emotion is a driving
factor because it is so closely related to perception. Erik du Plessis, the CEO of a global adver-
tising research firm, makes the argument in his book The Advertised Mindthat attention is driven
by emotion.23He says our emotional responses to a message determine whether or not we pay at-
tention. The key task of an ad, then, is initially to evoke an emotional response.
This view is supported by recent research in the neurosciences, which advertising professor
Ann Marie Barry says “acknowledges the primacy of emotions in processing all communica-
tion.”24She explains further that “Perception, the process by which we derive meaning from what
we see, is an elaborate symphony played first and foremost through the unconscious emotional sys-
tem.” The important role of emotion in directing perception also structures our responses to brand
messages, particularly those that engage us on a personal
level. For more on this subject, check out Barry’s comments
on thinking versus feeling in the A Matter of Practicefeature.
Factors That Drive the Emotional/Affective Response
Emotional responses are powerful, not only because they
drive perception, but also because, as du Plessis explains,
they determine whether our unconscious reaction becomes
conscious—in other words, the ad breaks through disinterest.
Furthermore, he suggests that positive emotional responses
drive memory as well.
The affective response drivers are wants and desires,
excitement, feelings, liking, and resonance. Emotion, then,
causes us to “feel” something. Another classic commercial
that has generated positive responses for more than 40 years
is the Coca-Cola “Hilltop” commercial, which shows a
multi-ethnic group of young people singing “I want to teach
the world to sing in perfect harmony.” Aproduct of the anti-
war, Peace Movement, Woodstock generation, the 1972
commercial touched nerves, as well as hearts, and continues
to get airtime, particularly on holidays. (Check it out at

• Wants and Desires“I want something” implies desire.
Wantsare driven by emotions and based on wishes,
longings, and cravings—such as teaching the world to
sing, which is a metaphor for peace. Impulse buying is a
good example of the motivational power of wants. When

• ExcitementAstep above interest in terms of intensity of response (see the perception dis-
cussion) is excitement,which means our emotions or passions are aroused. If we are excited
about something, we are agitated or energized and more willing to participate or make a
commitment.
• FeelingsOur passions and feelings are addressed in a number of ways in advertising, such
as humor, love, or fear. Ads that rely on arousing feelings are referred to as using emotional
appeals.The idea that emotional appeals may have more impact than rational approaches on
both attitudes and behavior was supported by a University of Florida study that analyzed
23,000 consumer responses and found that the emotional response is more powerful than
cognition in predicting action.25
CHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 113
• LikingTwo important affective responses to a message are liking the brand and liking the

that liking—both the brand and the ad—was the best predictor of consumer behavior.26 liking the brand.
On the opposite side of liking is aversion,which means people avoid buying a brand
because they don’t like the ads or what they associate with the brand. We don’t like to see
condom ads, so they aren’t often found in the mass media. Negative political ads demon-
strate the flip side of liking. They are an example of an affective strategy that seems to
work by putting opponents on the defensive. They may work through the power of sugges-
tion, but most people say they dislike these ads because they sometimes seem unfair or
mean spirited.
• ResonanceEffective advertisements sometimes create resonance,or a feeling that the mes-
sage “rings true.” Like relevance, messages that resonate help the consumer identify with the
brand on a personal level. Resonance is stronger than liking because it involves an element
of self-identification. These sympathetic vibes amplify the emotional impact by engaging a
consumer in a personal connection with a brand.
The Cognition Facet: Think/Understand
How many ads that you have seen on television or
noticed in print caused you to stop and think about
the brand? Can you recall any instance where
you learned something new about a product from
an ad? Have you ever seen an ad you liked and
then can’t remember the name of the advertiser?
Although perception and its partner, emotion, are
the first effects of an advertising message, an
advertisement may generate any of the other
responses—cognition, association, persuasion,
and behavior—next. For this discussion, we’ll
talk first about cognitive impact.
Cognition refers to how consumers search
for and respond to information, as well as how
they learn and understand something. It’s a ra-
tional response to a message. Some call this a left-
brain approach, based on the left–right brain ways
of thinking that evolved from brain hemisphere
research. Right-brain thinking is presumed to be
more emotional and creative. The American Air-
lines ad uses the left–right brain metaphor to
demonstrate the difference between a cognitive
and an emotional advertising message.

thatarecomplex(e.g.,appliances,cars,insurance,computers,software)orthatinvolveahighprice
orhighrisk(e.g.,motorboats,vacations,medicalprocedures).
The key drivers of a consumer’s cognitive response are need, cognitive learning, compre-
hension, differentiation, and recall.
• NeedAdvertisers talk a lot about consumer needs and wants. Generally, needsare basic bio-
logical motivations but they are also something you think about; wants tend to be based
more on feelings and desires. In other words, when we refer to needs, we are usually talking
about a message that describes something lacking in consumers’lives and that often stimu-
lates a cognitive response. Advertisers address consumer needs through informational ads
that explain how a product works and what it can do for the user—the benefits it offers to
the user. For example, consumers need a virus protection program for their personal comput-
ers, but they also may need an explanation of how the program works. Complicating our un-
derstanding of needs and wants is the impact of a major event, such as the recent recession.
AWall Street Journalarticle analyzed the auto industry in terms of the tug between want (a
Cadillac Escapade specially designed on GM’s website to a customer’s order) and need (a
used car that offers the best value in terms of miles and price) or a need that’s simply post-
poned because it’s of less significance that other more compelling needs.27
• Cognitive LearningConsumers learn about products and brands through two primary
routes: cognitive learning and conditioned learning. (We’ll talk about conditioned learning in
the section on association.) Cognitive learningoccurs when a presentation of facts, infor-
mation, and explanations leads to understanding. Consumers who are trying to find informa-
tion about a product before they buy it are taking the cognitive learning route. This typically
applies to large purchases, such as cars, computers, and major appliances. Learning is also a
part of new product introductions—in recent years, we have had to learn to use computers,
VCRs, the Internet, TiVo, and the iPod, and marketing communication is the key tool used
by marketers to teach prospective customers about these products and product innovations.
• ComprehensionComprehensionis the process by which people understand, make sense of
things, and acquire knowledge. Confusion,on the other hand, is the absence of understand-
ing and is usually the result of logic problems. For example, it’s difficult for consumers to
understand why an outdoor board for the gas-guzzling Hummer would use a green market-
ing strategy. The headline “Thirst for adventure. Not gas” suggests a gas-efficient Hummer
and the logic doesn’t follow from what people commonly know about this vehicle.
• DifferentiationDifferentiationis the consumer’s ability to separate one brand from another
in a product category. Distinguishing between competing brands is what happens when con-
sumers understand the explanation of a competitive advantage. In a historic but still impor-
tant study of effective television commercials, researchers concluded that one of the most
important effectiveness factors is a brand-differentiating message.28
• RecallWe mentioned earlier that recognition is a measure of perception and recall is a mea-
sure of learning or understanding. When you recall the ad message, you not only remember
seeing the ad and hopefully the brand, you also remember the copy points, or the informa-
tion provided about the brand. To recall information presented in the ad, however, you must
have concentrated on it and thought about it either as the information was being presented or
afterward. Thinking about it—similar to mentally rehearsing the key points—is a form of in-
formation processing that helps anchor ideas in memory and makes recall easier.
Even though this section is on cognitive processing, note that feeling and thinking work to-
gether. Psychologist and advertising professor Esther Thorson and her colleagues have developed

through symbolism. As such, it is the primary tool used in brand communication. It is the process
of learning to make symbolic connections between a brand and desirable characteristics and qual-
ities, as well as people, situations, and lifestyles that cue the brand’s image and personality.

ciation model of advertising, believes that you can explain how advertising works by under-
standingassociation.30
Factors That Drive the Association Response The goal of association is to use symbolic con-
nections to define the brand and make it distinctive. Brand linkagereflects the degree to which
the associations presented in the message, as well as the con-
sumer’s interest, are connected to the brand. For example, an
ad for Bisquick HeartSmart mix shows a pancake in the shape
of a heart. In this case, the brand name—Bisquick HeartS-
mart—is easily associated with the product use—your heart
and healthy pancakes. The association drivers we discuss here
are symbolism, conditioned learning, and transformation:
• SymbolismThrough association a brand takes on a
symbolic meaning,which means the brand stands for
certain qualities. It represents something, usually some-
thing abstract. Bisquick’s pancakes shaped like hearts
convey the heart-healthy message symbolically. The
Port of Vancouver B2B ads use symbolism to catch at-
tention and tell a story, such as the vacancy sign in the
ad analyzed earlier. Symbolism is also used in the other
ads, where one refers to cargo handling as shepherding
and the other references wind power both as a cargo and
as a source of movement for ships.
• Conditioned LearningAlthough advertisements some-
times use a cognitive strategy, they frequently are de-
signed to elicit noncognitive associations through
conditioned learning,the process by which a group of
thoughts and feelings becomes linked to the brand
through repetition of the message. Beer advertising di-
rected at a young male audience, for example, often uses
images of sporting events, beach parties, and good-looking
young women. People also learn by watching others,
which is called social learning.We learn about fashion by
watching how others dress and about manners by watch-
ing how other people interact. We connect their appear-
ance and manners to certain situations reflected in the ads.
• TransformationThe result of the brand association
process is transformation. Transformation,as originally
explained by former DDB research director Bill Wells, is
what happens when a product takes on meaning and is
transformed from a mere product into something special. It
becomes differentiated from other products in the category
by virtue of its brand image symbolism and personality
cues. Bisquick HeartSmart is more than just flour; it rises
above the average product in the category and stands out

The Persuasion Facet: Believe
When you see ads from the “Got Milk?” campaign with celebrities sporting a milk mustache,
what do you think is the objective of the advertising? Is it providing information about milk? Is
it trying to connect with you on an emotional level through fear, love, envy, hunger, or some other
feeling? Is it trying to get you to run down to the store and load up on milk? The real objective of
these ads is to change your attitude toward milk. It aims to convince you that milk isn’t just for
kids and that attractive, interesting adults drink it, too.
Persuasionis the conscious intent on the part of the source to influenceor motivate the re-
ceiver of a message to believe or do something. Persuasive communication—creating or chang-
ing attitudes and creating conviction—are important goals of most marketing communication. An
attitudeis a state of mind—a tendency, inclination, or mental readiness to react to a situation in
a given way. Since advertising rarely delivers immediate action, surrogateeffects, such as chang-
ing an attitude that leads to a behavior, are often the goal of advertising. Attitudes are the most
central factors in persuasion.
Attitudes can be positive, negative, or neutral. Both positive and negative attitudes, particu-
larly those embedded in strong emotions, can motivate people to action—or away from action. A
negative attitude toward smoking, for example, may keep teenagers from trying cigarettes, and
creating that negative attitude was the objective of the truth®campaign discussed in Chapter 1.
When people are convinced of something, their attitudes are expressed as beliefs.Sometimes
attitude strategies attempt to extinguish beliefs—for example, that getting drunk is a badge of
masculinity, overeating is acceptable, or racist and sexist comments are funny. Attitude change
strategies often use the tools of logic and reasoning, along with arguments and counterarguments,
to intensify the feelings on which beliefs are built.
Persuasion, in other words, is an area where cognitive and affective factors are interrelated—
Principle
persuasion works both through rational arguments and by touching emotions in such a way that
Advertising employs both
rational arguments and they create a compulsion to act. Persuasive strategies can be used to touch both the head and the
compelling emotions to heart. As discussed in the A Principled Practicefeature, negative advertising,or attack ads, is a

messages. presented within an emotional frame.
Factors That Drive the Persuasion Response Persuasion has many dimensions, but advertisers
identify the following factors to explain how persuasion affects consumers: motivation, influence,
involvement, engagement, conviction, preference and intention, loyalty, and believability and
credibility.
• MotivationAfactor in creating a persuasive message is motivation.Underlying motivation
is the idea that something, such as hunger or a desire to be beautiful or rich, prompts a per-
son to act in a certain way. How strongly does someone feel about acquiring something or
about taking a certain kind of action, such as applying to graduate school or signing up for
the Peace Corps? This sets up a state of tension, and the product becomes a tool in achieving
that goal and thus reducing the tension. Amore current example of the power of motivation
cropped up in the development of carrot mobs,a technique used by environmentalists to
reward companies that support green marketing. It’s a reverse boycott that uses positive
action—getting large groups of people to shop at eco-friendly stores.32

• InfluenceIf you think you need to lose weight or stop smoking, how much of that decision
is based on your own motivations and how much of your motivation results from messages
from others? Some people, known as opinion leaders,may be able to influence other peo-
ples’attitudes and convince them of the “right” decision. The idea is that other people—
friends, family, teachers, and experts such as doctors—may affect your decision making.
Testimonies—from real people, celebrities (the “Got Milk?” campaign), and experts—are
often used to change attitudes. Bandwagon appeals—messages that suggest that everyone
is doing it—are also used to influence people’s decisions. Word-of-mouthcommunication

SHOWCASE
For a YMCA membership drive in Orlando, Florida, the objective was not just to get new members, but
keep them—and keep them participating. To drive conviction, the FHB agency in Orlando developed a
campaign highlighting real members’ commitments to mind, body, and spirit. With its bold,
graphic look the campaign attracted attention and was positively received.
These ads were contributed by Lara Mann, a graduate of the University
of Florida, whose work was nominated for inclusion by Professor Elaine
Wagner.
has always been recognized as the most powerful form of persuasion, and that’s why strate-
gies that engage influencers are so important.
• InvolvementAdvertisers distinguish between products, messages, and media on the basis of
the level of involvement they require from the buyer. Involvementrefers to the degree to
which you are engaged in attending to an ad and the process you go through in responding to
a message and making a product decision. Some products, for instance, cosmetics, call for a
more involving process than others, say, toothpaste. High-involvementproducts are consid-
ered purchases;in other words, purchases for which consumers spend more time and effort
searching for information and comparison data before they make decisions. Considered
purchasesincludes such products as cars and computers, as well as things you care about a
lot like clothes and cosmetics. Examples of low-involvementproducts are aspirin, paper
napkins, envelopes, paper clips, milk, and lettuce. The idea is that you think about some
products and reflect on the advertising you see for them, but with other products you don’t
spend much time thinking about them before you buy them. Nor do you pay much attention
to their advertising, which you may ignore or file away without much thought.
Some message strategies are more involving than others, such as dramas and humor.
Likewise, various types of media are intrinsically more or less involving. Television, for ex-
ample, is considered to be less involving than print, which demands more concentration
from its readers than TVdoes of its viewers—although a gripping TVdrama can be involv-
CHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 119
ing because of the power of the storyline. Marketing communication tools, such as sales pro-
motions, events, and brand clubs, are inherently more involving, particularly the ones that
allow customers to have more personal contact with the brand.
• EngagementThe idea of engagementis that a consumer is more than just interested in
something, that he or she is, in the words of the Advertising Research Foundation committee
that investigated engagement, “turned on.”33Participation strategies, for example, get con-
sumers involved with a brand on a personal level. Engagement cultivates passion.
• ConvictionEffective persuasion results in conviction,which means consumers agree with a
persuasive message and achieve a state of certainty—a belief—about a brand. Afactor in
conviction is the power of the argument,which uses logic, reasons, and proof to make a
point and build conviction. Understanding an argument is a complex cognitive process that
demands the audience “follow through” on the reasoning to understand the point and reach a
conclusion.
• Preference and IntentionWhen consumers marry belief with a preferencefor, or an
intentionto try or buy, a product, they are motivated by conviction. Intention can be
heightened with reward strategies, such as good deals, sale pricing, and gifts. An example
of persuasive work designed to create conviction is the Orlando, Florida, YMCAads. Good
intentions are the motivations behind cause marketing and social responsibility. Hewlett-
Packard, for example, promotes its computer recycling program to increase preference for
HPproducts by its customers. According to the company’s vice president of global brand-
ing and marketing communication, the PC recycling program attracts consumers to HP
products because the company assumes responsibility for recycling its old products. That’s
a benefit for customers and leads to higher customer satisfaction and, thus, loyalty to the
HPbrand.
• LoyaltyIs there any brand you buy, use, or visit on a regular basis? Do you have a favorite
shampoo, restaurant, or beverage? Why is that? What we are referring to when we talk about
a “favorite” brand is preference, but also brand loyalty,which we mentioned in Chapter 2.
Loyaltyis an attitude (respect, preference), an emotion (liking), and an action (repeat pur-
chases). It is a response to brand communication that crosses over between thinking, feeling,
and doing—a response that is built on customer satisfaction.If you try a product and like it,
then you will be more likely to buy it again. If you don’t like it, is there a return policy or
guarantee that frees you from risk when you buy something for the first time? Providing in-
formation about warranties, customer service, and technical support for technology products
is an important part of brand loyalty strategies. The idea is to reduce risk and put the cus-
tomer’s mind at ease. Incentives are also used in loyalty programs, such as frequent flyer or
frequent buyer programs. In addition, social responsibility and cause marketing programs
can build trust, respect, and preference that lead to loyalty.
• Believability and CredibilityAn important issue in persuasion is believability,which refers
to the credibility of the arguments in a message. Puffery or unprovable claims, such as the
common phrase “9 out of 10 doctors recommend . . .” can strain believability. Related to
believability is credibility, which is an indication of the trustworthiness of the source.
Source credibilitymeans the person delivering the message, such as an expert, is respected,
trusted, and believable.
Bob Garfield, respected Advertising Agecolumnist, points out in his recent book, The
Chaos Scenario,that you trust messages from friends more than from any sort of commer-
cial message—“anything dictated to you by Procter & Gamble channeling its marketing
message through Mr. Whipple. . . .”34That explains the power of word-of-mouth and viral
online communication. Trust is also a factor in media choice. We watch certain television
news programs, read newspapers, and subscribe to specific magazines because we trust them
as information sources.
Credibility is one of the big advantages of public relations because publicity stories de-
livered through a supposedly unbiased news medium have higher credibility than advertis-
ing, which is seen as self-serving. However, advertising can use a credibility strategy to
intensify the believability of its message. After the oil spill off the Louisisan coast, BPused
advertising to say that the company was committed to cleaning up the mess. The strategy
hinges on the company’s credibility. Using data to support or prove a claim, for example,
gives consumers a reason to believethe advertising.
120 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND
The Behavior Facet: Act/Do
We introduced loyalty in the previous section on
persuasion and noted that it intersects with behavior.
Behavior can involve different types of action in ad-
dition to trying or buying the product. The goal is to
get people to act in various ways—to try or buy the
brand, for example, or visit a store, return an inquiry
card, call a toll-free number, join an organization,
donate to a good cause, or click on a website. The “I
Want You” World War I poster by artist James Mont-
gomery Flagg is a classic example of an advertising
message that was designed to create action. It’s been
used many times by other organizations to create
that same compelling message.

Factors That Drive the Behavioral Response The behavioral response involving action of some
kind is often the most important goal of marketing communication, particularly tools such as sales
promotion and direct marketing. Factors that drive a behavioral response include mental re-
hearsal, trial, buying, contacting, advocating and referrals, and prevention.
• Mental RehearsalThemental rehearsalof behaviors is made possible by showing visuals
of people doing things. As Charles Young explains,36one of the functions of advertising is to
create virtual memories, in other words, experiences that we can imagine ourselves doing.
Visualization is an imagined action, but one that is the predecessor to the behaviors with
which the advertiser hopes the consumer will feel comfortable and familiar.
• TrialThe first step in making a purchase is often to try the product. Atrialis important for
new products and expensive products because it lets a customer use the product without
initially committing to a purchase. In other words, the risk is reduced. Sales promotion is
particularly good at driving trials through special price deals, sampling, and incentive pro-
grams that motivate behavior, such as a free gift when you go to a dealer to test drive a new car.
• BuyingThe objective of most marketing programs is sales. In advertising, sales is some-
times stimulated by the call to actionat the end of the ad, along with information on where
to purchase the product. From a customer perspective, sales means making a purchase. In
customer-focused marketing programs, the goal is to motivate people to try or buy a certain
brand. But in some marketing programs, such as those for nonprofit organizations, the mar-
CHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 121
keting program may be designed to encourage the audience to sign up,
volunteer, or donate. For many managers, however, sales is the gold stan-
dard for effective advertising. They feel that, even if they are funny, mem-
orable, or entertaining, ads are failures if they don’t help sell the brand.
The problem is that it may be difficult to prove that a marketing communi-
cation message is the one factor in the marketing mix that delivered the
sales. It could be the price, the distribution, the product design and perfor-
mance, or some combination of the marketing mix elements. Effectiveness
programs, such as the London-based Institute of Practitioners Award pro-
gram (IPA), encourage advertisers to use research to prove that it was, in
fact, the advertising that actually drove the sales.
• ContactingTrying and buying may be the marketer’s dream response, but
other actions also can be important measures of an advertisement’s behav-
ioral effectiveness. Responding by making contactwith the advertiser can be
an important sign of effectiveness. Initiating contact is also valuable, particu-
larly in IMC programs designed to maintain brand relationships by creating
opportunities for customer-initiated dialogue, such as encouraging customers
with a complaint, compliment, or suggestion to contact the company.
• Advocating and ReferralsOne of the behavioral dimensions of brand loy-
alty is advocacy,or speaking out on a brand’s behalf and referring to it
when someone asks for a recommendation. Contacting other people is a
valuable response, particularly when a satisfied customer brings in more
business for the brand by providing testimonials to friends, family, and
colleagues on behalf of the brand. In terms of the impact of referrals,
when a satisfied customer recommends a favorite brand, this form of word
of mouth can be incredibly persuasive, more so than advertising, which is
seen as self-serving. Apple Computer’s success is credited to its passionate
customers who, as evangelists for the brand, spread the word among their
friends and coworkers.
Thisadvocacy level, which Smith and Cross describe in their book,
Customer Bonding,37represents the highest form of a brand relationship.
Arecommendation to buy a specific brand is the ultimate test of the bond
between consumers and their favorite brands. And the opposite—brand
aversion—can be disastrous if the dissatisfied customer shares his or her
dislike with other people.

Interaction and Impact
As we had suggested, these six factors, when they work together, can create a
coherent brand perception. You should remember two things about how this
122 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND
model works: (1) the effects are interdependent, and (2) they are not all equal for all marketing
communication situations.
In terms of effects interaction, we suggested in the previous discussions that cognitive and
emotional responses work together. Consider that memory is a function of both attention (the
perception facet) and emotion (the affective facet). As du Plessis explains, “What we pay at-
tention to, we remember.”38The stronger the emotional hook, the more likely we’ll attend to
and remember the message. Even informative messages can be made more memorable if they
are presented with an emotional story. Furthermore, recent ideas about how advertising mem-
ory works suggest that an effective ad helps consumers remember their best moments with a
product,39so it brings back emotion-laden brand experiences that encompass both feelings and
thoughts.
Agood example of the interplay between thinking and feeling is found in the public service
LATCH campaign, which was designed to build awareness of the child safety problem, but also ex-
plain what parents need to do to make their kids safe in a car seat, and carefully engage emotions
such as love and the concern that drives protectiveness. The Inside Storyexplains the thinking be-
hind the campaign.
In terms of impact, we recognize that different advertising strategies emphasize different
patterns of impact. Sometimes more emphasis in a message strategy needs to be placed on
emotion or image building than on reasons and facts. Therefore, a specific strategy for an ad-
vertising campaign may be depicted as heavier in one area than another. In such a situation,
the actual shape of the facets model can change as the pattern of emphasis is adapted to the
marketing situation with emotion and association, for example, or cognition or persuasion in-
creasing in size.
Strong and Weak Effects
Some believe that sales is the only true indication of message
effectiveness. The power of advertising, in other words, is de-
termined by its ability to motivate consumers to buy a brand.
Some even believe advertising is so powerful that it can moti-
vate people to buy things they don’t need, as the ad by the
American Association of Advertising Agencies (4As) suggests.
Others, including the authors of this textbook, believe
communication effects include a wide range of consumer re-
sponses to a message—responses that may be just as impor-
tant as sales because they lead to the creation of such things
as liking and a long-term brand relationship. This power is
analyzed in terms of “strong” and “weak” effects.40
This debate is the source of controversy in the analysis
of what advertising effectiveness really represents. The sales-
oriented philosophy suggests advertising can move the
masses to action. Those who believe in the “strong” theory of
advertising reason along these lines:
Advertising increases people’s knowledge and
changes people’s attitudes and,therefore,it is ca-
pable of persuading people who had not formerly
bought a brand to buy it, at first once and then
repeatedly.
In contrast, those who believe in the “weak” theory of ad-
vertising, like the British promotions person quoted at the
beginning of this chapter, think that advertising has only a
limited impact on consumers and is best used to reinforce
existing brand perceptions rather than changeattitudes:

These differences explain why some experts believe that the communication effects, such as
emotion, knowledge, and persuasion, are merely “surrogate” effects—communication effects that
can be measured more easily than sales but are less important to marketing managers. Others be-
lieve these communication effects are important in and of themselves because of what they con-
tribute to brand strength.
Complicating the issue is the recognition that the impact of traditional advertising is seldom
immediate. When you see an ad for a new product that catches your attention, such as a new mu-
sic group or CD, and you concentrate on the message, you may think about the ad later when you
find yourself walking by a music store. Thus, your memory is involved in recalling not just the
ad and the brand, but the content of the message. But memory is unreliable and the impressions
may not be embedded sufficiently in memory to elicit this kind of response at a later date.

In other words, advertising is a victim of delayed effects:messages are seen and heard at

Does It or Doesn’t It?
Considering all that you’ve learned in this chapter about advertising effectiveness, if you were
asked, where would you come down in this debate about the power of advertising—strong or
weak effects?
If you are interested in learning more about how advertising and other marketing communi-
cation work in order to answer questions like that, then see the Practical Tipsfeature by Profes-
sor Sheri Broyles at www.pearsonhighered.com/moriarty and consult some of the fascinating

Long-term research by retired Syracuse professor John Philip Jones using extensive indus-
try data proves that there is a link between advertising and consumer behavior and that advertis-
ing can trigger sales.41The problem has always been understanding how it works,and, in many
cases,how it doesn’t work.The facets model takes a step forward in helping the industry create a
logical framework for analyzing advertising effects. The important conclusion to the bigger ques-
tion about how advertising works is that we know that advertising (and other marketing commu-
nication) does work when it’s carefully planned and executed. It may not work in every situation
and every ad may not be equally effective, but if it’s done right, then advertising can have impact
on consumer responses. That’s why the Effie awards, and other award shows that recognize ef-
fectiveness, are so valuable.
Looking Ahead
To a great extent, the impact of the recession lies in the emotional facet. Instead of snarly, sar-
castic, and cutting responses, researchers have decided that the recession ushered in an Age of
Nice—think bright yellow smiley faces. Graceann Bennett, strategic planner at Ogilvy &
Mather’s Chicago office, explains in a New York Timesarticle that her clients frequently critique
ad ideas by saying “we don’t want mean.”42Even Pepsi’s new logo in 2009 was characterized as
looking like the smiley face. Mocking ads worked to the degree that they tapped into people’s frus-
trations over the economy. Earnestness and altruism became the new face of consumer culture—
and consumer culture is what we’ll talk about in the next chapter.
“I love you, man” and “Have a nice day.”
CHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 125
IT’S A WRAP
Pitch Perfect: Ford’s in SYNC
with Singer/Songwriter
Dave Rodriguez, multicultural marketing communication manager for Ford, summed up the SYNC cam-
paign’s ability to reach the Hispanic target audience: “Ford, SYNC and Juanes are just the perfect fit be-
cause we’re all focused on the importance of being able to connect with people. Staying connected to friends
and music while on the go is no longer a trend, it’s part of everyday life for our Hispanic target and SYNC
brings this power exclusively to Ford drivers.”
When advertising is able to connect its audience with a powerful message about a meaningful product,
it gets results. It built brand awareness of the new technology through experiential activities, which made the
Hispanic target audience aware of SYNC and educated them about its benefits. About 100,000 consumers
visited SYNC Zones at the Juanes concerts and almost 200,000 unique visitors visited the syncjuanes.com site.
The campaign successfully engaged significantly more participants than expected—about 63,000 regis-
trations and 30,000 hand-raisers who opted in for future Ford communications. Once the consumers under-
stood and experienced SYNC, they were likely to move closer to a purchase decision. The campaign
generated test-drive leads and test drives with a test-drive conversion rate of almost 30 percent (15 times the
industry average). For its excellent work, Ford and Zubi won a Silver Effie.

Old Navy SuperModelquins Reveal Secrets
If sales are slumping, as is the case for many companies including Old Navy during
the latest recession, what can be done to reverse the downward trend? What role
does branding play in the process, and how does brand communication work?
To answer these questions, let’s start with a discussion of Old Navy’s “Su-
perModelquins” campaign. Have you seen it? If not, introduce yourself to the
models at www.oldnavyweekly.com. You’ll discover the mannequins have
names, love lives, families, and careers. Here’s an excerpt from the introduction
video, which highlights Old Navy merchandise as the models reveal their secrets:
Narrator: “The SuperModelquins. They pose. They smile. They pose some
more. But what’s behind those chiseled good looks and perma-
smiles? We’ll find out as we meet fashion’s hottest new mannequins.
Kelly started out as a small town mannequin with big dreams. She
was discovered here in the humble window of Wilma’s Wearables by
a mannequin scout.
Kelly: He offered me a card and a first-class crate to the big city.
Narrator: Kelly was a hit, especially with the soon-to-be men’s wear super-
star, Josh.
Josh: She was being wheeled by and I just froze.
Narrator: They were soon inseparable. Then a call came in. Old Navy was look-
ing for a star and loved Kelly’s fresh-faced look. Her life was moving
so fast that love couldn’t keep up. In the fall 2005 Josh and Kelly split
up. Kelly had found herself a fresh start and new friends like Michelle.
Michelle: Being here with Wesley and my kids keeps me grounded. Well, that
and my metal stand.
Narrator: Michelle and Wesley met in the spring of 2001 at an auto show. She
was working as a minivan display model, he as a crash test dummy.
In 2001, they tied the knot in the bridal section of a department
store and two months later they became SuperModelquins. But
there was one thing missing from the picture: kids.

What do you think? Do you like the quirky campaign with the talking models?
What did you like or not like about it? Do you think it was effective advertising? This
chapter challenges you to think deeply about what makes brands work to accomplish
their business objectives by truly reaching the minds and emotions of their audiences.
First, some background about Old Navy, an offshoot of the Gap. Although Old
Navy has long stood for value—low budget and somewhat trendy fashions—
recently it has faced fierce competition from Target and Kohl’s. Old Navy’s sales
were down significantly. Sure, part of the downturn is probably due to the econ-
omy. But what can be done to reverse the losses?
Old Navy President Tom Wyatt put his finger on part of the problem: the company
lost its way when it abandoned the target of moms with young children and focused
on teens. A gold-lamé bikini, such as the one featured in a recent ad campaign, is not
what a 25- to 35-year-old mom is looking for, said Wyatt. Moms went elsewhere to
shop. The first step of Old Navy’s strategy called for a renewed focus on young moms.
To appeal to moms, the campaign used 12 mock supermodels with celebrity-
worthy stories. They’re featured on TV and the Web on Old Navy’s website.
They’ve been featured in a flyer patterned after a celebrity magazine. You can fol-
low them on Twitter. These pseudo-celebs have made appearances at an NBA Lak-
ers game, a celebrity party in New York, and a trendy restaurant in Los Angeles.
SuperModelquins—some 13,000 of them—may even have made their way to an
Old Navy store near you. (Incidentally, you may be interested to know that the cam-
paign’s done wonders for Fusion Specialties, the mannequins’ maker.)
In your analysis of the campaign’s effectiveness, one of the first questions you
should ask yourself is “Does this reach the target audience?” Do you think these
SuperModelquins “speak” to young moms? A critical lesson is that ads that are
based on understanding the consumer market are more likely to speak to their in-
terests. At the end of the chapter, in the It’s a Wrapfeature, you can find out how
well Old Navy achieved its goals.

The success of campaigns, such as the Old Navy “SuperModelquins” campaign, hinges on a critical
consumer insight that gives direction to the advertising. By recognizing that the store’s ads were speak-
ing to the wrong audience, the CP(cid:2)B team was able to develop a storyline that young mothers would
find interesting and fun; at the same time it showcased fashions that were relevant to this audience.

WHAT INFLUENCES CONSUMER DECISIONS?
Think about something you bought last week. How did the purchase process happen? Was it
something you needed or just something you wanted? These are the kinds of questions marketers
and advertisers ask about their customers. Consumer behavior describes how individuals or
CHAPTER 5 • SEGMENTING AND TARGETING THE AUDIENCE 131
groups select, purchase, use, or dispose of products, as well as the needs and wants that motivate
these behaviors. As we proceed through this chapter, keep asking yourself these questions about
your own consumer behavior and that of your friends and family.
As our opening story stressed, marketing communication planners need to understand what
appeals to customers and why. Then they need to be able to describe prospective customers us-
ing characteristics that help predict the likelihood that they will respond to a brand message and,
ultimately, buy the brand.
There are various ways to segment consumers and target a market. One way is to divide them

cause purchasers and users can have different needs and wants. In the case of children’s cereals,
parents (the purchasers) often look for nutritional value and a decent price. In contrast, children
(the users) may look for a sweet taste and a package with a prize inside.
Before we review how consumers make a buying decision, let’s consider the various factors
that influence them: their cultural affinities, their family and friends, their personal needs, and
their experiences with a brand. Figure 5.1is a general model of consumer behavior. It is also a vi-
sual road map for this chapter. We will begin by discussing three types of influences that affect
the way consumers make purchasing decisions. Then we’ll use that knowledge to explain how
audiences are profiled, segmented, and then targeted with specific types of messages.

Generally culture is seen as providing a deep-seated context for marketing communication,
but popular culture—what we see on television, sports, fashion, and music among other areas—
is dynamic. Lee Clow, chairman and chief creative direct of TBWA/Worldwide, who also created
the legendary “1984” Macintosh commercial discussed in Chapter 1, observed that “you have to
do advertising at the speed of culture.” He was referring to the transformation brought by the In-
ternet and other new forms of digital communication, but his point is that “culture is moving very
fast and it’s very responsive.”1
Norms and Values The boundaries each culture establishes for “proper” behavior are norms,
which are simply rules we learn through social interaction that specify or prohibit certain behav-
iors. The source of norms is our values,particularly cultural values, which represent our under-
lying belief systems. In the United States, we value freedom, independence, and individualism;
in other countries, particularly some Asian and Latin countries, people value families and groups
more than individualism. Of course, there are some universals—most people value good health
and most women want to look good. An example of ads that appeal to Americans’nostalgia is the
76 campaign aimed at truckers.
Values are few in number and hard to change. Advertisers strive to understand the underly-
ingcore valuesthat govern people’s attitudes and guide their behavior. An ad’s primary appeal
aims to match the core values of the brand to the core values of the audience. Here are 10 basic
core values that, in many cases, transcend cultural differences:

Oregon.

Social Class The position you and your family occupy within your society is called a social
class,and it is determined by such factors as income, wealth, education, occupation, family pres-
tige, value of home, and neighborhood. In more rigid societies, such as those of India, people have
a difficult time moving out of the class into which they were
born. In the United States, although people may move into
social classes that differ from their families’, the country still
has a class system consisting of upper, middle, and lower
classes. Marketers assume that people in one class buy dif-
ferent goods for different reasons than people in other
classes.
Reference Groups Areference groupis a group of people
you use as a model for behavior in specific situations. Exam-
ples are teachers and religious leaders, as well as members of
political parties, religious groups, racial or ethnic organiza-
tions, hobby-based clubs, and informal affiliations such as
fellow workers or students—your peers.
Brand communities,such as the Harley Owners Group
(HOG) for Harley-Davidson, are groups of people devoted to
a particular brand. To get a sense of how this group operates,

related clothing, and sport Mac tattoos and shaved Mac

group out of respect or admiration. Advertisers use celebrity endorsements to tap into this appeal.
The Old Navy “SuperModelquins” campaign played with the idea that models and mannequins
set fashion and appearance standards.
Sociologist David Reisman describes individuals in terms of their relationships to other peo-
ple as inner directed(individualistic) or outer directed(peer group and society). Advertisers are
particularly interested in the role of peers in influencing their outer-directed friends’wants and
desires. On the other hand, inner-directed people are more likely to try new things first.
Family The family is the most important reference group for many people because of its for-
mative role and the intensity of its relationships. Other reference groups, such as peers, cowork-
ers, and neighbors, tend to change as we age. According to the U.S. Census definition, a family
consists of two or more people who are related by blood, marriage, or adoption and live in the
same household. Ahouseholddiffers from a family in that it consists of all those who occupy a
dwelling whether they are related or not. The family is responsible for raising children and es-
tablishing a lifestyle for family members. Lifestylereflects family situation, values, and income.
It determines the way people spend their time and money and the kinds of activities they value.
In the 21st century—for the first time in U.S. history—one-person households outnumber
married couples with children. This reflects a growing trend in America during the past 30 years
to marry later in life, divorce, or never get married at all. Marketers and their advertisers have
been right on top of this trend. Banks have created special mortgages, builders are providing
homes and apartments to meet the needs of single occupants, and food marketers have introduced
“single” portions.
Psychological Influences
We have analyzed cultural and social influenceson consumer behavior. Now let’s look at the
personal characteristics that affect how you respond as an individual. The psychological factors
of interest to advertisers include state of mind, needs and wants, motivations, as well as attitudes,
personality, and thoughts and thinking patterns.

buysomething.
Needs and Wants In Chapter 4, we described needs and wants as two different types of re-
sponses that lead to different reactions to an advertising message. The basic driving forces that
motivate us to do something that reflect basic survival, such as choose a motel (shelter) or restau-
rant (food) when traveling, are called needs. Primary needs(biological) include the need for wa-
ter, food, air, and shelter. In the case of the needs pyramid developed by psychologist Abraham
Maslow (see Figure 5.2), these are called physiological and safety needs.
Needs we learn in response to our culture and environment are called acquired needs.These
may include the need for esteem, prestige, affection, power, learning, and, yes, beauty. Because
acquired needs are not necessary to your physical survival, they are also called secondary needs.
Maslow called them social (belonging),egoistic,andself-actualization.The Old Navy campaign,
with its moderate-priced fashion line, builds demand for products that address acquired needs.
Awant occurs when we desire or wish for something—we won’t die if we don’t get it, but
it can still provide a strong motivation to try or buy something new. This is particularly true in
fashion areas, such as clothing and music. Research has uncovered the power of new and novel.
As account planner Susan Mendelsohn explains, “In some cases, we want things just for the sheer
fun of newness—think about how many pairs of shoes or the amount of clothes people have.”4
Desire is the driving force behind demand and successful brands focus more on what we
want than on what we need. Brian Martin, the founder of Brand Connections, has built a list of
10 desires that successful brands satisfy:5
1. To feel safe and secure
2. To feel comfortable

• SatisfactionAfeeling of satisfaction is only one possible response to a brand message or
brand experience; more troublesome is dissatisfaction or doubt. People can pay attention to a
commercial, then buy a product and be disappointed. One of the reasons is that advertising
sometimes raises consumers’expectations too high, in other words, it promises more than it
can deliver.
• DissonanceCognitive dissonancerefers to a conflict between two thoughts—you want to
buy a car but don’t have the money. That creates a state of tension. Marketers must address
the negative side and, in auto marketing, they do that by offering no or low interest plans to
reduce the conflict and make it easier to justify or rationalize the decision. Buyer’s remorse
is another form of tension and it occurs when there are discrepancies between what we
thought we would receive and what we actually received. When there is a difference be-
tween reality and facts, people engage in a variety of activities to reduce cognitive disso-
nance. Most notably, we seek out information that supports our decisions—that’s why we
pay attention to ads for products we have already bought—and ignore and distort informa-
tion that does not. For example, car makers use testimonials from satisfied customers. An
important category of automotive service called “aftermarketing” is designed to keep cus-
tomers happy after they buy a car.
Motivations Amotiveis an internal force—like the desire to look good—that stimulates you to
behave in a particular manner. This driving force is produced by the tension caused by an unful-
filled want or need. People strive to reduce the tension, as the Airborne ad demonstrates. At any
given point you are probably affected by a number of different motives—your motivation to buy

a new suit will be much higher if you have several job inter-
views scheduled next week.
Research into motivation uncovers the “why” questions:
Why did you buy that brand and not another? What prompted
you to go to that store? Understanding buying motives is cru-
cial to advertisers because the advertising message should re-
flect consumers’ motivations. Unfortunately motivations
operate largely at an unconscious level. Some of the reasons
may be apparent—you go to a restaurant because you are hun-
gry. But what else governs that choice—is it location, interior
decoration, a favorite menu item, or the recommendation of a
friend?

At one point in its history, Coca-Cola viewed the U.S. market for its brand as homogeneous and
used general appeals—such as “Coke is it!”—for all consumers, which is considered an “undiff-
erentiated” strategy.But even Coke is sold in different types of places, and people hear about
Coke through different types of media. Therefore, customers are grouped almost by definition,
based on their contact points with the product. Of course, there are also differences in age, for in-
stance, between a long-time adult Coke drinker and a teenager.
Consumer differences, as well as product variations, determine how marketers address peo-
ple in marketing communication and reach them using media. In other words, few examples of
homogeneous markets exist in contemporary marketing, consequently most strategies are based
on a market segmentationapproach that drives marketing communication strategies.
By using a segmentation strategy, a company can more precisely match the needs and wants
of the customer with its products. That’s why soft drink manufacturers such as Coke and Pepsi
have moved away from an undifferentiated approach and introduced product variations to ap-
peal to different consumer segments, such as diet, caffeine-free, diet caffeine-free, and flavored
138 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND
versions of their basic products. This approach also allows a company to target advertising mes-
sages by more precisely matching the interests, attitudes, and preferences of consumers in each
segment of the soft-drink market.
Although marketing has gone global to reach large markets, many advertisers have moved
toward tighter and tighter niche markets,which are subsegments of a more general market seg-
ment. Individuals in a niche market, such as ecologically minded mothers who won’t use dispos-
able diapers, are defined by a distinctive interest or attitude. Instead of marketing to the masses,
marketers target narrow segments, such as single women in the international traveler category or
pogo-stick riders in the extreme sports category. Although large companies may develop niche
strategies, niche marketers are companies that pursue market segments of sufficient size to be
profitable although not large enough to be of interest to large marketers. Exploritas, for example,
markets to seniors who are interested in educationally oriented travel experiences.
Consumers in niche markets may be more passionate about their favorite brands than gen-
eral consumer markets. For example, Celestial Seasonings sells one variety called Roastaroma. It
is a caffeine-free alternative to coffee. True to Celestial’s commitment to herbal ingredients,
Roastaroma is made from roasted barley, chicory, and carob, as well as cinnamon, allspice, and
Chinese star anise. It’s not a popular flavor and has a low sales level, but when Celestial tried to
discontinue the line, the company was flooded with letters from irate customers protesting the
decision—and Celestial Seasonings gave in to its small band of Roastaroma drinkers.

• Life-Stage Segmentationis based on the particular stage in consumers’life cycle, which in-
cludes such categories as children, young people living at home, college students, singles
living on their own, couples, families with children, empty nesters, and senior singles living
alone. Age is a characteristic of life stage, as is living situation.
• Geographic Segmentationuses location as a defining variable because consumers’needs
sometimes vary depending on where they live—urban, rural, suburban, North, South. The
most important variables are world or global, region, nation, state, city, or zip code. Factors
related to these decisions include climate, population density, and urban/rural character. Ge-
ography affects both product distribution and marketing communication.

• Psychographic Segmentationis primarily based on studies of how people spend their
money, their patterns of work and leisure, their interest and opinions, and their views of
themselves. This strategy is considered richer than demographic segmentation because it
combines psychological information with lifestyle insights.
• Behavioral Segmentationdivides people into groups based on product category and brand
usage.
• Values and Benefits-Based Segmentationgroups people based on tangible and intangible fac-
tors. Values segmentation reflects consumers’underlying value system—spiritual, hedonistic,
thrifty, and so forth. Benefit segmentation is based on consumers’needs or problems. The idea
is that people buy products for different benefits they hope to derive. For example, car buyers
might be grouped based on whether they are motivated by concerns for safety, gas mileage,
durability/dependability, performance and handling, luxury, or enhancement of self-image.

Demographics
The statistical, social, and economic characteristics of a population, including such factors as
age, gender and sexual orientation, education, occupation, income, family status, race, religion,
and geography are called demographics.These characteristics serve as the basis for identifying
potential audiences, and knowing these factors helps advertisers in message design and media se-
lection for the target market.The first place to start when analyzing and compiling demograph-
ics is the country’s census data. In the United States, the Census Bureau compiles a huge
collection of demographic information every 10 years—the most recent census was in 2010.
Age The most important demographic characteristic used by advertising planners is age. Peo-
ple of different ages have different needs and wants. An advertising message must be geared to
the target audience’s age group and should be delivered through a medium that members of the
group use. But age also determines product choice. How old are you? What products did you use
5 or 10 years ago that you don’t use now? Look ahead 10 years. What products might you be in-
terested in buying in the future that you don’t buy now?

Consider the age categories in the following list and the breakdowns in Table 5.1. What is the
size of your age group? Which groups are the largest and smallest, and what types of products
would they be most interested in buying? An age group often targeted by advertising planners is
ages 35 to 54. This group could be generally described as middle aged—how important is it in
terms of its size? The following list describes some of the other more common age-related popu-
lation categories that are used by marketers:
Age-Related Population Categories
• Referred to as the Greatest Generationby Tom Brokaw in his book by that name, this genera-
tion born in the 1910s through the late 1920s lived through the Great Depression and fought
World War II. Asmall group, these seniors are in their final years. This group opened up college
education to the middle class after the war and lived frugal, yet financially satisfying, lives.
• Known as the Silent Generationortraditionalists,these people born from the late 1920s to the
war years are now active seniors. They were described in a national poll as the generation having
the most “positive impact” on the American economy for their role in fueling the postwar boom.8
• Baby boomers,people born between 1946 and 1964, represent the largest age-related cate-
gory in the United States. The 78 million baby boomer consumers are now in the final years
of their careers, having made a huge population bulge as they have moved through the life
cycle. While they were growing up, boomers’numbers affected first schools, then the job
market, and now retirement programs and health care. This generation has been influenced
by significant societal movements and scientific breakthroughs, from the Civil Rights move-
ment to the anti–Vietnam War protests to putting a person on the moon, although the term
boomerhas also become associated with greedy, spoiled, divorced, mega-shoppers who
want it all.9
• Anewly identified subgroup called Generation Jonesis the younger baby boomers who were
born from the mid- to late 1950s through the mid-1960s. The Jonesreference comes from
their continuing need to chase the dream of affluence by trying to “keep up with the Joneses.”
• Gen X,also known as Baby Busters,is the group whose 70 million members were born be-
tween 1965 and 1979. Now adults, they have been described as independent minded and
somewhat cynical. They are concerned with their physical health (they grew up during the
AIDS outbreak) and financial future (the job market became more difficult just about the
time they entered).
• Sometimes referred to as the Me Generationbecause of their affluent younger years, those born
in the 1970s to early 1990s are characterized as more self-absorbed and narcissistic than their
parents, although that changed as they confronted the dot.combust at the end of the 1990s.
• Born between 1980 and 1996, members of Generation Yare also known as Echo Boomers,
as well as the Me Generation,because they are the children of baby boomers. They are im-
portant to marketers, because they are next in size to the boomer generation with 100 million
plus members. This generation is also described as the DigitalorNet Generation10because
they grew up with computers and are seen as more technologically savvy than their older
siblings or parents. This group is now the young adult market that marketers want most to
reach because they are in the formative years of their brand relationships. They are the first
generation to grow up with e-mail and cell phones.
• Millennialsencompass those 80 million children born from the late 1990s into the beginning
decade of the new century. Also called the iGeneration,these folks spend considerably more
time texting and using social media than even the older Net Generation. Initially marketers
were delighted to find that these kids (and their doting parents) were brand conscious and
more willing than their predecessors to wear a brand logo as a badge.11But that changed as
they became teenagers and had to confront the problems of the recession that dragged down
the economy in the late 2000s. They are known as the most environmentally educated gener-
ation with 76 percent believing that brands should be ecologically conscious. They are also
seen as having outlandish personal expectations and a feeling of entitlement,12although the
recession may have toned that down a bit.
Age is a key factor in media plans because age usually determines what media you watch,
listen to, or read. Note how the radio script for the public service LATCH campaign about child
car safety, which we introduced in Chapter 4, plays with the idea of generations. The older the
CHAPTER 5 • SEGMENTING AND TARGETING THE AUDIENCE 141
age group, the more likely they are to use media daily or several times a week and the more likely
they are to read newspapers. Overall usage patterns for each medium vary by age group. For in-
stance, 88 percent of “mature” audience members watch local broadcast news.13Kids ages 8 to
18 now spend more than 71/2 hours a day with electronic devices, which include smart phones,
computers, televisions and video games, a finding that shocked researchers in 2010 who thought
the day couldn’t continue to expand to fit in more wired activities.14

Age is driving a fundamental shift in U.S. marketing strategy. For 50 years, marketers have
focused on reaching young people, not only because they are in the formative years of making
brand choices, but also because the youth market during that era was huge in terms of numbers.
Now with the boomer bulge moving into retirement, there is tension between the temptation to
focus on young people and the realization that wealth and numbers belong to this active senior
market. Not only is the senior marketing getting larger, a Pew Research Center study finds a
growing generation gap between old and young. Almost 80 percent believe the viewpoints are
dramatically different and this shows up in attitudes toward religion, values, morality, lifestyles,
manners, and work ethic.15
Gender and Sexual Orientation An obvious basis for differences in marketing and advertising
is gender. The fact that interests marketers is that women account for 85 percent of all consumer
purchases in the United States.16So it’s important to know what attracts a female market and how
you build brand relationships with them. The Boston Consulting Group spotted the first stages of
the United States evolving to a matriarchal society in the mid-2000s.17Their research, and more
recent studies, point to the increasing percentage of women in college,18which also may mean
eventual changes in income and occupation patterns.
Many brands are either masculine or feminine in terms of use, as well as brand personality.
It is unlikely that men would use a brand of cologne called “White Shoulders.” The Gillette Com-
pany found that the majority of women would not purchase regular Gillette razor blades, so they
introduced brands exclusively for women, such as the Daisy disposable razors. An interesting
story is that Marlboro started off as a cigarette marketed to women and was later targeted to men
with the cowboy image.
Gender stereotypes have been a problem in advertising for decades and some believe that
may be because the majority of the work has been created by men. Jessica Shank, a copywriter at
Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, explored that idea and concluded, “If most of the work specifi-
cally aimed at women were any indication of modern life, we’d all be at home dancing with our
mops and fretting about plastic food storage.” She explains, “There’s a real disconnect between
the lives women lead and the way advertising portrays our daily lives and desires.”19
During the past decade sexual orientation has also become a marketing issue as gay and
lesbian consumers have become serious target markets. Bob Witeck, CEO of Washington,
D.C.–based Witeck-Combs Communications, estimates that the buying power of this market is
conservatively estimated at $712 billion. He’s basing that on a population estimate of approxi-
mately 15 million, which would be 6.7 percent of the population.20In the A Matter of Practice
feature at www.pearsonhighered.com/moriarty,Witeck explains how this market dealt with the
economic downturn.
Education, Occupation, and Income According to the 2009 Census Report, U.S. males are
falling behind females in higher levels of education. Generally, white U.S. consumers attain
higher levels of education than blacks and Hispanics. For advertisers, education also tends to cor-
relate with the type of medium consumers prefer. Consumers with lower education are higher
users of television, especially cable. Consumers with higher education prefer print media, the In-
ternet, and selected radio and cable stations. Likewise, education dictates the way copy is written
and its level of difficulty. Examine ads in FortuneorForbesand you will find different words, art,
and products than you will in Peopleortabloidpublications. Advertisers don’t make value judg-
ments about these statistics. Their objective is to match advertising messages to the characteris-
tics of the target audience.
Most people identify themselves by what they do. In the United States there has been a grad-
ual trend from blue-collar occupations (manufacturing, for example) to white-collar occupations
(management and information). There have also been shifts within white-collar work from
salesto other areas, such as professional, technical, and administrative positions. The number of
service-related jobs continues to increase, especially in the health care, education, and legal and
business service sectors. Much of this transition is a direct result of computer technologies, which
have eliminated many labor-intensive, blue-collar occupations. This shift has affected advertis-
ing in a number of ways: today, advertisements seldom portray blue-collar jobs, for example.
Another key demographic indicator for many advertisers is income. You are meaningful to
marketers to the extent that you have the resources to buy their products or services or contribute

Family Status Age also relates to family status. The trends during the past 30 years have been
for people to increasingly be older when they marry, and the number of families also continues
to shrink. Although families dominate American households, they are fewer in number than in
1980. In data reported in 2009, 67 percent of the households were families and 33 percent were
singles. The composition of households is particularly important in media planning where many
of the decisions are based on reaching households who subscribe or view programs, rather than
individuals. That’s because the media vehicles generally report their data, and compute their im-
pact (readers, users, viewers) based on household estimates.
Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration In the United States, ethnicity is a major factor in segment-
ing markets. According to 2009 Census Bureau data, Hispanics make up 15 percent of the popu-
lation and have overtaken African Americans at 13 percent as the largest ethnic group. African
Americans, however, have seen a dramatic increase of more than 55 percent in their buying power
since 2000.23Asians are 5 percent. Hispanics are the fastest growing minority, and the U.S. Cen-
sus Bureau estimates that by 2050 they will make up 30 percent of the total population. These
three major categories make up more than a third of the U.S. population, that is, roughly one in
every three people are now minorities. All three groups are projected to make up more than half
of the U.S. population in 2050.
Multicultural strategies that recognize these trends have been important for a number of
years, but will dominate the practice of advertising in the midcentury. According to multicultural
analysts, “The U.S. is more multicultural than ever.”24What changes in advertising would you
expect to see as a result of such a dramatic change in the racial profile of the country?
After nearly two years in a recession, the 2009
annual survey found that for the first time in nearly
40 years the foreign-born population declined with
fewer low-skilled immigrants from Mexico and else-
where. However, the survey found continuing in-
creases in high-skilled immigrants from India and
other Asian countries.25 The survey also found that
about one in five U.S. residents spoke a language other
than English at home—mostly in California, New
Mexico, and Texas.26 In three metro areas—Miami,
San Jose, and Los Angeles—more than a third of resi-
dents are foreign born. Data from Synovate’s Diversity

Religion One area that connects culture to demographics is religion. Religion is sometimes a
useful factor because of the increasing importance of product bans. In terms of demographics,
Christianity is the largest religion both in the United States and in the world. Islam is one of the
fastest growing faiths in the world and may soon overtake Christianity in numbers worldwide. As
an indication of that growth, National Public Radio reported that Mohammadhas become the top
male name in England, many European cities, and also in the world.30There is also a large per-
centage of the population, both in the United States and worldwide, that is secular or unaffiliated
with any organized religion.
Some religions forbid certain products. Mormons, for example, avoid tea, coffee, caffeinated
soft drinks, alcohol, and tobacco. Muslims also avoid alcohol and both Muslims and Jews avoid
pork products, as well as other food products that aren’t certified as halal (Muslim) or kosher
(Jewish). Most religions celebrate gift giving, such as some Native American faiths and Chris-
tianity at Christmastime. Other religions affect people’s choice of clothing and adornment. Reli-
gion has also become a huge factor in determining political choices and adherence to certain
causes. It depends on the product category, but religion can be a key factor in identifying those
who are or are not in the market for a good, service, or idea.
CHAPTER 5 • SEGMENTING AND TARGETING THE AUDIENCE 145
Geography Marketers study the sales patterns of different parts of the country because people
residing in different regions need certain products. For example, someone living in the Midwest
or the Northeast is more likely to purchase products for removing snow and ice than a Floridian.
Differences also exist between urban areas and suburban or rural areas. Swimming pools that sell
well in a residential suburban neighborhood would not be in demand in an urban neighborhood
filled with apartment buildings.

Psychographics
Just as demographics relates to social characteristics, psychographics summarizes personal fac-
tors. The term psychographics refers to lifestyle and psychological characteristics, such as ac-
tivities, values, interests, attitudes, and opinions.
Sometimes these complex psychographic factors are more relevant in explaining consumer

even keep their newspapers separate from their trash. One family is into hiking and other outdoor consumers’ interests and

demographics, but in their psychographics—their interests and lifestyles.
Advertisers use psychographics to depict fairly complex consumer patterns. Libraries of
psychographic measures can be purchased from research firms, or a company and its advertising
agency can create its own set of psychographic measures to fit its particular product. These psy-
chographic measures can then be used to describe customers (such as heavy users of gourmet cof-
fee), their response to advertising message strategies (taste comparison ads), or their media
choices (heavy users of the Internet).
Attitudes Anattitudeis a predisposition that reflects an opinion, emotion, or mental state di- Principle
rected at some object, person, or idea. Advertisers are interested in attitudes because of their im- Strategies that are

how consumers evaluate products, institutions, retail stores, and advertising.
One trend that depicts changing attitudes is what Time magazine editor Richard Stengel
called “ethical consumerism,” which refers to consumers who buy according to their conscience,
whether it be a concern for supporting local businesses and ecology and energy efficiency or boy-
cotting wasteful packaging and sweatshops. The Timepoll found that 82 percent said they shop
local and 40 percent said they purchased a product “because they liked the social or political val-
ues of the company that produced it.” At the same time, many companies have found that social
responsibility attracts investments, as well as customer loyalty. Stengel explains, “With global
warming on the minds of many consumers, lots of companies are racing to ‘outgreen’one an-
other.” This results in business practices that build a positive “triple bottom line”: profit, planet,
and people.31
Lifestyles Psychographic analysis looks at lifestyles in terms of patterns of consumption, per-
sonal relationships, interests, and leisure activities. The DDB advertising agency has been con-
ducting lifestyle research annually in the United States since 1975. The agency surveys 5,000 men
and women on nearly 1,000 questions pertaining to such diverse topics as health, financial out-
look, raising kids, shopping, religion, hobbies, leisure activities, household chores, politics, even
their desired self-image. The survey also asks people about the products they use (from soup
to nuts!) and their media habits. This wealth of information makes it possible to paint a vivid,
146 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND
detailed, multidimensional portrait of nearly any consumer segment
that might be of interest to a client—and it also lets the agency spot
changes and trends in people’s lifestyles over time.
Former DDB strategy director Marty Horn says that “DDB be-
lieves that advertising—and all other forms of marketing commu-

advertised and the consumer, and the better we know the consumer

tant source of information that lets this conversation happen. Horn
explains, “The DDB Life Style Survey helps us get a more ‘up close

ventional research alone can provide.”

The VALS™system by research firm SRIC-BI is known for its values and lifestyles system,
which categorizes consumers according to psychological traits that correlate to purchasing be-
haviors. Advertisers correlate these VALS groups with their clients’products and use this infor-
mation to design ads and select media. (Check out this system at www.sric-bi.com/vals.)

The VALS framework enables advertisers to discover which VALS types buy which prod-
ucts so they can select an appropriate target. VALS also describes the communication styles of
each VALS group so the advertiser can design ads using images and copy in a style that will
grab the target group’s attention. In addition, by using GeoVALS™, the advertiser can place
the ad where concentrations of the target live. In addition to the U.S. system, Japan-VALS™
and UK-VALS™have also been developed.
Sociodemographic Segments One common approach to demographic segmentation that has en-
tered mainstream vocabulary comes from referring to people in terms of when they were born.
Although these categories are age driven and we discussed them in an earlier section, these mar-
ket segment terms also refer to lifestyle differences. We’ve talked about the incredible impact
baby boomers have had as a market category, so you can understand their importance as a mar-
ket segment, but savvy marketers recognize the many differences in lifestyles and attitudes
among this huge population. Generations X and Y, as well as the echo boomers, are also impor-
tant demographic segments, but their sociodemographic characteristics may represent more con-
sistent lifestyle differences.
Seniors are also referred to as the gray marketand divided into two categories: young sen-
iors (ages 60 to 74), called the Boomer-Plusgroup,34and older seniors (ages 75 and older). Se-
niors, both younger and older, comprise a huge market, especially in the United States, and also
a wealthy one. As baby boomers move into their retirement years, this senior market will become
even larger relative to the rest of the population.
Other fun terms that have been used to describe demographic and lifestyle segments include
the following:
• DinkiesDouble-income young couples with no kids
• GuppiesGay upwardly mobile professionals
• SkippiesSchool kids with purchasing power
• SlackersArecycled term inspired by the 1991 movie Slacker,referring to teenagers and
young adults who don’t care much or do much
• Bling-Bling GenerationAterm coined by rappers and hip hoppers referring to people with
a high-rolling lifestyle who flash costly jewelry
• RuppiesRetired urban professionals; older consumers with sophisticated tastes and gener-
ally affluent lifestyles.
Behavior
The behavioral component of the think/feel/do model that we discussed in Chapter 4 is a key
strategic factor used in describing the relationship consumers have with a product category or a
brand. That behavioral component, particularly product usage, is often used in segmenting con-
sumers. Arecent behavioral economics study in Sacramento, California, found that when people
were told how much their neighbors save on their electrical bills, this comparative information
motivated them to reduce their energy use as well.35
Behavior, however, is often a product of feelings (impulse) or thoughtful search. One area

Brand Usage and Experiences Acritical behavior predictor called usagerefers to how much of
a product category or brand a customer buys. There are two ways to classify usage: usage rates
and brand relationship, as Table 5.2illustrates. Usage raterefers to quantity of purchase: light,

most difficult for competitors to switch away from a brand. Switchersare people with low lev-
els of brand loyalty who may be willing to try a new brand.
We mentioned in a previous chapter that experience marketing has become an important
idea. You know the old saying that “getting there is half the fun.” The experience of shopping, for
some women, is as important as, or maybe more important than, what they buy. In a larger sense,
our decisions are often based on what our experience has been with the brand—how well it per-
formed, how easy it was to use, how well customer service responded to questions, and so forth.
Innovation and Adoption Another type of behavior has to do with how willing people are to try
something new and how willing they are to risk buying new products. Everett Rogers developed
the classification system which he called the diffusion of innovation curve,to identify innovation
andadoptionbehaviors. This adoption processis identified in terms of personal behavior and
how the behavior reflects the speed with which people are willing to try something new, such as
innovators,early adopters,early majority,late majority,andlaggards.37This system is directly
related to the willingness of people to try new products, which reflects the speed of diffusionof
new ideas. See Figure 5.6for an interpretation of Rogers’Diffusion of Innovation model.
The innovator category, which is the group of brave souls willing to try something new, rep-
resents only about 2.5 percent of the population. Obviously this group and the early adopter cat-
egory are important groups for marketers launching new products. Risk taking is a personality
characteristic, but it drives behavior in the area of trying a new product. Perceived riskis your
view of the relationship between what you gain by trying something new and what you have to
lose if it doesn’t work out. In other words, how important is the consequence of not making a good
decision? Price is a huge barrier for high-involvement products; personal status and self-image
may be a risk barrier for a fashion product.
Early adopters have been studied by SRI International, the consulting company behind the
VALS segmentation scheme. Its clients often ask for guidance about identifying early adopters of
innovative products. Cheri Anderson, an SRI consultant, explains the company has discovered
that early adopters:
• Are people involved in unusual activities and whose level of activity will disproportionately
affect the behaviors of others
• Have many weak social contacts
• Are masters of their own universes
• Are high media users
• Have a more complex history of personal and sexual relationships
Who are these people? SRI’s research has found that “contrary to popular belief, there is no
one innovator or early adopter group but adoption patterns vary with the product category. Early
adopters are in different strata and roles in society and cannot be identified by demographics

The Diffusion of Innovation
This version of Rogers' diffusion of Innovation model shows the usual bell curve with data estimating the percentage of people in the standard adaption
categories, however, it also presents a percentage line that estimates the cumulative effect of successive groups of consumers adopting a new idea until it
eventually reaches a saturation level.

alone. Anderson explains why early adopters are important to research firms such as SRI: “By un-
derstanding what motivates and de-motivates different early adopter groups, we can help our
clients identify targets and steer their brands for successful market entry.”
Trends and Fads The phenomenon of trends and fads is related to lifestyle and psychographic
factors, as well as the fascination with choice in a consumer culture. We’ve seen “acre homes”
and fancy bathroom retreats, as well as low-carb diets, healthy food (oat bran, antioxidants), nat-
ural products, fitness fads and personal trainers, hybrid cars, carbon trading, simple life (don’t buy
things), and local products (don’t buy things that use a lot of gas in transportation to get to your
local store). Even Girl Scout cookies are trying to appeal to people by using new formulations
that are low in trans fats.38
Young people are particularly involved in trends. For example, the way teenagers dress and
talk and the products they buy are driven by a continuing search for coolness. Trend spottersare
professional researchers hired by advertisers to identify trends that may affect consumer behav-
ior. Cool huntersare trend spotters who specialize in identifying trendy fads that appeal to young
people. They usually work with panels of young people in key trendsetting locations, such as New
York, California, urban streets, and Japan. Loic Bizel, for example, hunts Japanese super trendy
fads as a consultant for many Western companies and designers. Through his website
(www.fashioninjapan.com), you can get a taste of those cool ideas and fashion in Japan’s streets
and life, such as studded high tops and spray-on stockings.
CONSUMER DECISION MAKING
Another important factor in identifying a brand’s potential customers is the way consumers go
about making product choices. Acomplicating factor is the increasing number of choices. Brand
variations clutter shelves and media choices seem unlimited. Chicago agency Brandtrust believes
the consumer decision process is “a complex alchemy” set in play by product features plus con-
sumers’past experiences with shopping in the product category.39
CHAPTER 5 • SEGMENTING AND TARGETING THE AUDIENCE 151
In Chapter 4we looked at a number of models from a marketer’s point of view. Now let’s
examine them from the consumer’s perspective. The traditional view of consumer decision mak-
ing, which is similar to the more classic AIDA-based models of message impact, is based on a
linear, information-processing approach. It suggests that most people follow a decision process
with fairly predictable steps: (1) need recognition, (2) information search, (3) evaluation of alter-
natives, (4) purchase decision, and (5) post-purchase evaluation.
• Need recognitioncan vary in terms of seriousness or importance. The goal of advertising at
this stage is to activate or stimulate this need.
• Information searchcan be casual (reading ads and articles that happen to catch your atten-
tion) or formal (searching for information in publications such as Consumer Reports). Ad-
vertising helps the search process by providing information that is easy to find and
remember. For low-involvement products this stage may not occupy much time or thought
or it may be skipped altogether. Another way to describe consumer behavior in terms of in-
formation needs includes such terms as searchersandimpulse buyers.Searchers are driven
by a need to know everything they can about a product before making a purchase, particu-
larly major purchases. In contrast, people who buy on impulse generally do so without much
thought based on some immediate desire such as thirst or hunger. Usually there’s not much
at stake, so the risk of making a bad decision is much lower. It is true, however, that even
major purchases, such as cars, can be made on the spur of the moment by people who are
not dedicated searchers for information.
• Evaluation of alternativesis the stage where consumers compare various products and fea-
tures and reduce the list of options to a manageable number. They select certain features that
are important and use them to judge alternatives. Advertising is important in this evaluation
process because it helps sort out products on the basis of tangible and intangible features.
Even with low-involvement products, there may be what we call an evoked setof brands
that are all considered permissible. What are your favorite candy bars? The brands you name
makes up your evoked set.
• Purchase decisionis often a two-part decision. Usually, we select the brand first and then
select the outlet from which to buy it. Is this product available at a grocery store, a discount
store, a hardware store, a boutique, a department store, or a specialty
store? Sometimes we select the outlet first, particularly with impulse

Giventheimportanceofinvolvement,let’sreconsidertheclassicinformationapproachtobrand
decisions.InChapter4weintroducedthethink/feel/domodelofconsumerresponsetoamessage.
Thatsamemodelisusefulinanalyzingthemanydifferentwaysconsumersmakebranddecisions.
The idea is that the path to a decision depends on the type of product and the buying situa-
tion. If you’re hungry (a feeling drives a purchase decision), you grab a candy bar without much
information search. If you try a sample product and like it (behavior is the driver), then you may
buy the product without much evaluation of alternatives. In other words, not all responses begin
with thinking about a product, nor do they follow the same route to a decision. Table 5.3illus-
trates the many ways a purchase decision can be made.
Given all of the different ways consumers go about making a brand choice, you can see why
brand planners need to know how this decision process works for a specific product category. Ob-
viously the message would be different for a consumer who is searching for information to buy a
computer and considering the differences between brands in comparison to someone who makes
an impulse purchase like buying a soft drink. That’s why this information becomes an important
part of a consumer profile when identifying prospects to target in a campaign.
Influences on B2B Decision Making Many of the influences that affect consumer buying also are
reflected in business-to-business marketing. However, we also know that B2B decision making
generally follows the informational route. Emotion may still be important in certain situations
(e.g., the buyer wants to impress the boss), but ultimately these decisions usually are more rational
than emotional for the following reasons:
• In organizational buying, many individuals are involved in reviewing the options, often with
a buying committee making the final decision.
• Although the business buyer may be motivated by both rational and emotional factors, the
use of rational and quantitative criteria dominates most decisions.
• The decision is sometimes made based on a set of specifications to potential suppliers who
then bid on the contract. Typically in these purchases, the lowest bid wins.
• The decision may span a considerable time period and create a lag between the initial con-
tact and final decision. On the other hand, once a decision is made, it may be in place for a
long time and sometimes is supported by a contract.
• Qualityishugelyimportant,andrepeatpurchasesarebasedonhowwelltheproductperforms.
• Personal selling is also important in B2B marketing, so advertising is used to open the door
and generate leads for the sales force.
TARGETING THE RIGHT AUDIENCE
Traditionally a market is first divided to identify segments, and then potentially profitable seg-
ments are selected to be the target audience for a marketing communication effort. Through
targeting,the organization can design specific communication strategies to match the audience’s
needs and wants and position the product in the most relevant way to match their interests. Tar-
geting is also the key factor in selecting the right media.
CHAPTER 5 • SEGMENTING AND TARGETING THE AUDIENCE 153
Consider, for example, how Niman Ranch of Bolinas, California, built a luxury brand for its
beef. The obvious target would be upscale consumers who value natural food and are willing to
pay more for the best. But that’s not the route Niman Ranch took. Instead it bypassed consumers
and marketed directly to prestigious chefs whose restaurants featured the brand on their menus.
By using an innovative targeting strategy, Niman moved from commodity to a cachet brand that
has brought huge growth to the little company. More recently with the interest in organic prod-
ucts and local farming, Niman has become a model for knitting together a network of hundreds
of small-scale, organic farmers that leverages economies of scale, while at the same time leaving
farmers in control of their local operations.40

An example of how consumers can be profiled comes from Forrester Research, which uses
a research approach called “design personas.” Harley Manning, research director for customer
experience, describes the concept as “a model of a customer’s goals, needs, attitudes, and behav-
iors distilled from interviewing and observing real people in a market segment.” He explains that
when you build a “persona,” you have a vivid profile of a type of person. For example, he referred
to “Stanley,” a person used by J.P. Morgan to model its active, savvy investors. He notes that this
type of person won’t be satisfied with a simple account summary and instead wants advanced
portfolio details.

that a person who is only known by an ISPnumber gets a specially targeted ad based on sites vis-

As David Rittenhouse, of Ogilvy & Mather, explains, “Online media have emerged as a
preferred channel for behavioral targeting due to the massive amount of data available on Web
users’browsing patterns and the dynamic nature of the way ads are delivered.” He makes the
point in The Inside Storythat this has opened up new opportunities for marketers to use better
targeted and more cost-efficient and relevant messages. Check out his digital agency,

Microtargeting
Atargeting practice that has emerged from political campaigning is called microtargeting,which
refers to using vast computer databanks of personal information to identify voters most likely to
support one candidate or another. This data miningpractice, which enables advertisers to direct
highly tailored marketing messages to narrow slices of a segment, was refined for George Bush’s
2004 reelection campaign and used again in the midterm elections by California Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger, as well as other candidates, both Democrat and Republican, in the 2008 elec-
tion. From these data banks, political experts can tell what car or cars likely voters will drive, as
well as their choices in recreation, leisure time activities, and restaurants.
Microtargeting has applications beyond politics. Several marketers have been able to profile
prospects by carefully analyzing data on their regular customers to identify these revealing ten-
dencies and characteristics.
But sometimes it doesn’t work. An example of what sounded like a good idea at microtarget-
ing comes from Chevrolet’s “Come Together and Worship,” a 16-concert tour with top Christian-
music performers. The idea was that the Christian-music psychographic reflected a segment of

Ethical Issues
In addition to the privacy issue raised in The Inside Story,other ethical issues are involved with
segmenting and targeting. Let’s consider two examples of ethical quandaries surrounding the ad-
vertising of potentially unhealthy products to specific segments, such as targeting young black
men in inner cities with malt beer ads and children with commercials for sugary foods.
One of the biggest issues in targeting is the emphasis in many advertising programs on tar-
geting young consumers. It started back in the 1950s and ever since then, marketers and adver-
tisers have tried to reach the trendsetting youthful audience. But the growth in the numbers of
older consumers has led to some resentment about the continuing emphasis on young people as
a general targeting strategy. It’s a particular problem in television programming, most of which

Reconnecting with a valuable segment of the target audience helped Old Navy improve its fortunes. At-
tracting value-conscious moms seems to be paying off. As a result of improving the clothing lines, stores,
and merchandising and promotional strategies, the brand was able to build and maintain its strong value mes-
sage, which translated into sales.
The Gap, Old Navy’s parent company, posted a 45 percent profit increase in the fourth quarter of 2009,
thanks in large part to Old Navy success. Sales at the Old Navy stores that have been open at least a year rose
7 percent.
A key insight about the target audience and a clever campaign using some quirky mannequins that talk
helped Old Navy create positive brand perception in the eyes of the target audience: young moms. Old Navy
sells more than inexpensive, cool clothes at a good price. Its brand sells fun. Old Navy’s President Tom
Wyatt said, “There are a lot of people that portray value, but no one portrays value with our quirky spirit.”
A J.D. Power study revealed another sign of brand effectiveness. The study evaluated favorable online
mentions of retailers by 22- to 29-year-olds and found that value brand Old Navy closely followed some more
trendy brands, such as Anthropologie and Bath & Body Works.
Old Navy is starting to receive recognition for its creative work, as well. The National Retail Federation
asked more than 9,900 consumers across the nation to name their favorite holiday campaign. “Super-
Modelquins” ranked high at number six.

CHAPTER KEY POINTS
1. What are the basic types of strategic research and how are they used?
2. What are the most common research methods used in advertising?
3. What are the key challenges facing advertising researchers?
Cheesy Fun. It’s Not Just for Kids.
What do you think of when you think of Cheetos? The crunch and maybe
orange fingers? A product that’s been marketed to kids for its 60-year
history, Cheetos is a brand long-associated with fun.
But it wasn’t so funny when competitors Goldfish and Cheez-It started
spending double the amount that Cheetos did on media.
The competitive problem was complicated by some social responsibility is-
sues. Growing concerns about childhood obesity and the ethical concern of mar-
keting to kids were serious challenges to Pepsico/Frito Lay, which is Cheetos’
parent company. A commitment to be socially responsible led Pepsico to vol-
untarily sign the Children’s Food & Beverage Advertising Initiative in 2007, which
restricted advertising of not-so-healthy foods to children under age 12.
The result? Cheetos chose to abandon its position as a favorite kids’ snack
and target a new audience. That’s a scary new strategy for any brand. It started
its quest to find a new direction by setting specific objectives to help focus its
research efforts:
1. Discover if an alternate adult target could be identified for Cheetos.
2. DevelopabetterunderstandingoftheCheetos’consumptionexperience.
3. Understand the overlaps between kids and the new adult target so that ex-
isting brand equities could be carried forward.
4. Develop and evaluate compelling new message strategies for the new target
audience.
Findings from this research might surprise you. Even though Cheetos had
been marketed as a children’s snack, adults ate them too. Several studies re-
vealed fascinating insights that eventually led to a new campaign for adults.
One study investigated attitudes of adults and children (ages 10 to 13) who
claimed to be Cheetos brand lovers. Interestingly, both the adults and the kids
communicated feelings of stress. A key insight from the research revealed that
the playfulness associated with Cheetos could help these consumers escape
some of their daily pressures.
161
162 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND
Researchers also listened to what Cheetos fans said about the experience of
eating Cheetos and watched how they acted when they ate Cheetos. Group mem-
bers loved eating them and licking their fingers as if to say they were looking for
permissionnotto act their age or conform to expected adult behavior.
Cheetos spokes-animal Chester Cheetah related well to kids. But would he ap-
peal to adults? To test this idea, someone dressed up in a Chester Cheetah cos-
tume and walked the hot spots in San Francisco. Grown adults embraced the
mascot by hugging and posing for pictures with him, proving this icon was up to
the job no matter what the age of the Cheetos’ fan.
Another study asked 1,000 adults about their attitudes to play. The respon-
dents answered questions about when they played hooky from work and when
they last skinny dipped and so on. Findings from this survey were telling. About half
of those labeled “very playful” were most likely to eat a lot of Cheetos, and the
“least playful” were also least likely to consume the product.
From literature on cultural trends, the agency was able to define an emerging
group of people who were likely to be passionate for Cheetos. A book by Christo-
pher Noxon1 identified a new breed of adults called “rejuveniles.” These are the
folks who think playing isn’t just for kids. Yankelovich, a leading consumer research
firm, confirmed the emerging trend of adults who liked being just a tad naughty
and child-like regardless of their age. These people identified with brands such as
Disney, Wii, Lego, and, not surprisingly, Cheetos.
Cheetos’ agency, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners synthesized information from
these research efforts and came up with a Big Idea. The new adult target, “rejuve-
niles,” could “bend the rules with mischievous fun.” The tone of the campaign was
edgy fun for adults rather than the sweet fun that had been used for kids. The big
idea played out in a campaign that might not appeal to everyone, but it sure did
to the target audience. Three TV spots illustrated how the inner child could be re-
leased with pranks involving Cheetos. One spot featured a woman at a laundromat
who’d been berated by another woman. To get revenge and encouraged by mas-
cot Chester Cheetah, the young woman put a bag of orange Cheetos in the other
woman’s white load of wash.
The online component of the campaign, OrangeUnderground.com, encour-
aged adults to play mischievous pranks with the orange snacks by creating Ran-
dom Acts of Cheetos. The only rule: the pranks had to be “benign and harmless,
never malicious or hurtful.” Cheetos partnered with Comedy Central for a promo-
tion that encouraged fans to make mischief, video it, and post it to the website.
The interactive website itself features oddball humor with games, the Legend of
Cheetocorn, a giant Cheetos pet, and all sorts of crazy stuff.

CHAPTER 6 • STRATEGIC RESEARCH 163
In our previous chapters on how to plan marketing communication that has a real impact on con-
sumers, we noted that marketers such as Frito-Lay need to do brand, market, and consumer re-
search. This research effort becomes the foundation for objective setting, segmenting the
market and targeting the audience, and developing the brand communication plan. So now that
we understand the need for research, let’s talk about how to do it. This chapter presents some key
research concepts, beginning with an explanation of the two most basic categories of research,
primary and secondary; the basic categories of research tools, quantitative and qualitative; and
the most common research methods used in planning marketing communication. We also discuss
the key challenges facing advertising researchers.
HOW DO YOU FIND CONSUMER INSIGHTS?
In the previous chapter we talked about insight—in fact, an effective marketing communication
program is totally dependent on consumer insight. Know your customer—and listening is the first
step in understanding customers.
Whatdoesthatmean?Itmeansthatbrandstrategybeginswithconsumerresearch—thetools

stand the principles and practices of advertising research and how to listen effectively to
consumers.
In-house researchers or independent research companies hired from outside the company
usually handle a client’s market and consumer research. The objective at all stages of the plan-
ning process is to answer the question: What do we need to know in order to make an informed
decision? Here are the various types of research used in planning advertising and marketing com-
munication, such as the Cheetos campaign:
• Market researchcompiles information about the product, the product category, competitors,
and other details of the marketing environment that will affect the development of advertis-
ing strategy.
• Consumer researchidentifies people who are in the market for the product in terms of
their characteristics, attitudes, interests, and motivations. Ultimately, this information is
used to decide who the targeted audience for the advertising should be. In an integrated
marketing communication (IMC) plan, the consumer research also acquires information
about all the relevant stakeholders and their points of contact with the brand.
• Advertising researchfocuses on all elements of adver-
tising, including message development research, media
planning research, evaluation, and information about
competitors’advertising. IMC researchis similar, ex-
cept that it is used to assemble information needed in
planning the use of a variety of marketing communica-
tion tools. IMC is particularly concerned with the inter-
action of multiple messages from a variety of sources to
present the brand consistently.
• Strategic researchuncovers critical information that be-
comes the basis for strategic planning decisions for both
marketing and marketing communication. In advertising,
this type of research covers all of the factors and steps that
lead to the creation of message strategies and media plans.
Think of strategic research as collecting all relevant back-
ground information needed to make a decision on advertis-
ing and marketing communication strategy. The importance
of finding an adult target audience who appreciated hav-
ing fun was important to the Cheetos campaign. Knowledge about consumers’ needs and wants is at the
heart of all marketing communication plans. The

market research (what information is avail-
able?), strategic research (what factors are most
important in making a decision and how do the
schools stack up?), and evaluative research
(how will I know I made the best decision?). An
advertising plan goes through similar stages of
development with research as the first step.
What Are the Basic Types
of Research?
New advertising assignments always begin
with some kind of informal or formal back-
ground research into the marketing situation.
This is called secondary research, and we’ll
compare it with primary research, which is
original research conducted by the company or
brand.

in Christopher Noxon’s book—underscores the importance of reading widely.
Here are a few of the more traditional sources of secondary information that are available to
advertisers doing backgrounding:
• Government OrganizationsGovernments, through their various departments, provide an as-
tonishing array of statistics that can greatly enhance advertising and marketing decisions.
Many of the statistics come from census records on the population’s size, geographic distri-
bution, age, income, occupation, education, and ethnicity. As we explained in Chapter 5,
U.S. Census Bureau demographic information of this kind is fundamental to decision mak-
ing about advertising targets and market segmentation. An advertiser cannot aim its advertis-
ing at a target audience without knowing that audience’s size and major dimensions. In
addition to census information, other government agencies generate reports that help adver-
tisers make better decisions, such as the Survey of Current Businessfrom the U.S. Depart-
ment of Commerce (www.bea.gov/scb).
• TradeAssociationsManyindustriessupporttradeassociations—professionalorganizations

• Secondary Research SuppliersBecause of the overwhelming amount of information avail-
able through secondary research, specialized suppliers gather and organize that information
around specific topic areas for other interested parties. Key secondary research suppliers are
FIND/SVP, Off-the-Shelf Publications, Dialog Information Services, Lexis-Nexis, and Dow
Jones’Factiva.
CHAPTER 6 • STRATEGIC RESEARCH 165
• Secondary Information on the InternetFor any given company, you’re bound
to find a website where you can learn about the company’s history and philos-
ophy of doing business, check out its complete product line, and discover who
runs the company. These sites offer credible information for account planners
and others involved in market research. Other sources of Internet information
are blog sites and chat rooms where you can learn about people’s reactions to
brands and products. There are also many industry-related sites for marketing
that report on research, essays, and best practices:
BrandEra (www.brandera.com) offers information by product category.
MarketPerceptions (http://marketperceptions.com) represents a research com-
pany that specializes in health care research. The site has information about
its focus group capabilities.
Forrester Research (www.forrester.com)providesindustryresearchintotech-
nologymarkets.
Greenbook.org (www.greenbook.org) is a worldwide directory of marketing
research focus group suppliers.
Cluetrain (www.cluetrain.com) publishes new ways to find and share innova-
tive marketing information and ideas.
Primary Research Information that is collected for the first time from original
sources is called primary research. To obtain primary research, companies and
their agencies do their own tracking and monitoring of their customers’behavior.

Many advertising agencies subscribe to large-scale surveys conducted by the
with tender chickens.
Simmons Market Research Bureau (SMRB) or by Mediamark Research, Inc. (MRI).
These two organizations survey large samples of American consumers (approxi-
mately 30,000 for each survey) and ask questions about the consumption, possession, or use of a
wide range of products, services, and media. The products and services covered in the MRI survey
range from toothbrushes and dental floss to diet colas, camping equipment, and theme parks.
Both SMRB and MRI conduct original research and distribute their findings to their clients.
The resulting reports are intended primarily for use in media planning, but because these surveys
are so comprehensive, they also can be mined for unique consumer information. Through a com-
puter program called Golddigger, for example, an MRI subscriber can select a consumer target
and ask the computer to find all other products and services and all of the media that members
of the target segment use. This profile provides a vivid and detailed description of the target as
a person—just the information creative teams need to help them envision their audiences. To give
you an idea of what the media data look like, check out Figure 6.1for a sample MRI report of the
types of TVprograms adults ages 18 to 34 watch.

MRI Consumer Media Report
This MRI report breaks down the 18–34 age market into four market segments based on size of household and age of children, if any, and describes
their television viewing patterns. Here’s a question: Where would you advertise to reach single adults in the 18–34 category? First look at the Index
column under that category heading and find the two highest percentages. Then, for each high rating, look across to column Aand determine the size
of that group. As a point of comparison, do the same analysis for the Married with the Youngest Child over 6 category. How do the two groups differ
in the television viewing patterns?

• What do our customers think about our advertising?
• How do consumers relate to the brand? What are their emotional links to the brand?
Qualitative methods often are used early in the process of developing a brand communica-
tion plan or message strategy for generating insights, as well as questions and hypotheses for ad-
ditional research. They are also good at confirming hunches, ruling out bad approaches and
questionable or confusing ideas, and giving direction to the message strategy. However, because
qualitative research is typically done with small groups, researchers cannot project their findings
to the larger population.
Rather than drawing conclusions, qualitative research is used to answer the question why, as
well as generate hypotheses that can be tested with quantitative methods.3As Sally Reinman,
worldwide market planner at Saatchi & Saatchi, wrote for this book, research is more than num-
bers. She explains:
Research processes are more varied and exciting than ever before. Examples include ask-
ing consumers to draw pictures, create collages, and produce home videos to show how
they use a product.
As consumers around the world become better informed and more demanding, adver-
tisers that target different cultures need to find the “commonalities” (or common ground)
among consumer groups from these cultures. Research for Toyota’s sports-utility vehicle
(SUV), the RAV4, showed that consumers in all the targeted countries had three common
desires: They wanted an SUVto have style, safety, and economy.
To find these commonalities, I work with experts to learn the cultural meaning of codes
and symbols that people use to communicate. The experts I work with include cultural and

Do your professors and instructors talk about the research they conduct? Here’s an example
of one professor’s research about cigarette advertising that has practical implications for the to-

Market Information Formal research used by the marketing department for strategic planning
is called marketing research. It includes surveys, in-depth interviews, observational methods,
focus groups (which are like in-depth interviews with a group rather than individuals), and all
types of primary and secondary data used to develop a marketing plan and ultimately provide in-
formation for a brand communication plan. Asubset of marketing research, market researchis re-
search used to gather information about a particular market.
An example comes from Iceland, a country hard hit by the global economic downturn that
started in 2007. As explained by Ingvi Logason, principal in his own advertising firm in Reyk-
javik, “Iceland, with its overexpanded banking sector, was hit worse than any other Westernized
country.” With all of its banks except one going into bankruptcy or only barely being saved by
serious rescue activities by the government, national debt outweighed gross national production
by 2 to 1. Iceland was on the brink of national bankruptcy. The Inside Storydetails how Logason
and his agency guided his client, the lamb industry, through this difficult time.
Market information includes everything a planner can uncover about consumer perceptions
of the brand, product category, and competitors’brands. Planners sometimes ride with the sales
force and listen to sales pitches, tour manufacturing plants to see how a product is made, and work
in a store or restaurant to evaluate employee interaction with customers. In terms of marketing
communication, planners test the brand’s and its competitors’advertisements, promotions, retail
displays, packaging, and other marketing communication efforts.
Brand information includes an assessment of the brand’s role and performance in the
marketplace—is it a leader, a follower, a challenger, or a subbrand of a bigger and better
known brand? This research also investigates how people perceive brand personalities and
images. Here are some common methods used to gather information about a brand and the
marketplace:
• The Brand ExperienceWhen an agency gets a new client, the first thing the agency team
has to do is learn about the brand through brand research. That means learning where the
brand has been in the past in terms of the market, its customers, and competitors, as the
Cheetos campaign demonstrated. Also important is eliciting the corporate point of view re-
garding the brand’s position within the company’s line of products, as well as corporate
goals and plans for the brand. Another critical area of brand research is the brand’s relation-
ships with its customers. Researchers, for example, may go through all of the experiences

THE INSIDE STORY
How the Lamb Industry in Iceland
Survived the Economic Downturn
Ingvi Logason,Principal, H:N Marketing Communication, Reykjavik, Iceland
In 2009 (when this was written) the
whole world was facing proba-
bly its greatest economic crisis
since the early 20th century.
This recession hit the Icelandic
public suddenly and it hit
hard—obliterating purchasing
power. Overnight the situation
changed the way Icelanders
search and shop, as well as what
they want from their brands. In this
market planners had to truly understand the
role a brand plays in the lives of its target audience clar-
ifying “what’s in it for me” in all communication.
One brand that my marketing communication firm
has handled and had to adapt to the changed market is
Icelandic Lamb. Traditionally lamb had been around a
29 percent share of Icelandic meat consumption with
heavy and almost exclusive emphasis on the prime (and
more expensive) parts of the lamb. That left farmers with
a high percentage of the lamb unsold. Now lamb was
down to a 26 percent share and falling.
Anyone could see that this was not a good situation
with the sharp decrease in purchasing power leading to
fewer sales in luxury and expensive food items. Further-
more, sales figures showed that consumers were not go-
ing for the less expensive cuts of lamb, but rather opting
for other cheaper meat products. Although we were
quick to catch the trend and see the possible sales de-
cline, we were not sure why sales hadn’t moved to less
expensive lamb cuts.
We assembled focus groups to determine the un-

lem became clear: consumers simply did not know how
to prepare the less costly parts—it was a forgotten art.

for our target group to increase their consumption of
less costly meat than learn new recipes. Our extensive

buying is also a form of commitment to the client: the parking lots of agencies that have au-

• Marketing Communication AuditEither formally or informally, most planners will begin an
assignment by collecting every possible piece of advertising and other forms of marketing
communication by the brand, as well as its competitors and other relevant categories that
may have lessons for the brand. Often these pieces are attached to the walls in a “war room”
where team members can immerse themselves in messages to stimulate new ideas. This in-

We mentioned in the discussion of the communication role of marketing communication that
feedback can be obtained from customers as a part of a research program that uses customer con-
tact as an information source—systematically recording information from customer service, tech-
nical service, inbound telemarketing calls, and online sites. Some businesses use the Internet to
involve customers in making decisions about product design, distribution, price, and company
operations using online surveys, blogs, online communities, and other social media.

as the why nots. Researchers often try to uncover the whys of the buys,but insight research may also uncover
reasons why people don’t want to try or buy a product. For example, Dunkin’Donuts found in its
consumer research several reasons why its customers were uncomfortable ordering fancy coffee
drinks. Mostly they were intimidated by the whole “barista” thing and the fancy coffee names.
The DDB agency regularly conducts “Barriers to Purchase” research5realizing that these
barriers often create an opportunity for advertising messages to present information or change
perceptions. The American Dairy Association, for example, asked DDB to find out why cheese
consumption was declining. A study identified one barrier that was most easily correctable
through a marketing communication effort: the absence of simple cheese recipes for home
cooks. Ads and the association’s website (www.ilovecheese.com) offer many such recipes.
Emotions are elicited by asking consumers what they think people in various photos and sit-
uations are feeling. Associations are investigated by asking people what comes to mind when a
word or brand is mentioned. In association tests,people are asked what they think of when they
hear a cue, such as the name of a product category or a brand. They respond with all of the things
that come to mind, and, as we have said, that forms a network of associations.Brand perceptions
are tested this way to map the structure and logic of these association networks, which lead to
message strategies. For example, what do you think of when you think of Taco Bell? Wendy’s?
Arby’s? Each restaurant should bring to mind some
things in common (fast food, cheap food), but they also
have distinct networks of associations based on type of
food (Mexican, hamburgers, roast beef), restaurant de-
sign, logo and colors, brand characters, healthfulness,
and so forth. Each restaurant, then, has a distinctive
profile that can be determined from this network of as-
sociations.

cluded color coding the different varieties; depict steam to make the soup in the picture look
warm; remove the spoon, which consumers said served no purpose; update the look of the bowl;

Media Research Media planning begins with consumer research and questions about media be-
havior that help with the media selection decision. Media planners often work in conjunction with
the information account planners uncover to decide which media formats make the most sense to
accomplish the objectives. The goal is to activate consumer interest by reaching them through
some medium that engages their interest.
Next, media research gathers information about all the possible media and marketing

earlier in Figure 6.1 illustrates the type of information media researchers consult to develop
recommendations.
Message Development Research As planners, account managers, and people on the creative
team begin to develop a message strategy, they involve themselves in various types of informal
and formal message development research.They read all of the relevant secondary information
provided by the client and the planners to become better informed about the brand, the company,
the competition, the media, and the product category. As Jackie Boulter,7head of planning at the
London-based Abbott Mead Vickers-BBDO agency, explained, creative development research is
focused on refining message ideas prior to production. It uses qualitative research to predict if the
idea will solve the business problem and achieve the objectives.
Sometimes called concept testing,it can help evaluate the relative power of various creative
ideas. It’s a “work-in-progress” type of evaluation. The idea is to test the big idea that communi-
cates the strategy behind the message—or various types of executionsof the concept. These in-
terviews are often conducted in malls and downtown areas where there are lots of people who can
be asked to look at a rough sketch of the idea or ad and respond to it. They can also be conducted
over the phone, by mail, or online.
As writers and art directors begin working on a specific creative project, they almost always
conduct informal research of their own. They may do their own personal observational research
and visit retail stores, talk to salespeople, and watch customers buy. They may visit the agency
information center or library, browse through reference books, and borrow subject and picture
files. They will look at previous advertising, especially that of competitors, to see what others
have done, and in their hearts they will become convinced that they can create something better
than, and different from, anything that has been done before. This informal, personal research has
a powerful influence on what happens later in the message development process.
Another technique used to analyze the meaning of communication is semiotic analysis,
which is a way to take apart the signs and symbols in a message to uncover layers and types of
meanings. The objective is to find deeper meanings in the symbolism that might be particular to
different groups of consumers. Its focus is on determining the meanings, even if they are not ob-
vious or highly symbolic, that might relate to consumer motivations.
For example, the advertising that launched General Motors’ OnStar global positioning
system (GPS) used a Batman theme. By looking at this commercial in terms of its signs and
symbols,itwaspossibletodetermineiftheobvious,aswellashidden,meaningsofthemes-

Evaluative research,often referred to as copytesting,is done during a campaign and after-
ward. If it’s used during a campaign, the objective is to adjust the ad to make it stronger. After-
ward, the research determines the effectiveness of the ad or campaign.
We will explore many different types of evaluation methods in Chapter 19, but let’s just men-
tion two common forms here. Memory can be measured using aided recognition(or recall). A
researcher might page through a magazine (or use some other medium) and ask respondents
whether they remember seeing a particular ad. Unaided recognition (or recall) means respon-
dents are asked to tell what they remember without being prompted by seeing the magazine (or
other medium) to refresh their memories. These tools are used both in developmental research
and also in evaluation. Strategic, developmental, and evaluative research share some common
tools and processes and we briefly describe some of these in the following section.
WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON RESEARCH METHODS?
This section focuses on the types of research used in message development and the research sit-
uations where these methods are typically used.
Ways of Contact: Quantitative Methods
Consumer research methodologies are often described in terms of the ways researchers contact
their respondents. The contact can be in person, by telephone, by mail, through the Internet or ca-
ble TV, or by a computer kiosk in a mall or store. Most quantitative research in marketing com-
munication is survey based, however, consumers can also be contacted in malls where they are
invited to participate in experimental research.

and attitudes.
Sampling is used because in most cases, it is cost prohibitive to try to interview everyone in
the population or target market. Instead the people interviewed are a representative sampleof the
larger group, a subset of the population that is representative of the entire population.9For survey
research to be an accurate reflection of the population, those who participate must be selected at ran-
dom, which means every person who belongs to the population being surveyed has an equal likeli-
hood (probability) of being chosen to participate. For a classic example of how nonrandom sampling
can create inaccurate results, consider the Literary Digestpresidential election polling of Landon
versus Roosevelt in 1936, which produced incorrect results for the presidential election, even
though it had a sample size of more than 2 million households. Why? Analysis of the poll results in-
dicates that both the magazine’s sample and the response were biased and did not accurately predict
voter behavior.10
Incentives are important when doing surveys. As Karl Weiss, a member of this book’s Ad-
visory Board and president of a marketing research company explains, choose an incentive that

is appropriate for your audience—perhaps $5 or $10 in cash, a drawing for a Wii or iPhone, or
even a summary of the results. Different audiences have different interests so make your incen-
tive appealing to them. Be careful, however, not to bias your results in the process. If you are
studying airline travel behavior and your incentive is a PlayStation, don’t be surprised to find that
most of those who complete the survey are males under 35 years old.
Since survey research first began, the way researchers have gone about collecting data from
respondents has seen almost constant change as new technologies have made such research more
cost efficient:
• Door-to-Door InterviewsIn the 1950s and 1960s, marketing researchers literally roamed the
streets knocking on people’s doors with clipboards in hand in order to gather their survey
data. Following complex sampling strategies, they made their way through everything from
apartment buildings to rural farm areas, with their sampling road map designed to maximize
the randomness and representativeness of the population they studied. It wasn’t surprising to
see this laborious and oftentimes even dangerous approach to collecting survey data re-
placed by telephone interviewing by the 1970s.
• Phone InterviewsAs access to telephones increased after World War II, calling soon became
the survey mode of choice, as it was much less expensive and far less invasive than sending
interviewers out to people’s homes. The listing of phone numbers in phone directories gave
researchers the perfect source from which they could draw a random sample,which means
each person in the population has an equal chance of being selected to be in the sample. Al-
though telephone interviewing was more practical than going from door to door, researchers
lost the ability to interact directly with their participants when communicating just by tele-
phone, especially when there was a need to show pictures or samples of what they were
evaluating. However, telephone surveys were not only more cost effective but necessary as
people stopped answering their doors due to solicitation efforts (door-to-door sales were
very common at that time) and concerns over personal safety.
But over time, telephone interviewing too faced its challenges. In the late 1980s and
early 1990s, telemarketing efforts became so pervasive that consumers sought ways to make
it stop, from the use of call-screening devices such as answering machines and Caller ID to
signing up on the National Do Not Call Registry, which put legal ramifications behind unso-
licited phone calls. Although marketing research calls were exempt from this legislation, be-
cause nothing is being sold, research calls were screened out with the rest as consumers
fortified their privacy efforts. Today it is not uncommon for up to 60 percent of households
176 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND
to not answer their phones when called for a survey. Just as door-to-door surveying met its
end as more cost-effective and acceptable alternatives became available, researchers once
again need to look for new alternatives for gathering survey data.
• Mail SurveysAs household addresses became readily available after the Second World War,
mail surveys increased in use because researchers could pull addresses from city directories.
Specialized research companies sold lists of addresses to direct marketers and these lists also
were used by researchers. Mail surveys were popular because they didn’t use live interview-
ers and thus were even less expensive than telephone surveys. In terms of survey design, the
mail surveys have to be extremely easy to understand and all of the questions need to be
carefully tested because an interviewer won’t be present to clarify respondents’questions.
Many variables determine the response rate, such as the interest level of the topic to the re-
spondent, personalization of the message, the quality of the paper, the design of the enve-
lope, and the inclusion of a prepaid return envelope. In spite of all the testing that has been
done on mail survey design, the problem continues to be a low return rate, in addition to the
loss of direct contact with the respondent.
• Internet SurveysToday, the world of data collection is changing again. Landline telephones
are on the decline as cell phones become more popular and are beginning to be used for re-
search. Unlisted phone numbers are becoming more common. Mail surveys have become
largely ineffective, with response rates sometimes as low as the 1 to 3 percent range, which
can fail to meet the statistical criteria necessary for valid random sampling. Researchers
have been forced by these changes to find new ways to collect data from respondents. Tele-
phone and mail surveys are gradually being replaced by
online survey methods.
The Internet has opened up new opportunities for
collecting data (see the A Matter of Practice:Part 1fea-
ture). In Chapter 7you’ll read about the Billings, Mon-
tana, rebranding campaign in which the campaign was
launched with an online survey of more than 1,000 peo-
ple.We have printed here the screen download, “Take the
Survey,” from this effort.
In addition to survey research, the Internet can also be a
useful tool for monitoring online behavior. Jason Cormier, co-
founder of social-media agency Room 214, explains that mar-
keting communication research can be based on the data
provided by members of social networks such as Facebook.
The rebranding campaign for Billings began with a broad

Ways of Contact: Qualitative Methods
Various types of surveys are the most common quantitative research methods, but certain types
of surveys can also be used for probing and to gather more insightful responses.
In-Depth Interviews One qualitative method used to survey consumers is the in-depth inter-
view, which is conducted one-on-one using open-ended questions that require respondents to
generate their own answers. In a personal interview the researcher asks questions to the consumer
directly. The primary difference between an interview and a survey is the interviewer’s use of a
more flexible and unstructured questionnaire. This is the type of research method used by the
Lexus “super-affluent team” we discussed earlier. Interviewers use a discussion guide, which out-
lines the areas to be covered during the session.
The discussion guides tend to be longer than surveys with questions that are usually very
broad. Examples include “What do you like or dislike about this product?” and “What type of tel-
evision programs do you like to watch?” Interviewers probe by responding to the answer with
“Why do you say that?” or “Can you explain in more detail?” Interviews are considered qualita-
tive because they typically use smaller sample sizes than surveys, their results cannot be gener-
alized, and they are subjected to statistical tests.

Focus Groups Another qualitative method is a focus group, which is a group interview of 6 to 10
users and potential users of a product who are gathered around a table to have a discussion about
some topic, such as the brand, product category, or marketing communication. The objective is to
get participants talking in a conversational format so researchers can observe the dialogue and in-
teractions among the group. It’s a directed group interview. Amoderator supervises the group, pro-
viding direction through a set of carefully developed questions that stimulate conversation and elicit

the group members’thoughts and feelings in their own words. Other qualitative tools can also be
used with groups such as asking participants to create posters, diaries, or poems or complete exer-
cises in day mapping or memory associations (what comes to mind when you think of something,
such as a brand, situation, or location).
Focus groups can be used at any step in the planning process, but they are often used early
in information gathering to probe for patterns of thought and behavior that are then tested using
quantitative research tools, such as surveys. For example, the Cheetos team conducted focus
groups with adult heavy-users of Cheetos. Information from focus groups can uncover, as it did
in this case, answers to “how” and “why” questions. The Cheetos participants said they gave
themselves permission to lick their fingers and not act like adults. Focus groups are also useful in
testing creative ideas or exploring various alternatives in message strategy development.
Afriendship focus group11 takes place in a comfortable setting, usually a private home,
where the host has recruited the participants. This approach is designed to break down barriers
and save time in getting to more in-depth responses. For example, one study of sensitive and in-
sensitive visuals used in advertising directed to black women found that a self-constructed friend-
ship group was easier to assemble and yielded more honest and candid responses than a more
traditional focus group where respondents are recruited by a research company.12

Abroad-based approach to online focus groups is available through the new practice called
crowdsourcing, a term coined by Jeff Howe in Wiredmagazine in 2006.13It refers to aggregat-
ing the wisdom of Internet users in a type of digital brainstorming. In a search for “collective in-
telligence,” crowdsourcing collects opinions and ideas from a digital community.
Suggestions and Comments Informal feedback has always been available in stores through sug-
gestion boxes and customer satisfaction cards. Target took that idea online by publishing an ad in
theWall Street Journalasking customers to “Tell us what more we can do for you.” Some 627 re-
spondents e-mailed suggestions. Target then published the suggestions and the company’s re-
sponses to them in two-page ads. It was a novel way of eliciting comments, listening to them, and

The Internet has made it even easier to track comments about a brand. Many marketers, such as
IBM and Microsoft, monitor chats and blogs, and also do more general scanning for key words to find
out what people are saying about their brands and products. These findings can be incorporated back
into other methods, such as focus groups, to verify and explain the sentiments expressed online.14
Panels Anexpert panelgathers experts from various fields into a focus group setting. This re-
search tool can stimulate new ways of looking at a brand, product, or customer pattern. More
commonly, however, a marketing or consumer research panelis an ongoing group of carefully
selected people interested in a topic or product category. Astanding panel can be maintained over
time by a marketer as a proprietary source of information or by a research company whose clients
provide topics for the panel members’consideration. Panels can gather in person or be contacted
by phone, mail, or the Internet. An example of this type of research comes from cool hunters and
trend watchers who may use proprietary panels to track fashions and fads.

Observation Research Like anthropologists, observation researchers study the actual behavior
of consumers in settings where they live, work, shop, and play, acting as what Shay Sayre refers
to as “professional snoops.”15Directobservation researchis closer and more personal than most
other types of research. Researchers use video, audio, and disposable cameras to record con-
sumers’behavior at home (with consumer consent), in stores, or wherever people buy and use
their products. Amarketer may rely on observation in the aisles of grocery, drug, and discount
stores to watch people as they make product selections. Grocery shopping might seem like a mun-
dane, mechanical activity, but look around next time you’re in a store and watch how your fellow
shoppers make their product choices. An example of this type of experience comes from a New
York Timesarticle written by Kate Stein, a University of Florida student, who describes what it’s
like to participate in observational research.

The Consumer Behavior Odyssey was a classic observational research project that opened
the door for this type of research in marketing. The Odyssey put a team of researchers in a Win-
nebago on a trip from Los Angeles to Boston. Along the way, the researchers used a variety of ob-
servational techniques to watch and record people behaving as consumers.16

Major companies like Harley-Davidson and Coca-Cola hire marketing experts trained in so-
cial science research to observe and interpret customer behavior. These participant observers then
meet with the company’s managers, planners, and marketing staff to discuss their impressions.19
The case of Eight O’Clock coffee is an example of the use of a videotaped ethnographic study.
The brand’s agency, New York–based Kaplan Thaler, got 14 families in Pittsburgh and Chicago
to use video cameras to record their typical mornings in order to identify the various roles that
coffee played in their morning rituals.20
Direct observation and ethnographic research have the advantage of revealing what people
actually do, as distinguished from what people say they do. It can yield the correct answer when
faulty memory, a desire to impress the interviewer, or simple inattention to details would cause
an interview answer to be wrong. The biggest drawback to direct observation is that it shows what
is happening, but not why. Therefore, the results of direct observation often are combined with
personal interviews afterward to provide a more complete and more understandable picture of at-
titudes, motives, and behavior.
The McCann agency is dedicating a $2.5 million research effort to understanding the lives of
low-income Latinos from Mexico to Chile.21Anew division named “Barrio” studies the marketing
efforts of its clients, such as Nestlé and Danone. It has transformed conference rooms into “bode-
gas” (corner grocery shops) and sent employees to live with families amassing some 700 hours of
video recordings. The reason is that practical insights into low-income groups are hard to find,
yet these people are consumers, too, and marketers need to understand their needs as emerging
economies bring new lifestyles to the disadvantaged.
Diaries Sometimes consumers are asked to record their activities through the use of diaries.
Thesediariesare particularly valuable in media research because they tell media planners exactly
what programs and ads the consumers watched. If comment lines are provided, then the activi-
ties can also be accompanied by thoughts. Beeper diaries are used as a way to randomize the
recording of activities. Consumers participating in the study are instructed to grab the diary and
record what they are doing when the beeper goes off. Diaries are designed to catch the consumer
in a more realistic, normal life pattern than you can derive from surveys or interviews that rely on
consumers to remember their activities accurately. This can also lead to a helpful reconstruction
of a typical day in the life of a consumer.

182 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND
Other Qualitative Methods Marketing communication planners are always probing for rea-
sons, feelings, and motivations behind what people say and do. To arrive at useful consumer
insights, they use a variety of interesting and novel research methods. In particular, they use sto-
ries and pictures. Cognitive psychologists have learned that human beings think more in images
than in words. Most research continues to use words to ask questions and obtain answers, but re-
cent experiments with visual-based research opens up new avenues of expression that may be bet-
ter able to uncover people’s deep thoughts.
Researchers use pictures, as well as other tools to uncover mental processes that guide con-
sumer behavior. Professor Larry Soley refers to these methods as projective techniques,which
means they ask respondents to generate impressions rather than respond to more controlled quan-
titative surveys and rating systems. He describes projective techniques as psychoanalytic.23
Harvard Business School professor Gerald Zaltman believes that the conventional wisdom
about consumer research, such as using interviews and focus groups that rely on talking to peo-
ple and grilling them about their tastes and buying habits, is only good for getting back predictable
answers. If you ask people what they think about Coke, you’ll learn that it is a “high-energy,
thirst-quenching, fun-at-the-beach” kind of drink. But that may not be an adequate description of
how people really feel about the soft drink.24
Hereisacollectionofsomeofthemoreimaginativewaysqualitativeresearchersuseprojec-
tivetechniquesasgamestogatherinsightsaboutpeople’srelationshipswiththebrandstheybuy:
• Word associationis a projective technique that asks people to respond with thoughts or
other words that come to mind when they are given a stimulus word. The idea is to uncover
the networks of connections in their thought patterns. These are used to test brand personali-
ties, as well as other types of meanings that govern consumer behavior.
• Fill in the blanksis a form of attitude research in which people literally fill in the blanks in
a story or balloons in a cartoon. Perceptions can come to the surface in the words partici-
pants use to describe the action or situations depicted in the visuals.
• Sentence completiontests give respondents the beginning of a sentence and ask them to fin-
ish it. These are good at eliciting descriptions, causes, results, as well as the meanings in per-
sonal experiences.
• Purpose-driven gamesallow researchers to see how people solve problems and search for in-
formation.25Games can make the research experience more fun and involving for participants.
They also uncover problem-solving strategies that may mirror the participants’approach to in-
formation searching or the kinds of problems they deal with in certain product situations.
• Theater techniquesuse games in a theater setting where researchers have people experience
a variety of exercises to understand how they think about their brand. Some of these games
have people tell stories about products or simulations where they have to convince others to
use a brand.
• Sculpting and movement techniques,such as positioning the body as a statue, can be a
source of insight in brainstorming for creative ideas and new product ideas. Sculpting in-
volves physically putting product users in static positions that reflect how they think about
or use a brand. Physical movements, such as dance movements and martial arts, can be
added to increase the range of insight.
• Story elicitationasks consumers to explain the artifacts of their lives, such as the photos dis-
played in their homes and the objects they treasure. These stories can provide insights into
how and why people use or do things.
• Artifact creationis a technique that uses such ideas as life collages, day mapping (tracking
someone’s activities across a day), and the construction of instruction books as ways to elicit
stories that discuss brands and their role in daily life. These projects are also useful later in
explaining to others—clients, the creative team, or other agencies—the triggers behind con-
sumer insights.26

CHAPTER 6 • STRATEGIC RESEARCH 183
• Photo sorts,which is yet another visual technique, asks con-
sumers to sort through a deck of photos and pick out visuals
that represent something to them, such as typical users of
the product or situations where it might be used. In identify-
ing typical users, they may be asked to sort the photos into
specific piles, such as happy, sad, angry, excited, or innova-
tive people.
• Metaphorsis a tool used by researchers to enrich the language
consumers use to talk about brands. (Remember your gram-
mar: Ametaphorcompares one thing to another without using
the actual words likeoras.) The Evian ad, for example, uses a
strong metaphor to define its product. The insight into how
people perceive brands through such connections comes from
exploring the link between the two concepts. Metaphor games
are used in creativity to elicit new and novel ideas, but they can
also be used to analyze cognitive patterns in people’s thinking.
These methods can be combined. Harvard professor Zalt-
man is the creator of ZMET(pronounced ZEE-MET), the Zalt-
man Metaphor Elicitation Technique, which uses metaphors and
visual images to uncover patterns in people’s thinking. For a typ-
ical session, the respondents bring images that they think relate
to the product category or brand being studied. Then they make
up stories that describe their feelings about the product or
brand.27The Cheetos research team used the ZMETand uncov-
ered the unexpected finding about stress and how Cheetos was an escape from those pressures.

Choosing a Research Method
Determining the appropriate research method to use is an important planning decision. It might
help to understand two basic research criteria, validity and reliability, that are derived from what
researchers call the “scientific method.” Validitymeans that the research actually measures what
it says it measures. Any differences that are uncovered by the research, such as different attitudes
or purchasing patterns, really reflect differences among individuals, groups, or situations.
Reliabilitymeans that you can run the same test again and get the same answer.
Quantitative researchers, particularly those doing experiments and surveys, are concerned
about being faithful to the principles of science. Selecting a sample that truly represents the
population, for example, increases the reliability of the research. Poorly worded questions and
talking to the wrong people can hurt the validity of surveys, as well as focus groups. The prob-
lem with experiments is twofold: (1) experiments are limited by a small number of people in the
experimental group, and (2) they are conducted under artificial conditions.
The information you get from surveys of a broad cross section of a population is limited to
your ability to develop good clear questions that everyone can understand and answer. This tight
control makes it harder to ask questions around the edges of a topic or elicit unexpected or un-
usual responses. On the other hand, focus groups and in-depth interviews that permit probing are
limited by small numbers and possible problems with the representativeness of the sample.
Generally, quantitative methods are more useful for gathering data (how many do this or
believe that?), and qualitative methods are better at uncovering reasons and motives (why do
they do or believe?). For these reasons, most researchers use a variety of research methods—
quantitative and qualitative and occasionally experimental designs. Which method should you
choose when you conduct research? The answer depends on what questions you need to answer.

RESEARCH TRENDS AND CHALLENGES
Marketing communication researchers face a number of challenges: globalizationand new me-
dia technology are reshaping the industry. Practices are also changing as the industry searches for
ways to more naturally embed research as feedback, as well as gain more insightful analysis and
move into IMC planning. Let’s examine each challenge briefly.
Global Issues
The key issues that global researchers face include how to manage and communicate global

feine.Intestmarketstheagencydiscoveredthatperceptionsaboutcaffeinevarypositivelyand
negativelyindifferentcultures.
IMC Research Challenges
The deluge of data is only complicated by IMC planning, which requires research into many
stakeholder groups and contact points. Instead of campaign planning where messages are
tweaked slightly to fit different media, strategic consistencyin IMC planning suggests that dif-
ferent audiences, as well as media, need different messages. Susan Mendelsohn calls this a more
radical trend in planning research and points to “companies that are experimenting with multi-
message strategies that fit each vehicle uniquely and yet might be radically different from each
other.” She cautions that the company needs to be clear about the goals for its brand, recognizing
that there might be multiple goals—a set of integrated goals—rather than one big underlying goal
and that suggests multiple measurements of effectiveness, as well.
Planning for Feedback
Learning how to better listen to consumers has become an important factor in effective market-
ing communication. Earlier we mentioned the use of customer contact to elicit feedback; there
are also ways to structure feedback into message strategies. In embedded feedback research,the
research method is built into the response, including the contact point, purchase activity, and use
situations. Campaigns that encourage interested prospects to contact a company, for example, are
setting up response monitoring as part of the message strategy. Call centers, both inbound (cus-
tomer calls to complain or get assistance) and outbound (telemarketing), can also be used as re-
search centers to gain real-time feedback about the brand and its marketing and advertising
strategies. In other words, whenever a call is made, for whatever purpose, that contact provides
an opportunity to ask a brand-related question. Marketers also monitor blogs, chat rooms, and so-
cial media (Facebook, MySpace, Twitter) for clues about what people are saying about a brand.
An example of a structured feedback program comes from Nordstrom’s Personal Touch Pro-
gram, which uses a team of personal shopperswho are fashion consultants on one level but on
another level are trained to gather information from their clients to feed back into the company’s
business planning and marketing.
Looking Ahead
Research, analysis, and new techniques such as crowdsourcing, lead to marketing communica-
tion plans and strategic decisions, which will be the topic of the next chapter. The research find-
ings also lead to message strategies, which we introduce in Part 3, and media strategies, which
will follow in Part 4.
CHAPTER 6 • STRATEGIC RESEARCH 185
IT’S A WRAP
Comfort Food for Thought
Cheetos’ research shifted the focus of its strategy from kids to “rejuvenile” adults as a target audience. Key
insights from research efforts shaped the creative direction to create edgy humor that spoke to those cur-
rent and would-be Cheetos lovers. The message became “It’s all about fun”—and that appealed to a certain
segment of the adult audience, who just happened to be fans of Cheetos.
Consultant Howard Papush, aka Dr. Play, said, “When we’re stressed, we revert back to the things that
comforted us as kids. We want to play our way through stress.” It seems to be a universal truth, at least for
some of us, that comfort food, aka Cheetos, can occasionally be a good way to relieve stress. And orange fin-
gers are fun.
Interestingly, little in the campaign speaks about the product. Yet, the campaign seems to succeed,
maybe because the audience it seeks rejects a direct push about the product. Besides, who doesn’t know
what Cheetos are? Did the campaign work to accomplish the objective of repositioning the brand for a new
target market? Several indicators suggest the success of the Cheetos campaign.
First, and most importantly, Cheetos’ sales rose significantly, almost doubling the targeted rate. In a track-
ing study about the best-regarded snack brands, Cheetos improved from 41st position to 34th, and this im-
provement was mainly from households without children.
The repositioning strategy created energy for the brand by connecting the message that this snack could
help consumers lighten up with its audience in a variety of traditional and digital media. Disregarding your
mother’s admonition not to play with your food, this campaign tells you it’s okay in ways that speak effectively
to the target audience. The new Cheetos campaign created more than mischievous fun. It made award-winning
advertising communication. In 2009 the Advertising Research Foundation awarded this campaign its best of
show, the Grand Ogilvy Winner.

How to Sell Diet Drinks to People
Who Don’t Like the Idea of Diet Drinks
How many guys do you know who admit they are on a diet? Probably not many.
Diets are kind of a girl thing. So you can imagine the job Coca-Cola had when
it wanted to convince young men ages 18 to 34 to try its no-calorie Coke
Zero. The very dudes Coca-Cola wanted to appeal to said that diet sodas tasted
bad and were far too feminine for them.
Although Coke Zero had been around for three years and was gaining ac-
ceptance, Coca-Cola wanted to grow its share of market by adding the 18- to
34-year-old male demographic. This wouldn’t be an easy sell. Enter Crispin Porter (cid:2)
Bogusky (CP(cid:2)B), an agency that has made its award-winning reputation on edgy
work that reaches the target market.
CP(cid:2)B knew from Coca-Cola’s research that these guys liked the taste of reg-
ular sugary sodas, but as they aged they began to drink more lower calorie options
like energy drinks, water, or sports drinks and less pop. To accomplish the client’s
three main objectives—increase brand awareness, motivate the target audience to
try Coke Zero, and convince men 18–34 that Coke Zero tastes like Coke—CP(cid:2)B
relied on consumer research, which indicated that those who tried Coke Zero really
thought it tasted like Coke.
Knowing that young men had a negative perception of anything “diet,” CP(cid:2)B
proposed to the client that the advertising should focus on the taste similarity of
the two products in a funny campaign that would appeal to the skeptical audience.
CP(cid:2)B thought Coke Zero would be a great alternative if, and it’s a big if, these
young 18–34 men could be convinced it tasted as good as regular Coca-Cola.
CP(cid:2)B’s strategy then was to convince guys that calorie-free (note they don’t say
“diet”) Coke Zero was as good as “the real thing.” But how?
The communication strategy focused on appealing to the male target through
wide-reaching media such as out-of-home media and cinema (a whopping 87 per-
cent of all U.S. theaters) to build awareness, and print, TV, digital, and radio to en-
courage product trial. Where Coke had big brand presence, such as with NASCAR,
the NCAA, and Fantasy Football, there too went Coke Zero. And why there?
189
190 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND
The creative strategy was based on the self-deprecating humor you recognize
from The Daily ShowandThe Office. The gist of the big idea was that the legal de-
partment from Coca-Cola wanted to sue Coke Zero for taste infringement. The
company made fun of itself proposing imaginary lawsuits and provided a non-
traditional campaign for Coke Zero. In one commercial, an unsuspecting real attor-
ney warns actors portraying Coke Classic executives not to sue Coke Zero, lest the
suit be dismissed and they be utterly humiliated.
So where you might expect to see a Coke message, you might also see the
lawyers ranting about Coke Zero stealing its taste. Here’s a fun example. At the
NCAA Final Four event in San Antonio, passersby could see a “Stop Coke Zero”
rally and sample the taste similarity, providing an opportunity to prove to the
targeted males that Coke Zero really did taste like Coke. CP(cid:2)B even created an
advergame, called Rooftop Racer. The object of this NASCAR game was to invite
players to step into a virtual car and race with other fellow drivers to the finish line
while balancing a Coke Zero bottle on top of their car. Visitors to the CokeZero.com
site could “Sue a Friend.”
This campaign signifies a shift in thinking about media strategy for Coca-Cola
products, according to Katie Bayne, senior vice president for Coco-Cola brands in
North America at Coca-Cola in Atlanta. “It’s not just about a television spot,” she
said. That is especially true for Coke Zero as we look at where we need to be to
connect with the target audience. So what lesson do we learn from Coke Zero?
Sometimes you’ve got to take calculated risks, and sometimes they pay off, espe-
cially when you use well-conceived message and media strategies to connect with
a carefully targeted audience.
To see more of this campaign, check out the Coke Zero website, www.cokezero
.com. To see how well this oddball campaign connected with young males, turn to

Marketing and advertising strategies are chosen from an array of possible alternatives. In most
cases, there is no one completely right way to do anything in advertising, but if you understand
how advertising works, you may be able to identify the best strategy to accomplish the objectives.
This chapter explains the concept of strategic planning as it is used in business, marketing, and
advertising and integrated marketing communication (IMC) plans. It covers key planning deci-
sions, such as identifying critical problems and opportunities, targeting the right audience, posi-
tioning or repositioning the brand against the competition, and making implementation decisions.
It also introduces the concept of account planning and explains its critical role in determining the
consumer insights that lead to message and media strategies.
WHAT IS STRATEGIC PLANNING?
For marketing communication, strategic planning is the process of identifying a problem that
can be solved with marketing communication, then determining objectives(what you want to ac-
complish), deciding on strategies (how to accomplish the objectives), and implementing the
tactics (actions that make the plan come to life). This process occurs within a specified time
frame. Objectives are usually long-term propositions, strategies are more medium term in focus,
and tactics are more short term.
CHAPTER 7 • STRATEGIC PLANNING 191
Even those experienced in advertising sometimes have a hard time telling the difference be-
tween an objective and a strategy. Remember, an objectiveis a goal to be accomplished; in ad-
vertising, objectives are determined by the effects you want to achieve. Astrategyis the means,
the design or plan, by which the objective is accomplished—the advertising message and media
strategies, for example. In advertising, tactics are the way the ads and other marketing commu-
nication efforts are executed—how they are designed and what they say.
In the Coke Zero case, the objective was to position Coke Zero as tasting like regular Coke.
The strategy was to use taste tests so the young male target could experience how similar the
tastes were. The tactic was to use the idea of “taste infringement” complete with lawyers, actors,
and imaginary lawsuits.
We talk a lot about creativity in this book and we’d like to emphasize that strategic thinking
is just as creative as coming up with a Big Idea for a marketing communication campaign. Both
processes involve searching for ideas to solve problems, whether they are found in marketing sit-
uations or communication challenges. Pat Fallon and Fred Senn, cofounders of the legendary
agency Fallon Worldwide, explain that principle in their book, Juicing the Orange:How to Turn
Creativity into a Powerful Business Advantage.They have identified seven principles that link
creative thinking and strategic planning to business results1:
1. Always Start from ScratchSimplify the problem. You know too much. There’s a good
chance that you know so much that you can’t see how the problem could be solved in a
fresh way.
2. Demand a Ruthlessly Simple Definition of the Business ProblemSmart people tend to
make things too complicated. Be a relentless reductionist. Einstein said, “Make things as
simple as possible, but no simpler.”
3. Discover a Proprietary EmotionThe key component of any communication program is a
powerful consumer insight that leads to a ruthlessly smart strategy executed brilliantly
across all platforms. It all starts with the insight, which is the central truth of what you are Pat Fallon (top) and
Fred Senn were
going to say and how you are going to operate. Once you find an emotional truth, you can

a changing environment—who prosper both in nature and in a capitalist economy.
6. Collaborate or PerishThis is more than “getting along”; it is about recognizing that the rules
of engagement have changed. We live in an era in which victory goes to the best collabora-
tors. This means teams from different disciplines and different corporate cultures will be
working together. Teams that are aligned and motivated can make history.
7. Listen Hard to Your Customers (Then Listen Some More)Listening is often step Number
One on the road to understanding. Listening often yields that precious insight that gives
you a competitive advantage; something your competitors have overlooked.
The Business Plan
Strategic planning is a three-tiered process that starts with the business plan and then moves to
functional areas of the company such as marketing where a marketing plan is developed that out-
lines objectives, strategies, and tactics for all areas of the marketing mix. As illustrated in Figure 7.1,
both the business plan and the marketing plan provide direction to specific plans for specialist
areas, such as advertising and other areas of marketing communication.

Note that the business planning process starts with a business mission statement,a concise
expression of the broad goals and policies of the business unit. The mission statement is unique,
focused, and differentiating. Tom’s of Maine states its mission clearly on its website:
“Through the years, we have been guided by one simple notion—do what is right, for our
customers, employees, communities, and environment. We call this Natural Care—a phi-
losophy that guides what we make and all that we do.”
The Marketing Plan
Amarketing planis developed for a brand or product line and evaluated annually, although sec-
tions dealing with long-term goals might operate for a number of years. To a large extent, the mar-
keting plan mirrors the company’s business plan and contains many of the same components,
although they are focused on a specific brand rather than the larger organization or corporation.
Figure 7.3illustrates the steps involved in creating a marketing plan.

CHAPTER 7 • STRATEGIC PLANNING 193
A market situation analysis is based on
extensive market research that assesses the
external and internal environments that affect
marketing operations—the company’s history,
products, and brands, as well as the competitive
environment, consumer trends, and other mar-
ketplace trends that have some impact on the
product category. A set of “what’s going on”
questions helps structure this market analysis.
Answers to these questions help define the key
marketing problem and, ultimately, the SWOTs,
which stands for strengths, weaknesses, oppor-
tunities and threats:
• What is happening with the brand and the
category?
• How is it happening?
• Where is it happening?
• When is it happening?
• To whom is it happening?
We could answer those questions for Coke
Zero by summarizing the market situation and

ing plan is the marketing mix strategy,which includes decisions about the target market, brand
position, product design and performance, pricing, and distribution, as well as marketing com-
munication. Product design and formulation decisions are sometimes responses to consumer
trends, such as the increase in the number of packaged foods making high-fiber claims (think
Fiber One with its expanded line of cereals and snack bars). Other challenges to marketing plan-
ners came from the competition. When McDonald’s began advertising its Angus burger in 2009,
the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. chains responded with taste challenges, mail-in refund promotions, and
parodies of Big Mac advertisements.2

Steps in the Development of a Marketing Plan
Amarketing plan begins with an analysis of the marketing situation in terms of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Setting ob-
jectives is the next step. Target markets are selected and marketing strategies are developed, as well as action plans and specific executions of
ideas and programs. The plan is evaluated and that information feeds back into the next generation of planning.
194 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND
This marketing analysis—and the marketing mix strategy derived from it—link the overall
strategic business plan with specific marketing programs, including advertising and other IMC areas.
Whether to use a frequency club, an advertising campaign, or a sales promotion strategy to increase
brand loyalty, for example, are marketing communication decisions that support marketing strategies.
Anew contributor to this process is crowdsourcing, which we mentioned in the previous
chapter. This practice mobilizes a digital crowd to provide collective intelligence. For example,
consider how Wikipedia operates with experts contributing and reviewing entries. In a marketing
environment, crowdsourcing can be used to channel the latent wisdom of online crowds includ-
ing experts as well as average citizens. John Fluevog Open Source Footwear is a company that
invites anyone to contribute ideas for shoes. Decisions about the best ideas are made through peer
voting, feasibility, and admittedly what the owner John Fluevog likes. The design ideas become
public domain but the company adds the winners to its line of shoes. Check out this interesting
company at www.fluevog.com/files_2/os-1.html. Procter & Gamble uses InnoCentive.com, a dig-
ital think tank for innovation, to engage some 140,000 scientists and engineers worldwide to help
with its research and development.3

An example of how all of these elements come together in a plan comes from a brand iden-
tity campaign for the city of Billings, Montana. The Inside Storyfeature gives you a look inside
the planning of a branding campaign for a place. Pay particular attention to the “Brand Standards”
online guidebook at the website www.brandbillings.com. This online guidebook explains how the
campaign is designed to create a unified voice for the community with a consistent image and
message, one that reinforces Billings’unique geography, resources, and heritage.
Let’s now look at how an advertising or marketing communication plan is developed. The
following discussion outlines the basic steps in planning a campaign, as well as the critical strate-
gic decisions planners must make.
WHAT’S IN A CAMPAIGN PLAN?
In addition to or instead of an annual marketing plan, a firm may develop a campaign planthat
is more tightly focused on solving a particular marketing communication problem in a specified
time. Such a plan typically includes a variety of marcom messages carried in different media and
sometimes targeted to different audiences. The following outline traces the steps, and the deci-
sions they represent, in a typical campaign plan.

and presentations to clubs and service groups followed by
countless hours of strategic envisioning sessions. The re-
search and analysis determined that Billings is a very spe-
cial place that merges its location with an attitude—a
position that combines “open space” and “western pace.”
The important brand characteristics begin with its
location—shaped by the Yellowstone River and sheltered
by the Rims geographic formation. The community is
progressive and a regional center for finance, health
care, transportation, arts and culture, and diverse educa-
tional opportunities. Its hard-working citizens have a
unique Montana perspective that combines warmth with
an appreciation of scenery and history. But what also de-
fines them most is a lifestyle that loves the adventure of
an untamed wilderness right outside the door.
Those characteristics translated into a statement of
Billings brand essence as “Montana’s city connects you
to the authentic historical west.” The “trailhead” idea
springs from the recognition that Billings is a starting
point for business growth and development, as well as a
gateway for opportunities to explore the wonders of
Montana. The starting point idea was supported in the
“trail” graphic with its “X marks the spot” symbol. The
“Where Ya Headin’?” tagline expresses the idea that
Billings is the gateway for adventure.
The campaign’s objective was to create a position
that expresses this brand essence and to create a con-
sistent and cohesive brand message that unifies the
city’s efforts to encourage business and workforce de-
velopment, individual and family relocation, tourism,
and community pride. The Travel Planner is the primary piece sent to visitors

tives, (3) targeting the audience, (4) creating or reinforcing a position, (5) identifying the key
strategic approach that will deliver the objectives, and (6) using management controls to deter-
mine efficiency in budgeting and effectiveness through evaluation. Let’s look at these strategic
planning decisions in more detail.
Situation Analysis
The first step in developing an advertising plan, just as in a marketing plan, is not planning but
backgrounding—researching and reviewing the current state of the business that is relevant to the
brand and gathering all pertinent information. After the research is compiled, planners try to make
sense of the findings, a process sometimes referred to as a situation analysis.The goal is to iden-
tify a problem that can be solved with communication. As Fallon and Senn explained in their
“Juicing the Orange” list, you have to start by simplifying the problem. The information collec-
tion will probably be huge, but the problem statement should simplify the task.
Principle SWOT Analysis The primary tool used to make sense of the information gathered and identify

and opportunities.
• Thestrengthsof a business are its positive traits, conditions, and good situations. For in-
stance, being in a growth industry is a strength. Planners ask how they can leverage this
strength in the brand’s advertising.
• Theweaknessesof a business are traits, conditions, and situations that are perceived as neg-
atives. Losing market share is a weakness. If this is an important weakness, then planners
ask how they can address it with advertising.
• Anopportunityis an area in which the company could develop an advantage over its com-
petition. Often, one company’s weakness is another company’s opportunity. Planners strive
to identify these opportunities and leverage them in the brand’s advertising.
• Athreatis a trend or development in the environment that will erode business unless the
company takes action. Competition and economic downturns are common threats. Advertis-

ing planners ask themselves how they can address a threat if it is a critical factor affecting
the success of the brand.
In the Coke Zero case, the strength of the brand lies with the Coca-Cola tradition as “the real
thing.” The opportunity existed to transfer that Coke magic to a calorie-free version of the flag-
ship brand. The weakness is the association of diet drinks with women. The threat lies with the
idea that “diet drinks” have an unpleasant taste.
Key Problem(s) The key word in the title of this section is analysis,or making sense of all the
data collected and figuring out what the information means for the future success of the brand.
Advertising planners must analyze the market situation for communication problems that affect
the successful marketing of a product, as well as opportunities the advertising can create or ex-
ploit. Analyzing the SWOTs and identifying any problems that can be solved with an advertising
message are at the heart of strategic thinking. An example of locating a timing opportunity is il-
lustrated by the Special K “2-Week Challenge” that capitalized on consumers’ goals to lose
weight after the holidays.

SHOWCASE
This two-week Kellogg’s Special K challenge promises customers they will lose up to six pounds
in two weeks by replacing two meals a day with Special K and eating a sensible third meal. Reaching
consumers at the moment they are in need of a weight-loss solution and delivering a simple diet in the
context of their environment—in this case posters in department store dressing rooms, health clubs,
doctor’s offices, hair or nail salons, and bridal salons—was very effective. Business results included an
overall increase in the poster markets of 20 percent over nonposter markets.
These two posters for Special K were contributed by Amy Hume, communications
consultant in the Integrated University Communications office at the University of
Colorado–Denver. Hume is a graduate of the University of Colorado–Boulder
and was an associate media director at Starcom Worldwide where she
handled this mini-campaign for Special K. She and her work were nominated
for inclusion in this book by professor Tom Duncan.

Objectives
After planners have examined the external and internal environments and defined the critical areas
that need to be addressed, they can develop specific objectives to be accomplished during a spec-
ified time period. Objectivesare formal statements of the goals of the advertising or other mar-
keting communication. They outline what the message is designed to achieve in the long term and
how it will be measured.
Main Effects and Objectives Remember from Chapter 4the six categories in The Facets Model
of Effects: perception, emotion, cognition, persuasion, association, and behavior. These main ef-
fects also can be used to identify the most common consumer-focused objectives. For example,
here are some sample objectives for each category, as well as sample ads and campaigns that we
have discussed in this or previous chapters:
• Perception ObjectivesGrab attention; create awareness; stimulate interest; stimulate recog-
nition of the brand or the message; create brand reminder.
Example:“1984” ad for Macintosh launch
• Emotional/Affective ObjectivesTouch emotions; cue the psychological appeal; create brand
or message liking; stimulate brand loyalty; stimulate desire.
Example:Burger King “Whopper Freakout” campaign
• Cognition ObjectivesEstablish brand identity; establish or cue the brand position; deliver
information; aid in understanding features, benefits, and brand differences; explain how to
do or use something; stimulate recall of the brand message; stimulate brand loyalty; brand
reminder.
Example:“Wii would like to play” launch

• Persuasion ObjectivesStimulate opinion or attitude formation; change or reinforce opinion or
attitude; present argument and reasons; counterargue; create conviction or belief; stimulate
brand preference or intent to try or buy; reward positive or desired response; stimulate brand
loyalty; create buzz or word of mouth; energize opinion leaders; create advocacy and referrals.

Example:Special K “2-Week Challenge,” campaigns encouraging participation in the
2010 census
Given the huge amounts of money spent on advertising, it is important for advertisers to know
what to expect from a campaign or ad. Although a rule of thumb for advertising is that it should be
single minded, we also know from Chapter 4that multiple effects are often needed to create the
desired impact. Some ads may use an emotional strategy while others are informational, but some-
times the message needs to speak to both the head and the heart. That was particularly true for the
Coke Zero campaign: customers needed to understand that the taste of Coke Zero was similar to
regular Coke but it had to do it with a style and attitude that twenty-something males would like.
Although some objectives are tightly focused on one particular effect, others, such as brand
loyalty, call for a more complex set of effects. To create brand loyalty, for example, an advertising
campaign must have both cognitive (rational) and affective (emotional) effects, and it must move
people to repeat buying. That’s one reason brand loyalty is considered a type of long-term impact
developed over time from many experiences that a consumer has with a brand and brand messages.
Note also that communication objectives may be important, even if they aren’t focused di-
rectly on a sale. For example, Expedia.com, a travel consulting company, views its advertising as
a way to draw attention to itself, create name recognition, and create understanding of the prod-
ucts and services it sells.
Measurable Objectives We cannot overstate the importance of writing focused and measurable
advertising objectives. Every campaign, and the ads in it, must be guided by specific, clear, and
measurable objectives. We say measurable objectivesbecause that’s how the effectiveness of ad-
vertising is determined. It is also critical that an objective be benchmarked, which means the
planner uses a comparable effort, such as a similar product or prior brand campaign, to predict a
logical goal. Ameasurable objective includes five requirements:
1. Aspecific effectthat can be measured
2. Atime frame
3. Abaseline(where we are or where we begin)
4. The goal(a realistic estimate of the change the campaign can create; benchmarking is used
to justify the projected goal)
5. Percentagechange(subtractthebaselinefromthegoal;dividethedifferencebythe
baseline).
Ahypothetical objective, then, would read like this: The goal of this campaign is to move the
target’s awareness of Coke Zero’s taste similarity with regular Coke from 18 to 23 percent within
12 months,an increase of 28 percent.
Targeting
We discussed targeting and segmenting in Chapter 5, which are strategic decisions made possi-
ble because of a deep knowledge of consumers. In particular, this research-based knowledge iden-
tifies what makes specific groups of consumers different from people in other groups. These
characteristics also identify how consumers are similar to others in ways that characterize a spe-
cific type of viewpoint or lifestyle, such as the student partying lifestyle on many campuses, a
problem addressed by the Navigators’posters.
200 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND
SHOWCASE
These anti–drunk driving posters were used in the Nightlife Navigators campaign at the University of Florida. They were created by
the Adwerks student-run advertising agency.
As we discussed in Chapter 5, segmenting and targeting are important because marketing
communication strategy is based on accurately targeting an audience that will be responsive to a
particular type of message, one that will deliver the objectives.
There is more to targeting than just identifying and profiling a possible audience. How does
the target audience relate to the brand? General Mills, for example, during the recent recession
was able to maintain significant marketing increases by concentrating on its big-name brands, but
also on its multicultural consumers, which the marketer saw as a “high ROI area.”5Advertising
planners also want to know what’s going on in people’s heads and hearts—what motivates them
to attend to a message and respond to it. Getting deeper insight into consumers is the responsi-
bility of the account planning function. We’ll return to that role later in this chapter.
We want to emphasize that understanding a target audience demands an appreciation of
diversity—and the empathy that results from such an appreciation. Professor Peggy Kreshel de-
fines diversityas “the acknowledgment and inclusion of a wide variety of people with differ-
ing characteristics, attributes, beliefs, values, and experiences.” In advertising, diversity tends
to be discussed primarily in terms of representations of gender,race,andethnicity in advertis-
ing content,although as she points out in the A Principled Practicefeature, diversity goes be-
yond the images used in ads. This is the heart of the issue raised in the excerpt in Chapter 5
fromMadison Avenue and the Color Lineby historian Jason Chambers, which Kreshel refer-
ences in her essay.
In recognition of the importance of this diversity issue, the American Advertising Feder-
ation (AAF) sponsors multicultural programs such as the Most Promising Minority Students
and the AAF Mosaic Awards. The leader of those programs, Constance Cannon Frazier, is on
this book’s Advisory Board and the work of some of the Most Promising Minority Students

Positioning
Principle Another reason we revisit targeting here is because understanding the target is the first step in un-

Hallmark). Secondly, that feature must be important to the consumer.
Aclassic example of positioning is the campaign for Avis, which used the line “We Try
Harder” to describe how it competes against category leader Hertz. The line was not only a good
positioning statement, it also was named as one of the Top 10 Slogans of the 20th Century. The
campaign was described by the fathers of positioning, Jack Trout and Al Ries, in their ground-
breaking book Positioning:The Battle for Your Mind.8
Aposition is based on some notion of comparison. Is the brand more expensive or less; is it
a status product or a symbol of frugality; is it sporty, functional, safe or extremely risky? Wal-
mart’s position, for example, is encompassed in its slogan, “Always Low Prices.” Positioning,
then, is about locking the brand in consumers’minds based on some quality relevant to them
where the brand stands out. Compare the positioning strategies of the various arms of the U.S.
military as they represent themselves in their ads.

Principle Product Features and Attributes An initial step in crafting a position is to identify the features
Positioning identifies the of the brand, as well as those of the competition, to determine where the brand has an advantage
features that make a over its competitors. Amarketer carefully evaluates the product’s tangible features (such as size,
brand different from its color, design, price, and ease of use) and other intangible attributes (such as quality, status, value,
competitors and relevant fashion, and safety) to identify the dimensions of the product that are relevant to its customers
to consumers
and that make it different from its competitors.
An interesting twist on features developed when the electric hybrid cars, such as GM’s Volt,
were introduced to the market. The standard MPG estimate of fuel efficiency was turned upside
down with projections of 230 MPG for Volt and 367 MPG for the Nissan Leaf. Of course, these
cars use very little gas as long as they are running on their batteries—gas is only used when the
charge runs out. If you only use the car to run around town, theoretically you could get unlimited
gas mileage.9So what does this changing standard do to traditional car-buying marketing and de-
cision making?
Differentiation and Competitive Advantage Most markets involve a high level of competition.
How does a company compete in a crowded market? It uses product differentiation,a strategy
designed to focus attention on product differences that are important to consumers and that dis-
tinguish the company’s product from that of its competitors. We refer to products that really are
the same (examples include milk, unleaded gas, and over-the-counter drugs) as undifferentiated
orparity products.For these products marketers often promote intangible, or psychological, dif-
ferences, particularly through branding.
The creation of a unique brand image for a product (think Swatch) is the most obvious way
to differentiate one product from another. Internet-based Mozilla and Craigslist are small com-
panies but big brands that are strong because they have the support of dedicated users. This strong
customer–brand relationship reflects a leadership position—a brand that has defined or created

its category. But it’s not just hot Internet companies that have achieved this type of leadership—
McIlhenny’s Tabasco Sauce, which was launched in 1868, created and still owns the hot sauce
category.
A technique called feature analysis helps structure an assessment of features relative to
competitors’products to identify where a brand has an advantage. To conduct a feature analysis,
first, make a chart of the product and competitors’products, listing relevant features, as the fol-
lowing table illustrates. Then evaluate how well the product and the competitors’products per-
form on those features. What are the brand’s strong points or weak points? Next, evaluate how
important each feature is to the target audience using opinion research. In other words, how much
do consumers care about various features (which ones are most important to them) and how do
the various brands compare on these features?
How to Do a Feature Analysis
Product Performance
Feature Importance to Prospect Yours X Y Z
Price 1 (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2)
Quality 4 (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2)

Availability 3 (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:3)
Durability 5 (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)
Using the two factors of importance and performance, competitive advantageis found where
(1) the product has a strong feature (2) in an area that is important to the target and (3) where the com-
petition is weaker. The product in the preceding table would compete well on both price and style against
X, on price against competitor Y, and on style against competitor Z. Competitor X seems the most vul-
nerable on two features, price and style, that consumers rate as the most important decision points.

Locating the Brand Position Let’s return now to the concept of a position to see how it is cre-
ated. In addition to specific product attributes, a number of factors can be used to locate a posi-
tion for a brand including the following:
• Superiority PositionJack Trout suggests that positioning is always easy if something is
faster, fancier, safer, or newer.
• PreemptivePositionBeingfirstinthecategoryoftencreatescategoryleadershipand
dominance.
• Value PositionWalmart’s “Always Low Prices” is the epitome of offering good value for the
money. Hyundai rode that position through the economic downturn and picked up market
share faster than its competitors, passing both Honda and Ford to become the 4th largest au-
tomaker in the world.10
• Psychological PositionOften brands are designed around nonproduct differences. For psy-
chological positions, consider these examples: Volvo owns the safety position, Coke owns a
position of authenticity for colas (“It’s the real thing”), and Hallmark a quality position
(“When you care enough to send the very best”).
• Benefit PositionHow does the product help the consumer?
• Usage PositionHow, where, and when is the product used and who is using it?
• Competitor’s StrategyHow can the product go head to head with or move completely away
from the competition?
• Category FactorsIs the competition coming from outside the category and, if so, how does
the brand compare to these other categories and how does that change the analysis of
Principle strengths and weaknesses?
Strong brands are known
As we’ve mentioned the differences have to be distinctive to the brand, as well as important
for one thing—the test is
to the consumer. The point is that strong brands become well known for one thing. When you

CHAPTER 7 • STRATEGIC PLANNING 205
James Stengel, former global marketing chief at Procter &
Upscale/Luxury
Gamble, has developed a new positioning approach that he calls
“purpose-based marketing.” He points to P&G’s Pampers brand,
which moved from just keeping babies’bottoms dry to a higher
purpose—helping moms nurture healthy, happy babies. The com-
pany created new programs offering parenting advice and con-
ducted research on infant-related problems such as sleeping that
led to product redesigns.11
Many ad campaigns are designed to establish the brand’s po-
sition by giving the right set of cues about these decision factors to
help place the brand in the consumer’s mind. If a position is a point
in a consumer’s mind, planners can map that—in fact, the way
planners compare positions is by using a technique called a
perceptual mapthat plots all of the competitors on a matrix based
on the two most important consumer decision factors. Figure 7.4
illustrates how positions can be mapped for automobiles.
Repositioning Positions are difficult to establish and take years of

the target market.
Repositioning, in the view of the Ries’s, can only work if the new position is related to the
brand’s core concept. They are wary of Kodak’s move and wonder if the link between the Kodak
brand and film is too strong to stretch to digital products. Instead, they recommend using a new
brand name for the line of digital products.12It will be interesting to see how this repositioning
strategy turns out and if Kodak’s position can be redefined as galleries of pictures rather than film
and photo albums.

Advertising may express the position, but personal experiences anchor it in the target audi-
ence’s mind. The role of the brand communication strategy, then, is to relate the product’s posi-
tion to the target market’s life experience and associations. The principle in repositioning is to
move ahead while at the same time retaining the brand essence. Aclassic example of an effective
repositioning campaign that retains the brand essence as it carves out a new location in con-
sumers’minds is 7-Up, which is described in the A Matter of Principlefeature.
But sometimes the repositioning strategy may not work. How will it work, for example,
when Rolls-Royce unveils an economy car, or at least one that costs a third less than its $380,000
flagship Phantom. Can Rolls use a cheaper car to pump up volume sales or will that strategy di-
lute the brand’s exclusive image?
Brand Communication Strategy
After the objectives, targeting, and positioning have been stated, the next step is to decide the key
strategic approach that will deliver the objectives. We’ll discuss this in more detail later in this
chapter as we explain the “communication brief” created by the account planner to give direction
to the creative team. It will also be discussed in more depth in the Chapter 8on message strategy.
For now, however, consider that the six main effects outlined in the Facets Model all lead to
different communication objectives and, therefore, to different strategies. Let’s just consider the two

most basic approaches, which we sometimes refer to as appealing to the head or the heart. Hard-
sell approachesuse reasons to persuadeconsumers, whereas soft-sell approachesbuild an image
for a brand and touch consumers’emotions. An ad trumpeting a special reduced price on a tire or
claims about its performance is an example of a hard-sell approach. On the other hand, the long-
running Michelin ad campaign that shows a baby sitting inside a tire is a soft sell; it symbolizes the
brand’s safety and reliability with an image that touches your emotions. Go back to the four mili-
tary ads in the positioning discussion and decide which are hard sell and which are soft sell.
In addition to brand position, let’s also consider how a consumer response to messages cre-
ates a brand perception. Brand managers use many terms to explain how they think branding
works, but they all relate in some way to communication. To better understand how a brand can
be linked to a perception, we propose an outline of the communication dimensions of branding
using the same six effects we presented in the Facets Model in Chapter 4:

CHAPTER 7 • STRATEGIC PLANNING 207
• Brand IdentityAbrand identity must be distinctive. In
other words it only represents one particular product
within a category, and it must be recognizable and,
therefore, memorable. Recognizing the brand means
thatthe consumer knows the brand’s identification
markers—name, logo, colors, typeface, design, and
slogan—and can connect those marks with a past expe-
rience or message. All of these can be controlled by the
advertiser. The Billings brand identity campaign de-
scribed earlier in The Inside Storyincluded brand re-
minders in places, as well as conventional marketing
communication materials.
• Brand Personality and LikingBrand personality—the
idea that a brand takes on familiar human characteristics,
such as loving (Hallmark, Kodak), competent (IBM),
trustworthy (Volvo, Michelin), or sophisticated (Mer-
cedes, Hermes, Rolex)—contributes an affective dimen- The Billings airport used the new “Trailhead” identity

friendly giant who watches over his valley and makes
sure that Green Giant vegetables are fresh, tasty, nutritious, and appealing to kids. Larry
Kelley and Donald Jugenheimer explain in their account planning textbook that it is impor-
tant to measure the way these personality traits are associated with a brand or a competi-
tor’s brand. They observe, “Sometimes it is as important to understand what your brand
isn’t as much as what it is.”13The point is to profile the brand as if it were a person, some-
one you like.
• Brand Position and UnderstandingWhat does it stand for? Brand strategists sometimes
focus on the souloressenceof the brand. This is related to position, but it goes deeper into
the question of what makes the brand distinctive. As Jack Trout explained, “You have to
stand for something,” and it has to be something that matters to consumers.14Kodak is a
classic example of a brand with a soul, one deeply embedded in personal pictures and mem-
ories. Hallmark’s soul is found in the expression of sentiment. Brand essence is also appar-
ent when a brand dominates or defines its category. Category leadership often comes from
beingthe first brand in the market—and with that comes an ownership position. ESPN, for
example, owns sports information, Silk is thesoy milk drink, Starbucks created the high-end
coffeehouse, and eBay owns the world of online auctions.
• Brand ImageUnderstanding brand meaning involves understanding the symbolism and as-
sociations that create brand image,the mental impression consumers construct for a prod-
uct. The richness of the brand image determines the quality of the relationship and the
strength of the associations and emotional connections that link a customer to a brand. Ad-
vertising researchers call this brand linkage.
• Brand Promise and Brand PreferenceAbrand is sometimes defined as a promise because
it establishes an expectation based on familiarity, consistency, and predictability. And believ-
ing the brand promise leads to brand preference and intention to buy. That’s what has driven
McDonald’s to its position as a worldwide leader in the fast-food category. You know what
to expect when you walk into a McDonald’s anywhere in the world—quality fast food at a
reasonable price.
• Brand LoyaltyApersonal experience with a brand can develop into a brand relationship,
which is a connection over time that results in customers preferring the brand—thus brand
loyalty—and buying it over and over. People have unique relationships with the brands they

consistent from one customer to another, but because of the
vagaries of personal experience, different people have dif-
ferent impressions of a brand.
Emotional branding is one way to anchor a brand per-
ception. As we have said, emotion is a powerful tool in mar-
keting communication and brand liking leads to trust and
loyalty. Branding expert John Williams explains, “Research
shows that reason and emotions differ in that reason gener-
ates conclusions but not necessarily actions, while emotions
more frequently lead to actions.”16Brand liking is the most
powerful differentiator.
The challenge to advertisers is to manage their commu-
nication efforts so the fragments fit together to form a coher-
ent and integrated brand impression. An example of creating
a brand meaning that connects with its audience is the classic
Wall Street Journalcampaign that ran for 25 years in adver-
tising trade publications and established the Journalas a pre-
mier medium for advertising. You can find many of the ads
from this campaign at www.aef.com/industry/careers/2026.
Campaign Strategies and Management
Once the situation has been analyzed and the objectives
stated, planners decide how to achieve the objectives. That
calls for a general statement of strategy. The general strategy
that guides a campaign can be described in several ways. For
example a strategy can focus on branding, positioning, coun-
tering the competition, or creating category dominance.
Maybe the strategy is designed to change consumers’per-
ception of the brand’s price or price–value relationship. The
strategy may also seek to increase the size of the market or

featured leaders in advertising explaining their views on how

medium in which to advertise. sor Julie Ruth explains,17 is that planners have to first ana-
lyze the situation to arrive at a great strategy before racing
ahead to think about tactics. The decision to expand the mar-
ket (strategy) by increasing share of wallet (objective) is implemented through promotional tac-
tics (“buy four and get one free”).
Another factor in the brand communication strategy is determining the role and importance of
the brand’s competitive position and how to respond to competitor’s messages. During the recession,
for example, a number of major brands, such as Dunkin’Donuts, Burger King, and Campbell’s Soup
developed highly competitive advertising. Domino’s Pizza, for example, used an aggressive cam-
paign comparing its oven-baked sandwiches as tasting better than Subway’s hoagies. This is a strat-
egy often seen in economic downturns, which analysts describe as “a dogfight” for market share.18
Other strategy decisions involve the use of a celebrity spokesperson who becomes the face of
the brand. Acrisis in emotional branding happened when celebrity superstar Tiger Woods was
caught up in a sex scandal. That event moved him from one of the most respected celebrity en-
dorsers to a flawed figure with questionable integrity. His sponsors, including Nike and Accenture,
among others, had to decide how to relate their brands not only to his long-time dominance of golf,
but also his loss of honor. It’s not just the brand images that were threatened by Tiger’s infidelities;
economists estimate the loss to shareholders of his nine corporate sponsors as close to $12 billion.19
For another example, American Express sponsored a four-minute humorous online com-
mercial featuring comedian Jerry Seinfeld and an animated Superman that was designed to cre-
ate brand liking. The two sidekicks play the role of neurotic New Yorkers complaining about

such earth-shaking topics as the amount of mayonnaise on their tuna
sandwiches. They also relate the benefits of using an American Ex-
press card. The message is soft sell and embedded in a gag, which
makes the commercial feel more like cinema than advertising. Sein-
feld jokes that it isn’t going to be interrupted by a commercial because
it is a commercial.20
Once the strategies have been identified, the next step is imple-
mentation. Next we discuss the budgeting and evaluation aspects of
implementation. The budget is a critical part of planning an advertis-
ing campaign.

Determining the total appropriation allocated to advertising is not an easy task. Typically, a
dollar amount, say $370,000, is budgeted for advertising during the budget planning process (just
before the end of the fiscal year). The big budgeting question at the marketing mix and market-
ing communication mix level is: How much do we need to spend? Let’s examine five common
budgeting methods used to answer that question:
• Historical MethodHistorical information is the source for this common budgeting method.
Abudget may simply be based on last year’s budget, with a percentage increase for inflation
or some other marketplace factor. This method, although easy to calculate, has little to do
with reaching advertising objectives.
• Objective-Task MethodTheobjective-task methodlooks at the objectives for each activity
and determines the cost of accomplishing each objective. For example, what will it cost to
make 50 percent of the people in the market aware of this product? This method’s advantage
is that it develops the budget from the ground up so that objectives are the starting point.
• Percentage-of-Sales MethodThepercentage-of-sales methodcompares the total sales with
the total advertising (or marketing communication) budget during the previous year or the
average of several years to compute a percentage. This technique can also be used across an
industry to compare the expenditures of different product categories on advertising. For ex-
ample, if a company had sales of $5 million last year and an advertising budget of $1 mil-
lion, then the ratioof advertising to sales would be 20 percent. If the marketing manager
predictssalesof $6 million for next year, then the ad budget would be $1.2 million. How
can we calculate the percentage of sales and apply it to a budget? Follow these two steps:
Past advertising dollars
Step 1: (cid:4) % of sales
Past sales
Step 2: % of sales (cid:5)Next year’s sales forecast (cid:4)New advertising budget
• Competitive BudgetsThis method uses competitors’budgets as benchmarks and relates the
amount invested in advertising to the product’s share of market. This suggests that the adver-
tiser’s share-of-advertising voice—that is, the advertiser’s media presence—affects the share
of attention the brand will receive, and that, in turn, affects the market share the brand can
obtain. Here’s a depiction of these relationships:
Share of Share of Market
(cid:4) (cid:4)
media voice consumer mind share
Keep in mind that the relationships depicted here are only a guide for budgeting. The
actual relationship between share-of-media voice(an indication of advertising expenditures)
andshare of mindor share of market depends to a great extent on factors such as the cre-
ativity of the message and the amount of clutter in the marketplace.
• All You Can AffordWhen a company allocates whatever is left over to advertising, it is using
the “all you can afford” budgeting method. It’s really not a method, but rather a philosophy
210 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND
about advertising. Companies using this approach, such as high-tech start-ups driven by prod-
uct innovation, don’t value advertising as a strategic imperative. For example, a company that
allocates a large amount of its budget to research and has a superior product may find the
amount spent on advertising is less important.
Evaluation: Determining Effectiveness Evaluation is an important part of an advertising plan
because it is the process of determining the effectiveness of a campaign. Evaluation is impossi-
ble if the campaign has not established measurable objectives, so this part of the campaign plan
specifies how exactly those objectives will be measured. In effect, it is a research proposal. All of
these procedures and techniques for post-campaign evaluation will be discussed in more detail in
Chapter 19. Atool for setting these measurable objectives is account planning, which provides in-
formation about what consumers think and feel in order to determine what the plan needs to do
to have impact on the market.
ACCOUNT PLANNING: WHAT IS IT?
As Fallon and Senn outlined in one of their principles earlier in this chapter, the key to effective
advertising is a powerful consumer insight, a central emotional truth about a customer’s rela-
tionship with a brand.
When the Eight O’Clock coffee brand, for example, wanted to know more about its audi-
ence to better target its message, it used videotaped observational research to identify key insights
into how people relate to coffee. Rather than a rosy sunrise, the tapes showed that it was a strug-
gle to get moving. “In real life,” the strategic planner concluded, “people stumble around, trying
to get kids out of bed. Coffee is the fuel that gets them dressed, fed, and out the door.” On other
tapes, it also showed that coffee was the reward for mom after the kids are out the door. “I have
my cup of coffee when the kids leave,” one mom observed. “It’s my first moment to take a
breather. And it gives me energy.”21
Account planning is the tool that analyzes the research to uncover these consumer insights.
Insight—that’s what happens when the light bulb goes off and the planner sees something in a
new way. As in the Eight O’Clock coffee example, the planner struck gold by finding out that cof-
fee is the fuel that gets adults, particularly moms, through the morning rush—and it’s also the re-
ward for surviving that busy routine. From this insight come clues about how and when to reach
the target audience and what to say to her. Here’s the planner’s mission:
• Who?Who are you trying to reach and what insight do you have about how they think, feel,
and act? How should they respond to your advertising message?
• What?What do you say to them? What directions from the consumer research are useful to
the creative team?
• Where?How and where will you reach them? What directions from the consumer research
are useful to the media team?
Account planningis the research and analysis process used to gain knowledge of the con-
sumer that is expressed as a key consumer insightabout how people relate to a brand or product.
Anaccount planner,then, is a person in an agency who uses a disciplined system to research a
brand and its customer relationships to devise advertising (and other marketing communication)
message strategies that are effective in addressing consumer needs and wants. Account planning
agencies are based in research but focus on deriving meanings about consumers. Hall & Partners,
for example, has noted that with the new social media, the walls between private life and public
life have been breached. (Check the company out at www.hall-and-partners.com.) In case you’re
interested in account planning as a career, here is an actual job description for a vice president for
global consumer insights for a major apparel company:
The role of the VP, Global Consumer Insights, is to create competitive advantage by deliv-
ering fact-based consumer/customer understanding and insights that facilitate speed and ac-
curacy of strategic and tactical decision-making across all critical parts of the organization.
In short, turning data into Insights, and then into Action. The planner will accomplish this
CHAPTER 7 • STRATEGIC PLANNING 211
by placing consumers first, integrating their “voices” into the planning process, and creat-
ing sustaining value at the corporate and brand levels.
As the job description suggests, the account planning function develops the marketing com-
munication strategy with other members of the client and agency team and guides its implemen-
tation in the creative work and media planning. Here’s an example from Dunkin’Donuts of how
account planning works to uncover, in this case, the barriers to purchasing fancy coffee drinks.
This mini-case was provided by Regina Lewis, a member of this book’s Advisory Board and for-
mer vice president of consumer and brand insights at Dunkin’:22
We found through our research that people wanted to try espresso drinks like lattes and cap-
puccinos, but they were intimidated and thought such fancy coffee drinks were an ordeal to
order. Dunkin’Donuts, of course, is known for its coffee and we felt that to be a great cof-
fee player, we had to have an espresso line. But our brand has always been hot regular cof-
fee for average Joe. What we realized was that there was a place in the marketplace for
espresso-based drinks for everybody. It doesn’t have to be a fancy treat. We learned that a
lot of people like the milky steamed beverages, but they were intimidated by whether they
would know how to order them.
When we launched our new line, we used the positioning umbrella of the democ-
ratization of espresso. We dramatically changed the way our customers view a latte and
eliminated the whole barista thing. With push-button machines, we created a world where
you can get espresso through the drive-through in less than two minutes. We made espresso
available for everybody and we also priced our drinks under Starbucks. We launched with
a big public relations campaign titled “The Espresso Revolution—a Shot Being Fired in
New England.”
In contrast to account managers who are seen as the voice of the client, account planners are Principle
described as the voice of the consumer. As London’s Account Planning Group (APG) explains it, The account manager is

3. Articulate communication strategies.

5. Evaluate the effectiveness of the communication in terms of how the target reacts to it (so
that planners can keep learning more about consumers and brand communication).
The Research Foundation
As we said at the beginning of this chapter, understanding begins with consumer research, which
is at the core of account planning. Some advertisers, such as Johnson & Johnson, insist that con-
sumer researchers and creative teams need to work closely together.25That is the role, if not the
goal, of most account planners.
Planners use a wide variety of research tools to do “insight mining.” In a sense they are so-
cial anthropologists who are in touch with cultural and social trends and understand how they take
on relevance in people’s lives. To do that, the account planner is an integrator(who brings all of
the information together) and a synthesizer (who expresses what it all means in one startlingly
simple statement). The A Matter of Practicefeature about anti-smoking campaigns provides in-
sight about the role research plays in strategic decision-making for campaigns.

Consumer Insight: The Fuel of Big Ideas
Principle
Advertising is sometimes thought to be an idea factory, but account planners look at advertising A great insight intersects
as an insight factory. As Mendelsohn says, “Behind every famously great idea, there is a perhaps with the interests of the
less flashy, but immensely powerful insight.” Insights are the fuel that fires the ideas. Agreat in- consumer and the features
of the brand.
sight always intersects with the interests of the consumer and the features of the brand by identi-
fying the value that the brand has for the consumer.
Through the process of strategic and critical thinking, the planner interprets consumer re-
search in terms of a key consumer insight that uncovers the relevance factor—the reason why
consumers care about a brand message. Consumer insights reveal the inner nature of consumers’
thinking, including such things as mind-sets, moods, motivations, desires, aspirations, and mo-
tives that trigger their attitudes and actions.
Finding the “a-ha” in a stack of research reports, data, and transcripts, which is referred to
asinsight mining,is the greatest challenge for an account planner. The Account Planning Group
(APG) association describes this process on its website (www.apg.org.uk) as “peering into nooks
and crannies without losing sight of the big picture in order to identify a key insight that can trans-
form a client’s business.”
Mendelsohn describes insight mining as “a deep dive” into the meaning of a brand look-
ing for “major truths.” She explains that the planner engages in unearthing the relationship (if
there is any) that a target audience has with a brand or product and what role that brand plays
in their lives. Understanding the brand/consumer relationship is important because account
planners are taking on the position of the agency’s brand steward. As Abigail Hirschhorn, chief
strategic planning officer at DDB explains, “Our work puts our clients in touch with the souls
of their brands.”26
The account planning tool kit is made up of questions that lead to useful insights culled from
research. Here is a set of questions that can lead to useful insights:
• What is a realistic response objective (perception, knowledge, feelings, attitudes, symbolic
meanings, behavior) for this target group?
• What are the causes of their lack of response?
• What are the barriers to the desired response?
• What could motivate them to respond in the desired way?
• What is the role of each element in the communication mix to motivate them or remove a
barrier?
214 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND
Here’s an example of how data analysis works: Imagine you are working on a cookie ac-
count. Here’s your brand share information:
2009 Share (%) 2010 Share (%)
Choco Nuts (your brand) 50 40
Sweet ’n Crunchy (your main competitor) 25 30
What’s the problem with this situation? Obviously your brand is losing market share to your
primary competitor. As a result, one of your goals might be to use a marketing communication
mix to drive higher levels of sales. But that goal is so broad that it would be difficult to determine
whether communication is sufficient to solve the problem. Let’s dig deeper and consider another
set of data about household (HH) purchases in a year.
2009 HH Purchases 2010 HH Purchases
Choco Nuts 4 3
Sweet ’n Crunchy 2.5 3
What problem can you identify here? It looks like your loyal brand users are reducing their
purchases at the same time Sweet ‘n Crunchy customers are increasing their purchases. It may
even be that some of your customers are switching over to Sweet ’n Crunchy. Astrategy based on
this information might be to convince people that your brand tastes better and to remind your
loyal customers of the reasons they have preferred your brand. Those goals can be accomplished
by marketing communication.
When you combine the two pieces of information and think about it, another insight might
explain this situation. Perhaps people are simply eating fewer cookies. If that’s a problem, then
the communication opportunity lies in convincing people to return to eating cookies. That is more
of a category sellproblem (sell cookies) rather than a competitive sell(set the brand against the
competition). In the Choco Nuts example, it would take more research to know which situation
applies here. Here’s a summary of these two different strategic approaches.
Competitive/Brand Sell Category Sell
What? Challenger brand Leader brand
Who? Loyal buyers Medium/light/lapsed buyers
What effect? Compare cookie brands Compare against other snacks
Objective? Increase share of wallet Increase total category sales
Message? “Our cookies are better “Cookies are better than candy
than theirs” or salty snacks”
The important dimensions account planners seek to understand in planning brand strategies
include relationship, perceptions, promise, and point of differentiation. Most importantly, plan-
ners are looking for clues about the brand’s meaning, which is usually phrased in terms of the
brand essence (core, soul), personality, or image, as the SeaPort outdoor boards illustrate.
The Communication Brief
The outcome of strategic research usually reaches agency creative departments in the form of a
strategy document called a communication brieforcreative brief,which explains the consumer
insight and summarizes the basic strategy decisions. Although the exact form of this document
differs from agency to agency and from advertiser to advertiser, the brief is an outline of the mes-
sage strategy that guides the creative team and helps keep its ideas strategically sound. As the
planner’s main product, it should be clear, logical, and focused. Here is an outline of a typical
communication brief:
• ProblemWhat’s the problem that communication can solve? (establish position, reposition,
increase loyalty, get people involved, increase liking, etc.)
• Target AudienceTo whom do we want to speak? (brand loyal, heavy users, infrequent users,
competition’s users, etc.)

• Brand ImperativesWhat are the important features? What’s the point of competitive ad-

• SupportWhat is the reason to believe the proposition? Ogilvy & Mather explains, “We need
to give consumers ‘permission to believe’—something that allows them to rationalize,
whether to themselves or others, what is in reality an emotionally driven brand decision. The
support should be focused on the insight or proposition, the truths that make the brand bene-
fit indisputable.”

The brief is strategic, but it also should be inspirational. It is designed to ignite the creative
team and give a spark to their idea process. Agood brief doesn’t set up limitations and boundaries
but rather serves as a springboard. It is the first step in the creative process. Charlie Robertson,
an account planner and brand consultant, likens the brief to a fire starter: “The match is the brief,
the ignition is the inspiring dialogue [in the briefing], and the flare is the creative.”27

Objectives IMC objectives are tied to the effects created by the various forms of marketing
communication. All marketing communication tools have strengths and weaknesses. You use
public relations, for example, to announce something that is newsworthy, whereas you use sales
promotion to drive immediate action. Therefore, an IMC plan operates with a set of interrelated
objectives that specify the strategies for all of the different tools. Each area has a set of objectives
similar to those outlined earlier for advertising; these will be presented in more detail in chapters
later in the book that relate to those areas. For discussion at this point, however, the following list
presents the main IMC areas in terms of their primary effects:
• Public RelationsAnnounce news; affect attitudes and opinions; maximize credibility and
likability; create and improve stakeholder relationships.
• Consumer Sales PromotionStimulate behavior; generate immediate response, intensify
needs, wants, and motivations; reward behavior; stimulate involvement and relevance; cre-
ate pull through the channel.
• Trade Sales PromotionBuild industry acceptance; push through the channel; motivate co-
operation; energize sales force, dealers, distributors.
• Point-of-PurchaseIncrease immediate sales; attract attention at decision point; create inter-
est; stimulate urgency; encourage trial and impulse purchasing.
• Direct MarketingStimulate sales; create personal interest and relevance; provide informa-
tion; create acceptance, conviction.

Stakeholders We introduced the concept of stakeholders in the IMC introduction in Chapter 2,
but let’s look a little deeper into this concept. The target in an IMC plan includes more than just
consumers. The term stakeholderrefers to any group of people who have a stake in the success
of a company or brand. These audiences include all those who might influence the purchase of

Here’s a new principle: the Sixth Principle of IMC,which states that stakeholders overlap.Not Stakeholders overlap.

only do they play different roles, they also talk to one another. Employees, for example, may also
be customers, shareholders, and members of the local community, perhaps even elected officials.
Their primary medium is word of mouth, which is another reason why this type of communica-
tion is so important in IMC programs. The fact of overlapping membership complicates message
strategy and demands that there be a certain core level of consistency in all brand messages both
from a company but also within stakeholder conversations.
Contact Points IMC programs are designed to maximize all the contacts that a consumer and
other stakeholders might have with a brand. As we explained in Chapter 2, contact points,also
called touch points, are all the ways and places where a person can come into contact with a
brand, all the points where a message is delivered about the brand. Contact points can be adver-
tising and traditional marketing communication messages, but they can also include all of the

Synergy and Strategic Consistency
Given that an IMC plan involves a lot of messages delivered through multiple media at many dif-
ferent contact points, as well as interactive communication, the marcom planner’s biggest con-
cern is creating consistent messages. The ultimate difference between an advertising campaign
and an IMC campaign is the creation, development, delivery, and evaluation of multiplatform
messages. For that reason, IMC planners are looking for ways to intensify the synergy of the mes-
sages so that the brand impact is greater than what can be delivered by any one type of message.
Eighth Principle This leads to the Eighth Principle of IMC:consistency drives synergy.
of IMC Synergy is particularly important for marketers concerned about the efficiency of their mar-

synergy. Andy Polansky, president of the Weber Shandwick agency, cautions managers to be efficient by
making all communication efforts align with audience interests “so there is strategic consistency
across how you are marketing online, in-person and in traditional media.”29
The problem is that we know various stakeholders have different types of bonds with a
brand, so the message, by necessity, will be different for different audiences. Kellogg’s doesn’t
talk to moms the same way it talks to kids about a kid’s cereal, such as Froot Loops. And it cer-
tainly has a different message for regulators at the Food and Drug Administration and activists
concerned about children’s health, as well as those messages for the investment community in-
cluding its own shareholders. It isn’t that the messages are inconsistent, they are just different in
that they address different concerns and issues of the various stakeholder audiences. What is
common, however, is faithfulness to the brand image and position. That’s what we mean by
strategic consistency—messages vary with the interest of the stakeholder but the brand strat-
egy remains the same.
Synergy is an organizational problem, one that calls for cross-functional planning.In other
words, everyone involved in delivering messages or responding to consumer messages needs to
be involved in planning the campaign so no off-strategy messages undercut the consistency of the
effort.
Looking Ahead
Strategic consistency is the result of carefully researched marketing communication plans.
The actual messages that bring the strategy to life are also a result of strategic planning, but
also creative thinking. Part 3 of this book will review the creative side of marketing commu-
nication beginning with Chapter 8, which continues the strategy discussion in terms of mes-
sage strategy.

IT’S A WRAP
Winning the Coke Zero
Infringement Case
So how well did the Coke Zero campaign strategies work in exciting the interest of young males in a lower
calorie soft drink and delivering the message that Coke Zero tastes similar to real Coke?
To evaluate the effectiveness, return to the three measurable objectives: increase brand awareness, mo-
tivate the target audience to try Coke Zero, and convince men ages 18 to 34 that Coke Zero tastes like Coke.
Within a year Coke Zero’s overall brand awareness far exceeded the goal, achieving awareness with more than
90 percent of its target audience. It succeeded in not only getting the men to know about Coke Zero, nearly
half of the target audience of young men 18–34 tried it, too. The campaign was able to increase consumer
recognition of the taste similarity message. Four out of 10 people who were interviewed recognized the mes-
sage that Coke Zero tastes like Coke. The success of achieving the campaign goals is evident.
You might ask if this campaign was beneficial for the Coca-Cola company overall. Could it be that it can-
nibalized its audience by shifting Coke drinkers to Coke Zero drinkers? John D. Sicher, Jr., editor and pub-
lisher at Beverage Digest, believes the campaign’s effects have been positive. He said, “Forty-five percent of
Coke Zero sales are incremental rather than borrowed from Diet Coke.”
Based on the evidence, this nontraditional campaign, and its unconventional message, Coke Zero was
awarded a Silver Effie for effectiveness.

PRACTICE: WHERE IS
CREATIVE HEADED?
The advent of the new century found companies facing unprecedented competition for the atten-
tion of customers. It also created a huge challenge for marketing communication creatives who
have to create breakthrough messages that will not get lost in the media explosion of the 21st cen-
tury. The problem is that the more messages that appear, the less effective they are. Overwhelmed
consumers often respond by avoiding advertisements and other marketing communication.
The creatives’challenge is to create clutter-busting messages that engage and involve and
touch the hearts and minds of the audience. The ads accomplish this by delivering messages that
people want to watch, hear, and read. As clutter continues to increase and people take more of the
message control into their own hands, the creative stakes get higher. As Professor Karen Mallia
explains: “Words and pictures—those are the weapons the creative team uses to produce com-
munication that breaks through indifference and inattention.”
The Tools in the Creative Toolbox
Every time media evolve, doomsayers predict the death of the current form. Today, some pundits
say the Internet will kill the print medium; others argue we will always have words on paper.
Still others look at the growing domination of visual media and predict the utter demise of the
written word, frequently with the old saw “a picture is worth a thousand words.” (Hmm, that
argument is made of words, isn’t it?)
As long as human beings use language to think and communicate, words aren’t likely
to disappear from advertising. Remember, the advent of acrylic didn’t stop artists from us-
ing watercolors, and television didn’t kill radio. And while styles come and go (modern,
retro, skinny ties, wide ties, high waists, low rise), the tools in the advertising toolbox will
all remain there for the deft to create magical things.
There’s no doubt that most marketing communication has moved from a verbal argument
to a more emotive, visually based mode of persuasion. Look at historic ads on a timeline, and
the average word count drops with each decade.

Even video needs well-chosen words. Writing dialogue for film and video is a particular
kind of writing with a style and rules all its own. But the role of copy in video isn’t always that
obvious. Consider YouTube’s most-watched brand video from 2009, Evian’s “Skating Babies.”
(You can view it at www.youtube.com/watch?v(cid:4)_PHnRIn74Ag.) At first you might not see the
imprint of the writer, but it’s there—in a title card stopping viewers in the middle, and a super at
the end. Without that copy, would the video be as meaningful? How would the brand and the story
connect? The same is true for the award-winning Cadbury gorilla spot from the United Kingdom.
(View it at www.youtube.com/watch?v(cid:4)Ow_o78zjo14.) It wouldn’t make any sense with-
out being anchored by the brand’s tagline, “Aglass and a half full of joy.” It wouldn’t be adver-
tising, either—just a Phil Collins music video. Creating successful integrated communication
means using every weapon in your arsenal. Sometimes the answer is visual; sometimes the
sharpest tool is a word. Let’s not forget three of the most persuasive words in the English lan-
guage, and what they can get people to do: “I love you.” I dare you to find the picture that says
it better.
How do agencies organize, motivate, and inspire their creative people to produce breakthrough
marketing communication that engages its target audience? The three chapters in this part will
help you better understand how the creative side works.

Frontier: A Whole Different Animal
When low-cost carrier Frontier Airlines started up in 1994, it took off with
animals emblazoned on the tails of its planes. Frontier’s distinctive air-
craft tails, all of which depict a variety of different wildlife, have made
Frontier’s brand name synonymous with the airline’s Western heritage. Years of
award-winningadvertisinghavefirmlyestablishedtheairlinewithitstalkinganimals
ontheplanes’tailsasafavoriteofconsumersintheDenvermarketandbeyond.
The economic downturn of 2008 and 2009, however, grounded much of Fron-
tier’s advertising as the airline was forced into bankruptcy because of a cash-flow
problem. Luckily, it emerged from the downturn with a new owner who recognized
the value of the brand and its award-winning advertising.
Frontier’s agency, Grey Worldwide, realized that Denverites were elated that
their hometown airline and its beloved animals would live to see another day. A
narrow window to celebrate this great news emerged. And once again, Creative
Directors Shawn Couzens and Gary Ennis turned to Larry, Jack, Flip, and the rest
of the gang for the perfect solution. The campaign had to be written and produced
quickly and affordably—so it could air while the news was still fresh. And so, in just
a few short weeks, the “Still the One” campaign was born.
This is just one example of how nimble the Frontier campaign is. No matter
what the message, or how quick the turnaround, the animals can always deliver it
in a way that’s engaging and relevant. In fact, the animals have proven so popular,
they may end up being the airline’s single most important asset when it comes to
the brand’s ultimate survival.
So how did it all start? In 2003, Grey Worldwide brought the tail animals to life
by creating a likable cast of characters—each different and unique in its own way.
The humorous ad campaign broke away from the buttoned-up approach used by
most airlines by creating an “episodic sitcom” much like SeinfeldorCheers. As a
result, consumers built an emotional attachment to the brand and its spokes-
animals. And with each new commercial, that connection grew stronger as Frontier
continued to evolve the campaign.

226 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
“Flip to Mexico”
In 2006, when rival airline United emerged from bankruptcy with a multi-million
dollar ad campaign, Frontier decided to steal the spotlight by creating a diversion.
Couzens said, “We wanted to promote our increased service to Mexico. For years,
Flip the Dolphin had been dying to travel to a warm, tropical climate. But we al-
ways sent him to the cold Windy city of Chicago. It was a long-running joke in our
campaign. Well, Flip had had enough. He decided to offer Frontier an ultimatum:
Either they send him to Mexico, or he would quit.”
Couzens and Ennis conceptualized the commercials as a news story which would
unfold and evolve in real time. The “Flip to Mexico” campaign featured ads with Flip,
fake news spots on Flip’s demand that he be allowed to fly to Mexico, staged
protests, podcasts, blogs, Flip’s anthem on iTunes, and a Flipmobile that was con-
spicuous around Denver to generate awareness. Fans caught the spirit and started
demonstrating on Flip’s behalf. The four-week campaign culminated in an ad that
played during the Super Bowl announcing that Flip was finally going to Mexico.
“Leather Seats”
Another commercial shows how the concept was extended with different types of
messages the airline wanted to deliver. Jack the Rabbit and Larry the Lynx an-
nounce new aircraft, new destinations and new seats in one commercial. The bril-
liant copy captivates the audience, as these two characters ponder why there are
not any cows on the tails of the airplanes. They conclude tails with cows probably
would not be appropriate, given the new leather seats.

Effective advertising is both an art in its creativity and a science in its strategy. This chapter explores
how the two dimensions come together as creative strategy—the logic behind the message. We also
examine how the strategy works with creative ideas to deliver a message’s objectives. This includes
a discussion of a planning tool called a creative brief,which provides direction for the execution of
the Big Idea and for the evaluation of the creative strategy. We discuss the characteristics of creative
people and the process of creative thinking, with the aim of showing how you can be a more cre-
ative thinker. The chapter ends with a discussion of the implementation of creative strategy.
SCIENCE AND ART?
Effective advertising is successful because the right media delivers the right message to the right
target audience at the right time. In Part 2 we concentrated on how marketing communication
works and how it’s planned, and in Part 4 we’ll consider the media and how a message is deliv-
ered. In Part 3—the next three chapters—we’ll concentrate on how the message is created. It’s
important to keep in mind, however, that like two hands clapping, media and message need to
work together to create effective communication. In fact, planning the message usually happens
simultaneously with planning the media. Figure 8.1diagrams this relationship.

228 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
Effective marketing communication is not only focused on media and messages, it’s also a
product of both logic and creativity. The message plan, for example, is a rational analysis of a
problem and what’s needed to solve that problem. The advertisement itself translates the logic of
the planning decisions into a creative idea that is original, attention getting, and memorable, such
as the idea of talking animals as “spokes-characters” for Frontier airlines.
Beyond originality, Stuhlfaut and Berman say that creativity is not an open-ended process—
it is directed at achieving objectives. They also emphasize that creative strategy is a problem-
solving process,1 and problem solving demands creative thinking—the mental tool used in
figuring things out. Big Ideas and Big Plans both call for creative thinking.
In their book Creative Strategy in Advertising,Drewniany and Jewler say that an ad “needs

Big Plans both call for that advertising is both a science—in the way a message is designed to be persuasive—and an

Sometimes the new way to present a message demonstrates creativity in the use of media as
much as it does in the design of the message. The nature of creative ideas has changed with the
development of new, more engaging media. For example, you may remember that in Chapter 6
we introduced the Icelandic lamb case study. In it, Ingvi Logason and his Reykjavik agency re-
defined the meaning of “advertising media.” He explains, “We created ‘advertising’in the form
of a series of traditional cooking shows designed to teach new and traditional recipes, but the
shows would be only 40 to 90 seconds long. The execution of the campaign was ten cooking-
show ‘ads’that we strategically ran on various stations followed by viral distribution of the same
micro-cooking shows through Facebook.”

The agency environment is particularly important. As Sasser explains, advertising agencies
represent the perfect “think tank” to inspire creativity and research into creative thinking. Her re-
search has found that agencies are natural incubators in terms of the 3 Ps of innovation: Place,
Person, and Process. She explains these themes as follows:
• PlaceEnvironment research focuses on areas of the agency, office, or workspace setting that
impact on creativity, such as image, structure, culture, integration, and communication. Cre-
ative boutique agencies have playful offices to stimulate their creative team’s ideas. Color-
ful, artistic, and evocative creative department spaces exist even within the most
conservative agency.

• ProcessOutput research focuses on the creative product, the actual campaign. Although
there is some reluctance to say what is creative, most people have their own definition,
which includes such dimensions as originality, appropriateness, and artistry.
Although agencies offer an environment designed to stimulate creative thinking, profes-
sionals working on their own find that the varied nature of their assignments and projects create
their own challenges, as Michael Dattolico describes in his A Day In the Lifefeature.
What Is the Role of Creativity?
Creativity is a special form of problem solving, and everyone is born with some talent in that area.
Media planners, market researchers, copywriters, and art directors are all searching for new ideas.
Ty Montague, former chief creative officer and co-president at JWTNew York, made this point
in a speech at the Effie Awards presentation. He said that even though the word creative is
attached to his job, that doesn’t mean its use is limited to the creative side. Montague noted that
“every client I have ever worked with desperately wants every facet of the development of a prod-
uct and its marketing to be infused with as much creativity as possible.”3
230 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
Montague points to Apple CEO Steve Jobs who, in his opinion, is “the current world heavy-
weight champion in the marketing world and who makes sure that the entire Apple brand stands
for creativity.” In other words, when Apple launched iPod, “the creativity begins with the way the
product looks, works, and feels.” And everything else is a creative challenge—packaging, distri-
bution, PR, the events, the business model—it’s all creative. “Creativity was baked into the iPod
way before the agency got involved.”
Highly creative people range from Henry Ford, the father of the Model T, to Steven Jobs, the
cofounder of Apple Computer, to Lucille Ball of I Love Lucyfame. They are idea people, creative
problem solvers, and highly original thinkers. Creative people are found in business, science, en-
gineering, advertising, and many other fields. But in advertising, creativity is both a job descrip-
tion and a goal. Figure 8.2contains a mini-test to evaluate your own creative potential.
Leonardo DaVinci, Albert Einstein, and Georgia O’Keefe excelled in different fields, but all three qualify as creative geniuses.
How Creative Are You?
By Sheri Broyles, University of North Texas
Do you ever wonder whether you are creative? Does creativity have anything to do with your personality? Your personal-
ity is your own distinctive and consistent pattern of how you think, feel, and act. You may not be a creative genius but
still you may have creative abilities that can be nurtured and developed.
A current view of creativity suggests that the area of personality most related to creativity is how open you are to new
experiences. According to researchers, how open you are to new experiences can be measured by survey questions that
ask if you agree or disagree with statements like the following:
1. “I enjoy working on mind-twister-type puzzles.”
2. “Once I find the right way to do something, I stick to it.”
3. “As a child I rarely enjoyed games of make-believe.”
4. “I enjoy concentrating on a fantasy or daydream and exploring all its possibilities, letting it grow and develop.”
Which ones do you believe may predict a creative personality? Explain why. What can you do to expand your talents in
those areas?

CHAPTER 8 • THE CREATIVE SIDE 231
The next section reviews creative message strategy and then comes back to an analysis of
Big Ideas and explanations of how creative thinking works. It will help you understand how you
can be a more creative problem solver.
The Creative Brief
The art and science of advertising come together in the phrase creative strategy. Awinning mar-
keting communication idea must be both creative (original, different, novel, unexpected) and
strategic(right for the product and target; meets the objectives). It’s not just about coming up with
a novel idea that no one has thought of before, but rather advertising creativity is about coming
up with an idea that solves a communication problem in an original way.
TheRoad Crew social marketing campaignis an example of creative problem solving for a
good cause. We’ll be using the Road Crew campaign throughout this chapter to illustrate differ-
ent aspects of message strategy. The problem was to get young men in Wisconsin small towns
who drink and drive to use a ride service. The objective was to reduce the incidence of alcohol-
related car crashes by 5 percent. The breakthrough creative concept was to use the idea of a road
crew for a group of young partiers who needed a ride on their big night out.
People who create advertisements also make a distinction between creative strategy and cre-
ative executions. Creative strategy, or message strategy, is what the advertisement says;
executionishowit is said. This chapter focuses on creative strategy, and the two chapters that
follow explore the writing, design, and production of advertising executions.
The creative strategy and the key execution details are spelled out in a document called a
creative brief(orcreative platform,worksheet,orblueprint).The brief is the document prepared
by the account planner to summarize the basic marketing and advertising strategy that we briefly
introduced in Chapter 7. It gives direction to creative team members as they search for a creative
concept. The following outline summarizes the key points in a typical brief:
• Problemthat can be solved by communication
• Target audienceand key insightsinto their attitudes and behavior
• Brand positionand other branding decisions, such as personalityandimage
• Communicationobjectivesthatspecifythedesiredresponsetothemessagebythetarget
audience
• Propositionorselling ideathat will motivate the target to respond
• Media considerationsabout where and when the message should be delivered
• Creative directionthat provides suggestions on how to stimulate the desired consumer re-
sponse. These aren’t creative ideas but may touch on such execution or stylistic direction as
the ad’s tone of voice.
Different agencies use different formats, but most combine these basic advertising strategy
decisions. The briefs typically are in outline form, to be filled in by account planners and given
to the creative team. The point is that advertising planning—even planning for the creative side—
involves a structured, logical approach to analysis, which may leave out the intuitive, emotional
message effects. The Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky agency, for example, designs its advertising by
looking for what it calls “tension points.” Its brief asks planners to consider: “What is the psy-
chological, social, categorical, or cultural tension associated with this idea?”
TheRoadCrewcampaignplanningbeganwithacreativebrief.Theultimategoalwasto

trying to drive home themselves. Here is the creative brief that shows the thinking behind the
campaign:
• Why are we advertising at all?To create awareness for an evening alternative ride service.
• What is the message trying to do?Make the new ride service appealing to men in order to
reduce the number of alcohol-related crashes.
• What are their current attitudes and perceptions?“My car is here right now. Why wait?
There are few options available anyway. I want to keep the fun going all night long.”
• What is the main promise we need to communicate?It’s more fun when you don’t have to
worry about driving.
• What is the key moment to which we tie this message?“Bam! The fun stops when I need to
think about getting to the next bar or getting home.”
232 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
• What tone of voice should we use?The brand character is rugged, cool, and genuine. We
need to be a “straight-shooter” buddy on the barstool next to the target. They do not want to
be preached to or told what to do. We need to communicate in a language to which they can
relate. (Words like programmay cause our audience to tune out.)
Message Objectives In planning creative strategies, what do you want the message to accom-
plish? What message objectives would you specify for the Road Crew campaign in order to meet
the goal of reducing alcohol-related crashes by 5 percent?
Some experts say advertising’s role is to create awareness or announce something; others
say it is to inform or persuade.4Hard-nosed businesspeople say the only real objective is to create
sales. In some cases, the objective is to build or change demand for a brand. In Chapters 4and 7,
we introduced the concept of the Facets Model of Effects(Figure 8.3). Here is a review of some
common advertising objectives that relate to the most critical facets of effectiveness:
• See/hearCreate attention, awareness, interest, recognition.
• FeelTouch emotions and create feelings.
• Think/UnderstandDeliver information, aid understanding, create recall.
• ConnectEstablish brand identity and associations, transform a product into a brand with dis-
tinctive personality and image.
• BelieveChange attitudes, create conviction and preference, stimulate trust.
• Act/DoStimulate trial, purchase, repurchase, or some other form of action, such as visiting a
store or website.
Of course, these effects are also driven by the demands of the marketing situation, target au-
dience insights, and the needs of the brand. We mentioned that the primary goal of the Road Crew
campaign was to reduce the number of alcohol-related crashes. Other objectives involved creat-
ing awareness of the ride service program and positive attitudes toward it and establishing a cost-

efficient level of rides in the first year of operations, which involved fund-raising, the solicitation
of volunteers, and other community support. The heart of the problem uncovered by the Road
Crew research, however, was a gap between awareness (don’t drink & drive), attitudes (risky,
scary, potentially dangerous), and behavior(get someone else to drive). The campaign was de-
signed to address this gap and encourage the target audience’s behavior to change in accordance
with their attitudes and awareness.
Targeting The target decision is particularly important in planning a message strategy. For
example, we mentioned in the media chapters that advertisers have a difficult time reaching
youngmen.NewcableTVprograms,aswellasWebandcellphoneopportunities,aredevel-
opingtodeliverthiscriticaldemographic,butwhatshouldthemessagesayinthesenewme-
diaformats?
The target audience for the Wisconsin Road Crew campaign was identified as 21- to 34-year-
old single men with a high school education and employed in blue-collar jobs. They were the pri-
mary target for the ride service because research found that this group is responsible for the most
alcohol-related crashes, they kill more people than any other age group, and they themselves
are most likely to die in an alcohol-related crash. What moves this group? Research found that
many of these guys tended to worry about driving home drunk as the
end of the evening approached and this worry took the edge off an oth-
erwise delightful end of the evening. So the ride service made their
evening more fun because it reduced their worry.
Branding and Positioning The demands of the brand are also impor-
tant considerations. Brand positions and brand images are created
through message strategies and brought to life through advertising ex-
ecutions. Finding the right position is difficult enough, but figuring out
how to communicate that position in an attention-getting message that
is consistent across multiple executions and various media is difficult.
The classic “Think Small” campaign that launched the VWBeetle is
an example of advertising that created a powerful brand at the same
time it carved out a unique position in a cluttered automobile market.
Brand communication creates symbols and cues that make brands
distinctive, such as characters, colors, slogans, and taglines, as well as
brand personality cues. Burger King has taken on market leader Mc-
Donald’s by being cool, as evidenced by the power of its icon with an
attitude—the Burger King king, which is only one of a group of brand
icons that lend personality, emotion, and stories to their brands. The
Geico Gecko and Frontier’s talking animals are brand-savvy charac-
ters that are making the earnest Mr. Clean, Pillsbury Doughboy, and
Jolly Green Giant look like dinosaurs. The difference is that these new-
age characters are self-aware and even a little self-mocking, and they

pharmaceuticals. Another category is riding in automobiles, particularly GM and Chrysler after
their governmental bailouts and Chrysler’s bankruptcy. Both companies subsequently turned to
strategies that reassured consumers that the companies would exist and their cars would continue
to excel in quality.
MESSAGE STRATEGIES
Once you have an objective or set of objectives to guide the advertising message, how do you go
about translating those goals into strategies? Remember, there is no one right way to do advertising—
in most cases there are a number of ways to achieve a communication objective. If you were creat-
ing the advertising for a hotel, for example, what would you emphasize—speed of check-in, size of
the room, hair dryers, mints on the pillow? Rather than tangible features like these, Sheraton decided
to emphasize the emotional side of traveling and shows people greeting one another. Since it’s a
global company, the greetings include hugs, bows, and kisses on both cheeks. The company believes
that its customers worldwide like to be welcomed, appreciated, and made to feel at home.
Planners search for the best creative strategy—the approach that makes the most sense given the
brand’s marketing situation and the target audience’s needs and interests. But how do you talk about the
various strategic approaches you might consider? In other words, how do you put strategies into words?
The Strategic Approach
First let’s review some simple ways to express a strategic approach—head or heart and hard or
soft sell. Then we’ll look at some more complex models that get a little deeper into the com-
plexities of message strategy.
Head and Heart In the Facets Model the cognitive objectives generally speak to the head, and
the affective objectives are more likely to speak to the heart. Sometimes, however, a strategy is
designed to inform the mind as it touches the emotions. For example, in a strategy statement for
Volkswagen’s “Drivers Wanted” campaign, the agency identified both rational and emotional di-
mensions to the VWbrand:
VW’s rational brand essence:
“The only brand offering the benefits and ‘feeling’of German engineering within reach.”
VW’s emotional brand essence:
• Exciting
• Different driving feeling
• Different way of living
• More feeling,fun,alive,connected.

But there are also examples of ads designed to stir emotions that didn’t work because they
were too manipulative or raised inappropriate emotions—think sexy calendars for car parts. It is
possible to manipulate emotions in a way that viewers and listeners resent. For example, a bill-
board for a pest control company located in the heart of downtown that depicted a huge scary bug
looming over the sidewalk elicited many complaints from pedestrians as well as drivers.
Sometimes, however, high emotion works. A 30-minute public service announcement re-

Systems of Strategies Head or heart, hard sell or soft sell—these terms all refer to some basic
ideas about message strategy. But these are simple concepts, and creative strategy is more com-
plex. We’ll look at two of approaches that address other aspects of advertising strategy: Frazer’s

University of Tennessee professor Ron Taylor developed a model that divides strategies into
thetransmission view,which is similar to the more rational “head” strategies, and the ritual view,

which is similar to the more feeling-
based “heart” strategies. He then di-
vides each into three segments: ration

Drama, however, relies on the viewer to make inferences about the brand. Sometimes the
drama is in the story that the reader has to construct around the cues in the ad. Through dramas,
advertisers tell stories about their products; the characters speak to each other (Frontier’s talk-
ing animals), not to the audience. Like fairy tales, movies, novels, parables, and myths, adver-
tising dramas are essentially stories about how the world works. They can be funny as well as
serious. Viewers learn from these commercial dramas by inferring lessons from them and by
applying those lessons to their everyday lives. The Leo Burnett agency built a creative philos-
ophy around “Inherent Drama,” which describes the storyline built into the agency’s archetypal
brand characters, such as the Marlboro Man, Charlie the Tuna, the Jolly Green Giant, and Tony
the Tiger.

CHAPTER 8 • THE CREATIVE SIDE 239
Selling Strategies Advertising has developed a number of strategic approaches that speak to the
head with a sales message. Aselling premisestates the logic behind the sales offer. Apremise is
a proposition on which an argument is based or a conclusion is drawn. This type of message strat-
egy is usually a rational approach, an appeal to the head.
Abasic selling premise is designed to sell a product based on tested principles, or selling
premises, that, as Edd Applegate reminds us in his book, Strategic Copywriting,have been shown
to work time after time.12 To have a practical effect on customers, managers must identify the
product’s features(also called attributes) in terms of those that are most important to the target
audience. Another type of selling premise is a claim,which is a product-focused strategy that is
based on a prediction about how the product will perform. Health claims on food products like
oatmeal, for example, suggest that the food will be good for you.
Arational, prospect-centered selling premise identifies a reason that might appeal to poten-
tial customers and motivate them to respond. Here is a summary of these rational customer-
focused selling premises:
• Abenefitemphasizes what the product can do for the user by translating the product feature
or attribute into something that benefits the consumer. For example, a GM electric car ad fo-
cuses on the product feature (the car doesn’t use gas) and translates it into a benefit: lack of
noise (no pistons, valves, exhaust).
• Apromiseis a benefit statement that looks to the future and predicts that something good
will happen if you use the product. For example, Dial soap has promised for decades that if
you use Dial, you will feel more confident.
Principle
• Areason whyemphasizes the logic behind why you should buy something, although the

reason sometimes is implied or assumed. The word becauseis the key to a reason-why state-
approach, as with a
ment. For example, an Amtrak ad tells you that train travel is more comfortable than flying demonstration, seeing is
because Amtrak is a more civilized, less dehumanizing way to travel. believing, so the objective
• Aunique selling proposition (USP)is a benefit statement that is both unique to the product is to build conviction.
and important to the user. The USPis a promise that
consumers will get this unique benefit by using this
product only. For example, an ad for a camera states,
“This camera is the only one that lets you zoom in and
out automatically to follow the action.”
Most selling premises demand facts, proof, or explana-
tions to support the sales message. Proof statements that give
the rationale, reasoning, and research behind the claim are
used to substantiate the premise. The proof or substantiation
needed to make a claim believable is called support. In
many cases this calls for research findings. With claims, and
particularly with comparisons, the proof is subject to chal-
lenge by the competitor as well as industry review boards.
Other Message Formulas In addition to the basic cate-
gories of selling premises, some common message formulas
emphasize different types of effects. The planner uses these
terms as a way to give direction to the creative team and to
shape the executions. Here are some common formats:
• Astraightforwardmessage,which is factual or infor-
mational, conveys information without any gimmicks,
emotions, or special effects. For example, in an ad for
www.women.com,the website advertises that “It’s where
today’s educated, affluent women are finding in-depth
coverage on issues they care about” and that more than
2 million women visit each month.
• Ademonstrationfocuses on how to use the product or
what it can do for you. For example, an ad for Kellogg’s
Special K and Smart Start uses cereal bowls to demon-

240 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
• Acomparisoncontrasts two or more products to
show the superiority of the advertiser’s brand. The
comparison can be direct, with competitors men-
tioned, or indirect, with just a reference to “other
leading brands.” In the comparison approach, as
with a demonstration, seeing is believing, so the
objective is to build conviction. When people see
two products being compared, they are more likely
to believe that one is better than the other.
• In a problem solutionmessage,also known as
product-as-hero,the message begins with a prob-
lem and then showcases the product as the solu-
tion. Avariation is the problem avoidance
messageformat, in which the product helps the
consumer avoid a problem.

drama in which “typical people” talk about a com-
mon problem and resolve it.
• In the spokesperson(alsospokes-character,brand icon) or endorserformat, the ad fea-
tures celebrities we like (Michael Jordan), created characters (the Aflac duck, the Geico
Caveman), experts we respect (the Maytag repairman, doctors), or someone “just like us”
whose advice we might seek. The spokesperson speaks on behalf of the product to build
credibility. Arecent change in FTC rules now makes endorsers, as well as advertisers, liable
for false or unsubstantiated claims, so spokespersons have to be very careful about what they
say about any product they advertise.
• Teasersare mystery ads that don’t identify the product or don’t deliver enough information
to make sense, but they are designed to arouse curiosity. These are often used to launch a
new product. The ads run for a while without the product identification and then when cu-
riosity is sufficiently aroused, usually at the point when the product is officially launched, a
concluding ad runs with the product identification.
The use of celebrities as spokespersons, endorsers, or brand symbols is an important strategy
because it associates the brand with a famous person and qualities that make that person important.
Michael Jackson is credited with starting a new era of celebrity advertising when he signed a record-
breaking $5 million contract with Pepsi in 1984. Before that time, celebrities were often reluctant
to appear for a brand because they feared it might tarnish their image. More recently advertisers have
worried about celebrities they have signed who might tarnish the brand’s image. Aclassic example
is Michael Phelps, the winner of eight gold medals in the Beijing Olympics, who appeared in the
famous “Breakfast of Champions” series on Corn Flakes packages. After the swimmer was sus-
pended for three months by USASwimming for a photo that showed him inhaling from a marijuana
pipe, Kellogg’s dropped him from the package. In another example, many companies distanced
themselves from Tiger Woods following disclosure of his personal problems. One source estimates
that Woods lost between $23 million and $30 million in endorsements with companies such as Ac-
centure and AT&T.13Temperamental stars, drug and driving arrests, assaults, and loose tongues are

strategies:
• Messages That Get AttentionTo be effective, an advertisement needs to get exposure
through the media buy and get attention through the message. Getting consumers’attention
requires stopping power. Creative advertising breaks through the old patterns of seeing and
saying things—the unexpectedness of the new idea (the Geico Caveman) creates stopping
power. Ads that stop the scanning and break through the clutter can also be high in personal
relevance. Intrusiveness is particularly important in cluttered markets. Many clutter-busting
ads are intrusive and use loud, bold effects to attract viewer attention—they work by shout-
ing. Others use engaging, captivating ideas, curiosity/ambiguity, or mesmerizing visuals.
Curiosity is particularly important for teaser strategies.
• Messages That Create InterestGetting attention reflects the stopping power of an advertise-
ment; keeping attention reflects the ad’s pulling power. An interesting thought keeps readers’
or viewers’attention and pulls them through to the end of the message. One way to intensify
interest is through curiosity, such as using a teaser campaign where the message unfolds
over time. Ads that open with questions or dubious or ambiguous statements are designed to
create curiosity.
• Messages That ResonateAds that amplify the emotional impact of a message by engaging a
consumer in a personal connection with a brand are said to resonate with the target audience.
The women’s campaign for Nike, for example, does a good job of speaking to women in a
way that addresses their concerns about personal achievement, rather than the competitive
theme of the more traditional men’s campaign. If a woman identifies with this message, then
it is said to resonate for her.
• Messages That Create BelievabilityAdvertising sometimes uses a credibility strategy to in-
tensify the believability of a message. Using data to support or prove a claim is critical. The
use of brand characters such as Colonel Sanders for KFC, who was a real person and the
creator of the famous chicken recipe (“11 herbs and spices”), is designed to give consumers
areason to believein a brand by cementing conviction.
• Messages That Are RememberedNot only do messages have to stop(get attention) and pull Principle
(create interest), they also have to stick(in memory), which is another important part of the A message needs to stop

use catchy headlines, curiosity, and intriguing visuals to make this recall process as easy as
possible and lock the message in memory.
Repetition is used both in media and message strategy to ensure memorability. Jingles are
valuable memorability devices because the music allows the advertiser to repeat a phrase or prod-
uct name without boring the audience. Advertising psychologist Esther Thorson says asking the
consumer to make a moral or value judgment also anchors the copy point in memory, such as re-
lating the point to a good cause.14

responses such as love, fear, anxiety,
envy, sexual attraction, happiness and
joy, sorrow, safety and security, pride,
pleasure, embarrassment, and nostalgia.

• Messages That InformCompanies often use news announcements to provide information
about new products, to tout reformulated products, or even to let consumers know about new
uses for old products. The news angle, which is often delivered by publicity stories, is infor-
mation focused. Sometimes this means following a press release with a long-copy print ad or
an infomercial in television. Informative ads and brochures that focus on features and attrib-
utes seek to create understanding about a product’s advantages. Comparison ads are often
heavy on information and used to explain a product’s point of difference and competitive ad-
vantage. Attributes can be both tangible and intangible (see Figure 8.5). The ads for Sunkist
oranges and Harley-Davidson focus on tangible and intangible features.
• Messages That TeachPeople learn through instruction so some advertisements are designed
to teach, such as demonstrations that show how something works or how to solve a problem.
Educational messages are sometimes designed to explain something, such as why it is im-
portant to brush your teeth or get involved in local politics. Learning also is strengthened
through repetition, as in the famous Pavlovian experiment where the dog learned to associ-
ate food with the sound of a bell. That’s why repetition is such an important media objective.
Principle • Messages That PersuadePersuasive messages are designed to affect attitudes and create be-
When advertising gives lief. Strategies that are particularly good are testimonialsand messages that generate word of
consumers permission to mouth about the product. Endorsements by celebrities (the Seinfeld commercial mentioned

for conviction.
sition (USPs) are persuasive, particularly if they provide proof or support. Torture tests,
comparisons, and before-and-after demonstrations also are used to prove the truth of a claim.
Conviction is often built on strong, rational arguments that use such techniques as test
results, before-and-after visuals, testimonials by users and experts, and demonstrations to
prove something. Celebrities, product placements, and other credibility techniques are used
to give the consumer permission to believea claim or selling premise.

FIGURE 8.5
Tangible and Intangible Product Attributes
The diagram illustrates the characteristics of tangible and intangible features. The Sunkist
ad compares its oranges to candy but in the comparison it identifies tangible product charac-
teristics, such as flavor and color. The Harley-Davidson ad uses intangibles—it associates
the Harley brand image with the personality of people who ride on the edge of life.
An association message strategy delivers information and feelings symbolically by con-
necting a brand with a certain type of person or lifestyle. This link is often created through vi-
suals. Aconsumer gets a feeling about the product—who uses it and how and where they use
it—through these symbolic cues. Some advertising strategies want you to identify with the
user of the product or see yourself in that situation. Fashion and cosmetic products invite you
to project yourself into the ad and make a fashion statement when you wear or use the product.
• Messages that drive actionEven harder to accomplish than conviction is a change in behav-
ior. It often happens that people believe one thing and do another. The Road Crew campaign
was designed to overcome a gap between attitudes and behavior. Sometimes an advertising
message can drive people to act by offering something free or at a discounted sales price.
Sales promotion, for example, works in tandem with advertising to stimulate immediate ac-
tion using sampling, coupons, and free gifts as incentives for action.
Most ads end with a signature of some kind that serves to identify the company or
brand, but it also serves as a call to actionand gives direction to the consumer about how to
respond, such as a toll-free phone number, website URL, or e-mail address. Marketing com-
munication can drive people to a website or to a toll-free number to call a company. Similar
to the Road Crew campaign, another form of action is to discourage or extinguish actions
such as smoking, drug use, or driving drunk.
Ultimately, marketers want loyal customers who purchase and repurchase the product as a
matter of habit or preference. Reminder advertising, as well as distributing coupons or intro-
ducing a continuity program (such as a frequent flyer program), is designed to keep the brand
name in front of customers to encourage their repeat business.
244 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
CREATIVE THINKING: SO HOW DO YOU DO IT?
Given how much we’ve been talking about creativity, perhaps a definition might be appropri-
ate. In a research review of creativity in advertising education, Mark Stuhlfaut identified the
significant elements, which begin with novelty but include appropriateness. He says that
“among advertising professionals, creativity requires singularity, uniqueness, adaptability, and
revelation of truth (the ‘aha’moment), which implies authenticity and relevance.” Stuhlfaut
adds that if it’s creative, it is also often generative; in other words, it leads to other new ways
of thinking.16 So creativity can be defined as generating novelty and uniqueness that makes
something ring true.

Creative Big Ideas
What we call a Big Idea,orcreative concept,becomes a point of focus for communicating the mes-
sage strategy. The Marlboro Man with its connotation of Western independence and self-reliance is
a Big Idea that has been worth millions, maybe billions, of dollars in brand equity over the years.
It’s ranked number three in Advertising Age’s Top 100 advertising campaigns of the century.19

planners realized that a Big Idea that reflects the lifestyle of the target audience in appealing lan-
guage and tone can motivate behavior and change attitudes, and Harley connects with the attitude
of the young male audience the campaign wanted to reach.

ment.”22But it has a different meaning here. According to DDB’s phi-
losophy: Ideas have to be relevantand mean something to the target au-
dience. Original means one of a kind—an advertising idea is creative
when it is novel, fresh, unexpected, and unusual. Because it is novel, it
is surprising and gets your attention. To be effective, the idea also must
haveimpact,which means it makes an impression on the audience.
But how do you know if your idea is creative? Any idea can seem
creative to you if you have never thought of it before, but the essence of
a creative idea is that no one else has thought of it either. Thus, the first
rule is to avoid doing what everyone else is doing. In an industry that
prides itself on creativity, copycat advertising—that is, using an idea
that someone else has originated—is a concern. Advertising expert John
Eighmy estimates that about 50 percent of the advertising in the United
States falls into this category.23
The importance of originality may be obvious, but why is rele-
vance important to an advertising Big Idea? Consider the award-win-
ning California Milk Board campaign “Got Milk?” The consumer
insight is that people drink milk with certain foods such as cupcakes. If
milk is unavailable to drink with those foods, people are—to say the
least—frustrated. Thus, associating these products with milk is a highly
relevant idea.
Likewise, why is impact important? We know that many adver-
tisements just wash over the audience. An idea with impact, however,
breaks through the clutter, gets attention, and sticks in memory. A
breakthrough adhas stopping power and that comes from an intrigu-
ing idea—a Big Idea that is important, interesting, and relevant to The idea that some moments, such as when
consumers. eating cupcakes and cookies, require a glass of
milk is the creative concept behind the award-
The Creative Leap winning “Got Milk?” campaign. The creative
concept is expressed both in words and pictures
We all use different ways of thinking in different situations. For example,
in this ad.
the term divergent thinkingis used to describe a style of thinking that ex-
plores multiple possibilities rather than using rational thinking to arrive at
the “right” or logical conclusion. The heart of creative thinking, divergent thinking uses exploration
(playfulness) to search for alternatives. Another term for divergent thinking is right-brain think-
ing,which is intuitive, holistic, artistic, and emotionally expressive thinking in contrast to left-brain
thinking,which is logical, linear (inductive or deductive), and orderly. How can you become a more
creative thinker—someone who uses the right brain for divergent explorations?

and unexpected way.
Second, put the strategy language behind you. Finding the brilliant creative concept entails
what advertising giant Otto Kleppner called the creative leap24—a process of jumping from the
rather boring business language in a strategy statement to an original idea. This Big Idea trans-
forms the strategy into something unexpected, original, and interesting. Since the creative leap
means moving from the safety of a predictable strategy statement to an unusual idea that hasn’t
been tried before, this leap is the creative risk.
Aclassic example of out-of-the-box thinking is Michelin’s tire advertising, which is driven
by the strategic idea that the tire is durable and dependable—language that would make a pretty
boring ad. The creative idea, however, comes to life in the long-running campaign that shows a
baby sitting in a tire. The visual is reinforced by the slogan, “Because so much is riding on your
248 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
tires.” The creative concept “leaps” from the idea of a durable tire
to the idea of protecting your family, particularly precious members
like tiny children, by surrounding them with the dependability of a
Michelin tire.
All creative ideas in advertising involve this element of risk.
Alex Bogusky, chief creative officer at Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky,
one of the country’s hottest creative agencies, says he welcomes
over-the-top work (think the Subservient Chicken and the Burger
King king) because it gets talked about. “I don’t mind spectacular
failure or spectacular criticism,” he says, because those ideas make
headlines, which means everybody’s talking about them. “There’s
so much advertising that nobody knows even exists,” he adds.
“That’s the stuff that I worry about making.”25
Dialing Up Your Creativity
How creative are you? You probably know people who are just
naturally zany, who come up with crazy, off-the-wall ideas. As
Sasser reminds us, “everyone has some level of internal creativ-
ity.” Creative advertising people may be weird and unconven-
tional, however they can’t be totally eccentric. They still must be
purpose driven, meaning they are focused on creating effective ad-
vertising that’s on strategy.
Coming up with a great idea that is also on strategy is an emo-
tional high. Advertising creatives describe it as one of the biggest
emotional roller coasters in the business world. One copywriter
explained that when the ideas aren’t flowing, you feel like fleeing
the country. But when it’s a good idea, there’s nothing better.

skepticism and strong curiosity. Here are a few of the key characteristics of creative people who
do well in advertising:
• Problem SolvingCreative problem solvers are alert, watchful, and observant and reach con-
clusions through intuition rather than through logic.
• PlayfulCreative people have fun with ideas; they have a mental playfulness that allows
them to make novel associations.
• The Ability to VisualizeMost of the information we accumulate comes through sight, so the
ability to manipulate visual images is crucial for good copywriters as well as designers.
They can see products, people, and scenes in the mind’s eye, and they can visualize a mental
picture of the finished ad while it is still in the talking, or idea, stage.
• Open to New ExperiencesAs we said earlier, one characteristic that identifies creative peo-
ple is that they are open to new experiences. Over the course of a lifetime, openness to expe-
rience may give you many more adventures from which to draw. Those experiences would,
in turn, give a novelist more characters to write about, a painter more scenes to paint, and
the creative team more angles from which to tackle an advertising problem.26
• Conceptual ThinkingIt’s easy to see how people who are open to experience might develop
innovative advertisements and commercials because they are more imaginative.27Such
imagination led to a famous Nike commercial in which Michael Jordan and Larry Bird play
an outlandish game of horse—bouncing the ball off buildings, billboards, and places that are
impossible to reach.

The Creative Process: How to Get an Idea
Only in cartoons do light bulbs appear above our heads from out of nowhere when a good idea
strikes. In reality, most people who are good at thinking up new ideas will tell you it is hard work.
They read, study, analyze, test and retest, sweat, curse, and worry. Sometimes they give up. The
unusual, unexpected, novel idea rarely comes easily—and that’s as true in science and medicine
as it is in advertising.
But most experts on creativity realize that there are steps to the process of thinking up a new
idea. One approach called creative aerobicsis a thought-starter process detailed in the Practical
Tipsfeature that works well in advertising because it uses both the head and the heart.
The creative process usually is portrayed as a series of steps. English sociologist Graham
Wallas was the first to outline the creative process, but others followed, including Alex Osborn,
one of the founders of the BBDO agency and the Creative Education Foundation.30Let’s sum-
marize this classic approach in the following steps:
Step 1. ImmersionRead, research, and learn everything you can about the problem.
Step 2. IdeationLook at the problem from every angle; develop ideas; generate as many al-
ternatives as possible.
Step 3. BrainfagDon’t give up if—and when—you hit a blank wall.
Step 4. IncubationTry to put your conscious mind to rest to let your subconscious take over.
Step 5. IlluminationEmbrace that unexpected moment when the idea comes, often when your
mind is relaxed and you’re doing something else.
Step 6. EvaluationDoes it work? Is it on strategy?
250 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
Brainstorming
As part of the creative process, some agencies use a thinking
technique known as brainstormingwhere a group of 6 to 10 peo-
ple work together to come up with ideas. One person’s idea stim-
ulates someone else’s, and the combined power of the group
associations stimulates far more ideas than any one person could
think of alone. The group becomes an idea factory.
That’s how the Road Crew concept was developed. This Big
Idea evolved out of many brainstorming sessions with the project
leadership team, as well as with people in the communities where
the team was working with local leaders to build coalitions to spon-
sor the effort. Alist of names for the project was compiled and guys
in bars who fit the target audience profile voted on the winner,
which turned out to be Road Crew. The slogan “Beats driving” was
developed using the same process.
The term brainstorming was coined by Alex Osborn,
founder of the advertising agency BBDO and explained in his
bookApplied Imagination.The secret to brainstorming is to re-
main positive and defer judgment. Negative thinking during a
brainstorming session can destroy the informal atmosphere nec-
essary to achieve a novel idea.
To stimulate group creativity against a deadline, some
agencies have special processes or locations for brainstorming
sessions with no distractions and interruptions, such as cell
phones and access to e-mail, and walls that can be covered with
sheets of paper on which to write ideas. Some agencies rent a
suite in a hotel and send the creative team there to get away and
immerse themselves in the problem. When the GSDM agency
was defending its prized Southwest Airlines account, the presi-
dent ordered a 28-day “war room/death march” that had staffers
working around the clock, wearing Rambo-style camouflage,
and piling all their trash inside the building to keep any out-
siders from rummaging around for clues to their pitch.
The following list builds on our previous discussion of cre-
ative thinking. It can also be used as an outline for a brain-

• What if?To twist the commonplace, ask a crazy what if
question. For example, what if wild animals could talk?
That question is the origin of Frontier’s talking animals
campaign.
• An Unexpected AssociationInfree associationyou think of a word and then describe
everything that comes into your mind when you imagine that word. If you follow a chain of
associations, you may come up with an idea that sets up an unexpected juxtaposition with
the original word or concept. An ad for Compaq used a visual of a chained butterfly to
illustrate the lack of freedom in competitors’computer workstations.
• Dramatize the ObviousSometimes the most creative idea is also the most obvious. That’s
true for the Voodoo Doughnuts campaign. One of our Showcase contributors, Karl
Schroeder, explained that the idea of magical power residing in a doughnut is new, but the
black magic idea comes directly from the name of the product.
• Catchy PhrasingIsuzu used “The 205 Horsepower Primal Scream” for its Rodeo
headline.

• Play on WordsUnder the headline “Happy Camper,” an ad for cheese showed a picture of a
packed sports utility vehicle with a huge wedge of cheese lashed to the rooftop.
• Analogy and MetaphorUsed to see new patterns or relationships, metaphors, and analogies
that by definition set up juxtapositions. Harley-Davidson compared the legendary sound of
its motorcycles to the taste of a thick, juicy steak.
• Familiar and StrangePut the familiar in an unexpected situation: UPS showed a tiny model
of its familiar brown truck moving through a computer cord.
• A Twisted ClichéThey may have been great ideas the first time they were used, but phrases
such as “the road to success” or “the fast track” become trite when overused. But they can
regain their power if twisted into a new context. The “Happy Camper” line was twisted by
relating cheese to an SUV.
• Twist the ObviousAvoid the predictable, such as a picture of a Cadillac on Wall Street or in
front of a mansion. Instead, use an SUVon Wall Street (“fast tracker”) or a basketball hoop in
front of a mansion (“slam dunk”).
• ExaggerationTake a common situation or item and exaggerate it until it becomes funny (an un-
breakable kiss with the lovers totally unresponsive to over-the-top attempts to break them apart).
To prevent unoriginal ideas,avoid or work around the following:
• The Look-AlikeAvoid copycat advertising that uses somebody else’s great idea. Hundreds
of ads for escape products (resorts, travel, liquor, foods) have used the headline “Paradise
Found.” It’s a play on “paradise lost” but still overused.
• The TastelessIn an attempt to be cute, a Subaru ad used the headline, “Put it where the sun
don’t shine.” An attempted twist on a cliché, but it doesn’t work.
Getting the Big Idea for marketing communication campaigns has always been the province
of creative teams in agencies. Recently, however, with the development of new crowdsourcing
practices, marketers are finding ways to enlist the collective ideas of thousands to come up with
great ideas. Doritos has held “Crash the Super Bowl” competitions that invite consumers to cre-
ate ads to run during the Super Bowl.
MANAGING CREATIVE STRATEGIES
We’ve talked about creative strategy and how it is developed, along with the types of effects ad-
vertising creates and the message strategies that deliver on these objectives. Let’s now look at
management issues that affect the formulation of creative strategies and campaigns: extension,
adaptation, and evaluation.
Extension: An Idea with Legs
One characteristic of a Big Idea is that it gives legsto a campaign. By that we mean that the idea
is strong enough to serve as an umbrella concept for a variety of executions in different media
talking to different audiences. It can be endlessly extended.
Extendability is a strength of Frontier’s talking animals campaign as well. The logic and
structure of the concept is explained by the campaign’s creators in the A Matter of Practicebox.
Adaptation: Taking an Idea Global
The opportunity for standardizing the campaign across multiple markets exists only if the objec-
tives and strategic position are essentially the same. Otherwise, a creative strategy may call for a
little tweaking of the message for a local market or even major revision if there are a great deal
of cultural and market differences.
In the case where the core targeting and positioning strategies remain the same in different
markets, it might be possible for the central creative idea to be universal across markets. Although

the implementation of this idea may vary from market to market, the creative concept is sound
across all types of consumers. Even if the campaign theme, slogan, or visual elements are the
same across markets, it is usually desirable to adapt the creative execution to the local market, as
we explained in the discussion of cultural differences in Chapter 5.
An example of a difficult adaptation comes from Apple’s series of “Mac vs. PC” ads that
show a nerdy PC guy who can’t keep up with the activities of a laid-back Mac guy. It uses del-
icate humor and body language to make subtle points about the advantages of the Mac sys-
tem. In moving the campaign to Japan, Apple’s agency, TBWA/Chiat/Day wrestled with the
CHAPTER 8 • THE CREATIVE SIDE 253
fact that in Japanese culture, direct-comparison ads are considered rude. The Japanese version
was tweaked to make the Apple more of a home computer and the PC a work tool, so the dif-
ferences were focused more on place than person.31The point is that cultural differences of-
ten require nuanced and subtle changes in ads if they are to be acceptable beyond the country
of their origin.
Evaluation: The Go/No-Go Decision
How do you decide if the creative idea is strong enough to justify the expense of creating a cam-
paign based on it? Whether local or global, an important part of managing creative work is eval-
uation, which happens at several stages in the creative process. Chapter 19focuses on evaluation,
but we’ll introduce some basics here to help you understand this important final step in the cre-
ative process.
Anew book on Bill Bernbach and the golden age of advertising, Nobody’s Perfectby Doris
Willens,32analyzed the brilliant advertising his creative team at DDB produced during the 1960s.
In commenting on the book, positioning guru Al Ries observed that Bernbach was a true creative
genius because he had the ability to sort good ideas from bad. Ries concluded, “It’s a trait that’s
extremely rare.”33
So nobody starts off being a Bernbach, but everyone can learn to be more critical about the
advertising they see. The first question is: Is it on strategy? No matter how much the creative peo-
ple, client, or account executive may like an idea, if it doesn’t communicate the right message or
the right product personality to the right audience at the right time, then it is not effective. That’s
the science of advertising.
Structural Analysis The Leo Burnett agency has an approach for analyzing the logic of the cre-
ative strategy that goes beyond just evaluating the strategy. The Burnett creatives use it to keep
the message strategy and creative concept working together, along with the head and heart ap-
peals. This method, called structural analysis,relies on these three steps:
1. Evaluate the power of the narrativeor story line (heart).
2. Evaluate the strength of the product claim(head).
3. Considerhowwellthetwoareintegrated—thatis,howthestorylinebringstheclaimto
life.
Burnett creative teams check to see whether the narrative level is so high that it overpowers
the claim or whether the claim is strong but there is no memorable story. Ideally, these two ele-
ments will be so seamless that it is hard to tell whether the impact occurs because of the power
of the story or the strength of the claim. Such an analysis keeps the rational and emotional sides
of an advertisement working together.
Copytesting Aformal method to evaluate the effectiveness of an ad, either in draft form or af-
ter it has been executed, is called copytesting.Remember: To evaluate the results, the objectives
need to be measurable, which means they can be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of the
creative strategy. Copytesting uses a variety of tools to measure and predict the impact of the ad-
vertisement. Chapter 19explains these tools in more detail.
Aparticular problem that Big Ideas face is that the message is sometimes so creative that the
ad is remembered but not the product. That’s called vampire creativity,and it is one reason some
advertisers shy away from really novel or entertaining strategies. That’s also why it is important
to copytest the effectiveness of the ad’s creative features while still in the idea stage to determine
if there is brand linkage and memorability.
Looking Ahead
That’s a brief review of the changes in message strategy prompted by the economic downturn.
The next step in learning about the inner workings of the creative side is to move to the execu-
tion of message—both copy and design. We’ll talk first about copywriting in Chapter 9and then
visual communication in Chapter 10.
254 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
IT’S A WRAP
Frontier’s Still the One
Frontier Airlines and Grey Worldwide sent an unmistakable message that airline advertising doesn’t need
to be stuffy. Talking and singing animals broke through the clutter demonstrating another lesson: You can
sell your audience and entertain them simultaneously, but accomplishing the client’s business goals is central
to success. Maybe the most important lesson of this work is that a strong brand and a good story can even
help a company survive bankruptcy.
Over time the animals and their quirky personalities made an emotional connection with would-be trav-
elers. A campaign about sending an animal to a warm weather destination is much more fun than a plain
vanilla announcement that an airline now has a route to Mexico. Animals that sing a spirited rendition of
“You’re Still the One” show that, in spite of hard times, Frontier is “Still a Whole Different Animal” and a brand
worth celebrating.
Frontier’s campaigns demonstrate both the art and science of advertising. At the same time the message
strategies for these campaigns resulted in a hard-nosed, business-building effort, the creative ideas also cap-
tivated consumers. The advertising works not only because it delivers on the brand promise, but also because
customers like the airline more because of the campaign and are engaged enough with the Frontier brand to
follow the stories of its cast of characters.
Frontier’s advertising has been recognized with a hangar full of awards. Frontier was nominated for “best
of show” at the International Mobius awards for two years in a row. Frontier was awarded a Silver Clio for the
prestigious “content & contact” category. Frontier won coveted Effie awards as well, including a gold Effie in
the category of sustained success.

Chick-fil-A Gets Creative with Renegade Cows
You gotta hand it to the cows. While the renegade cows do not know how to spell,
they sure know how to sell “chikin” sandwiches for Chick-fil-A. And they’ve been
doing it for more than 14 years in the award-winning “Eat Mor Chikin®” campaign
created by The Richards Group.
Behind the successful cow campaign are copywriters who are responsible for
generating the creative concept and writing the copy, or text, for ads. They un-
derstand this ad lesson: At the heart of every piece of memorable advertising is a
great concept. These creatives know that good copywriting is an art that sells. It’s
the job of copywriters to marry visual with the words to bring the concept to life.
They distill a promotional idea to its very essence and communicate it through their
art. The really great ideas like Chick-fil-A’s renegade cows have sticking power be-
cause they memorably connect with the audience.
As you analyze the “Eat Mor Chikin” campaign for Chick-fil-A, ask yourself why
it has been effective for so many years. Let’s take a closer look.
Chick-fil-A started with a significant challenge: It had to persuade people to
eat chicken sandwiches when everybody else in the world seemed to be eating
hamburgers. Chick-fil-A is not your typical quick-service restaurant chain, and nei-
ther is its advertising. Truett Cathy founded Chick-fil-A with the vision that his
chicken sandwich company would be a leader in the quick-service restaurant in-
dustry. Chick-fil-A has become just that, in part by understanding how to put ad-
vertising to work to attract consumers’ attention and generate a response at the
restaurants.
Here’s another important ad lesson: You do not have to be a big brand with
millions of dollars to have great advertising. The Chick-fil-A “Eat Mor Chikin” cam-
paign is a great example. Chick-fil-A competes in the fast-food category, one of
the largest and most competitive industries. It is outnumbered 4 to 1 in store count
and outspent 10 to 1 in media by the likes of McDonald’s, Burger King, and
Wendy’s.
Faced with these disadvantages in the marketplace, Chick-fil-A and its adver-
tising agency set out to develop a brand campaign that would increase top-of-
mind awareness, increase sales, and earn Chick-fil-A a spot in consumers’
259
260 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
consideration list of fast-food brands. To do this effectively, the campaign posi-
tioned Chick-fil-A chicken sandwiches as the premium alternative to hamburgers.
Chick-fil-A defines its brand: “To choosy people in a hurry, Chick-fil-A is the
premium fast-food restaurant brand that consistently serves America’s best-loved
chicken sandwiches.” The copywriters crafted a campaign to communicate the
brand’s promise. And they did so by creating the beloved bovines that could do
the selling for them.
The company couldn’t outspend the competition. It couldn’t even afford a na-
tional campaign on television, which is where most of its competitors were adver-
tising. So it decided to advertise where its competitors weren’t—on billboards.
Copywriters kept the idea simple and fun (after all, they are selling chicken sand-
wiches) and the copy to a minimum.
For Chick-fil-A and its agency, overcoming the challenge turned out to be eas-
ier than expected. Chick-fil-A’s “Eat Mor Chikin” three-dimensional billboard cam-
paign helped break the fast-food hamburger pattern. The witty use of Holstein
cows encouraging the target audience to “Eat Mor Chikin” instead of beef pro-
vided a bold brand personality that broke through industry clutter. Why? The mes-
sage and execution were simple, the cows were funny, the creative idea was
unexpected, and the call to action was powerful.
In this chapter you will learn what it takes to write effective copy. You will read
about different techniques for a variety of media. You will also learn what it takes
for companies such as Chick-fil-A to create memorable advertising that works.
Did the charming cows successfully moo-ve consumers to eat more Chick-fil-A?

Words and pictures work together to produce a creative concept. However, the idea behind a cre-
ative concept in advertising is usually expressed in some attention-getting and memorable phrase,
such as “Curiously Strong Mints” for Altoids or “Eat Mor Chikin.” Finding these “magic words”
is the responsibility of copywriters who search for the right way to warm up a mood or soften con-
sumer resistance. They begin with the strategy outlined in the previous chapter, which is usually
summarized in a creative brief. Then, working with an art director, and perhaps a creative direc-
tor, the creative team searches for Big Ideas, in the form of magic words and powerful visuals that
translate the strategy into a message that is attention getting and memorable. This chapter de-
scribes the role of the copywriter as part of this team and explains the practice of copywriting in
print, broadcast, and Internet advertising.
WHAT IS THE LANGUAGE OF COPYWRITING?
Some creative concepts are primarily visual, but intriguing ideas can also be expressed through
language; and a truly great Big Idea will come to life in the interaction between the words and
pictures. For example, a long-running campaign for the NYNEX Yellow Pages illustrates how
words and pictures work together to create a concept with a twist. The campaign used visual
plays on words to illustrate some of the headings in its directory. Each pun makes sense when
the visual is married with the heading from the directory but neither the words or the pictures
would work on their own. One commercial in the series included three train engineers with over-
alls, caps, and bandannas sitting in rocking chairs in a parlor and having tea to illustrate the
“Civil Engineering” category; a picture of a bull sleeping on its back illustrates the category
“Bulldozing.”
CHAPTER 9 • COPYWRITING 261
Although advertising is highly visual, words are crucial
in four types of advertisements:
1. ComplexIf the message is complicated, particularly if
it is making an argument, words can be more specific
than visuals and can be read over and over until the
meaning is clear.
2. HighInvolvementIftheadisforahigh-involvement

consideringit,thenthemoreinformationthebetter.
Thatmeansusingwords.
3. ExplanationInformation that needs definition and ex-
planation, like how a new wireless phone works, is
best delivered through words.
4. AbstractIf a message tries to convey abstract qualities,
such as justice and quality, words tend to communicate

communication is called a copywriter. Copy is the text of
an ad or the words people say in a commercial. Asuccess-
ful advertising copywriter is a savvy marketer and a literary master, sometimes described as a
“killer poet.” Many copywriters have a background in English or literature. They love words
and search for the clever twist, the pun, the powerful description, the punch, the nuance, as well
as the rhyme and rhythm of speech. They use words that whip and batter, plead, sob, cajole,
and impress. They know the meanings, derivations, moods, and feelings of words and the re-
verberations and vibrations they create in a reader’s mind. Aclassic ad, titled “The Wonderful
World of Words,” expresses this fascination. Ahouse ad for the business-to-business agency
Marsteller Inc., it was written by Bill Marsteller, another advertising legend. He also was co-
founder of public relations agency Burson-Marsteller. Here is an excerpt from this ad:
“Human beings come in all sizes, a variety of colors, in different ages, and with unique,
complex and changing personalities.
So do Words.
There are tall, skinny words, and short, fat ones, and strong ones and weak ones, and
boy words and girl words.
For instance, title, lattice, latitude, lily, tattle, Illinois, and intellect are all lean and
lanky. While these words get their height partly out of t’s and l’s and i’s, other words are
tall and skinny without a lot of ascenders and descenders. Take, for example, Abraham,
peninsula and ellipsis, all tall.
Here are some nice short-fat words: hog, yogurt, bomb, pot, bon-bon, acne, plump, sop
and slobber.”
In addition to having an ear for the perfect phrase, copywriters listen to the way people talk
and identify the tone of voice that best fits the target audience and the brand. An example comes
from an all-copy ad for British Airlines. Set up like a poem with definite rhythm and alliteration,
the copy block begins and ends with the airlines initials, but in between it lyrically interprets what
“upgrading” to BAmeans to a passenger:

262 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
Like poets, copywriters may spend hours, even days, crafting a paragraph. After many revi-
sions, others read the copy and critique it. It then goes back to the writer, who continues to fine-
tune it. Copywriters must have thick skins as there is always someone else reading their work,
critiquing it, and asking for changes. Versatility is a common trait of copywriters. They can move
from toilet paper to Mack trucks and shift their writing style to match the product and the lan-
guage of their target audience.
As Professor Mallia suggested in the Part III opener, copywriters can rejoice because the
power of words remains strong even with new visual media. She says, “The power of words doesn’t
rest in their volume, but in their clever combination. In fact, the fewer the words, the more im-
portant every single one becomes—and the more critical copywriting talent becomes.” The skill,
she explains, is to “distill a thought down to its most concise, precise, and unexpected expression.
That’s the reason the craft isn’t about to disappear anytime soon, and great copywriters will al-
ways be in demand. Think ‘Got Milk?’and ‘Think different’and see true mastery of the craft.
Each tagline is just two words but rich in meaning and power.”
The Art and Science of Names
The most important word selection in marketing communication is the brand or corporate name.
Low-cost airline JetBlue was originally founded in 1999 as New Air but its founders realized it
needed a more distinctive name. They considered naming it Taxi and painting
the planes yellow, but backed off because of negative associations with New
York City taxis and questionable service. JetBlue has been a good choice be-
cause it states the business (jet (cid:4)airlines), as well as sky (blue) with its calm-
ing connotations.
Many brand names are made up, but it’s not just names that are created by
marketing communicators. The “uncola” position was created for 7-Up and
more recently the True Value hardware chain has proclaimed itself “masters of
all things hardwarian,” a phrase that suggests mastery of a traditional art or
skill.
There is a science to letters, as well as words. Research has determined
that letters with a hard edge like Tor K suggest effectiveness (Kodak, Target,
Tide); X and Z relate to science (Xcel, Zantac, Xerox) ; C, L, R, P, and S are
calming or relaxing (Cialis, Lexus, Puffs, Revlon, Silk); and Z means speed
(Zippo, Ziplock, Zappos.com). In the erectile dysfunction category, Lilly’s drug
Cialis is derived from ciel,the French word for sky and was chosen because it
is a smooth, soft sound that connotes a sense of intimacy. In contrast, Pfizer’s
Viagra evokes the power of Niagara Falls.1
Advertising Writing Style
In almost all situations, advertising has to win its audience, no small task given
that it usually competes in a cluttered environment and the audience is gener-
ally inattentive and uninterested. For that reason, the copy should be as simple
as possible—think “Eat Mor Chikin.” Chick-fil-A’s single line of copy is suc-
cinct and single-minded, meaning that it has a clear focus and conveys only one
selling point.
As the YMCAad demonstrates, advertising writing is tight. Every word

Copywriters try to write the way the target audience thinks and talks. That often means using
personal language and direct address. For example, an ad for Trojan condoms makes a pointed ar-
gument on a touchy subject for its young, single target audience. Combining headline with body
copy, it reads as a dialogue:
I didn’t use one because I didn’t have one with me.
Get real.

How to Write Effective Copy
Copywriters revise copy seemingly a hundred times to make it as concise as possible. The tighter Principle
the writing, the easier it is to understand and the greater its impact. Simple ads avoid being gim- Effective copy is succinct,
micky, full of clichés, or too cute; they don’t try too hard or reach too far to make a point. The single-minded, and tightly
following list summarizes some characteristics of effective copy: focused.
• Be SuccinctUse short, familiar words, short sentences, and short paragraphs.
• Be Single-MindedFocus on one main point.
• Be SpecificDon’t waste time on generalities. The more specific the message, the more at-
tention getting and memorable it is.
• Get PersonalDirectly address your audience whenever possible as “you” rather than “we”
or “they.”
• Keep a Single FocusDeliver a simple message instead of one that makes too many points.
Focus on a single idea and support it.
• Be ConversationalUse the language of everyday conversation. The copy should sound like
two friends talking to each other, so don’t shy away from incomplete sentences, thought
fragments, and contractions.
• Be OriginalTo keep your copy forceful and persuasive, avoid stock advertising phrases,
strings of superlatives, brag-and-boast statements, and clichés.
• Use NewsNews stories are attention getting if . . . if . . . they announce something that is
truly newsworthy and important. (In contrast, Post Shredded Wheat ran an ad with the head-
line “Beware of New” in which it bragged about its original recipe that it had been using for
117 years.)
• Use Magic PhrasesPhrases that grab and stick add power and memorability. In comparing
its paper towels with the cheaper competition, Bounty asked “Why use more when you can
use less?”
• Use VarietyTo add visual appeal in both print and TVads, avoid long blocks of copy in print
ads. Instead, break the copy into short paragraphs with subheads. In TVcommercials, break
up television monologues with visual changes, such as shots of the product, sound effects,
and dialogue. The writer puts these breaks in the script while the art director designs what
they will look like.
• Use Imaginative DescriptionUse evocative or figurative language to build a picture in the
consumer’s mind.
• Tell a Story—with FeelingStories are interesting and they have a structure that keeps atten-
tion and builds interest. But most importantly, they offer an opportunity to touch emotions.
An ad about two brothers, one with cancer and the other who became inspired to become a
radiation oncologist, told their story as they confronted the rare cancer and turned to the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center to help defeat the illness.
Tone of Voice To develop the right tone of voice,copywriters write to the target audience. If the
copywriter knows someone who fits the audience profile, then he or she may write to that person
as if they were in a conversation as the Trojan ad demonstrated. If the writer doesn’t know some-
one, one trick is to go through a photo file, select a picture of the person who fits the description,
and write to that “audience member.”

4. Your goal is to get the audience to like your brand.
Research shows people often transfer their liking of
funny ads to the brand.
Molson Beer won awards for a commercial it created, called “The Rant,” which mirrors the
attitude of many Canadians. The commercial starts softly with an average Joe character disasso-
ciating himself from Canadian stereotypes. As he talks, he builds up intensity and at the end, he’s
in a full-blown rant ending with the line “My name is Joe,and I am Canadian”at the top of his
voice. The commercial was so successful it was played at events all around the country.
Humor is a type of writing that copywriters use to create entertaining, funny ads. The idea
is that, if the humor works, the funny copy will lend a positive aura to a brand. It’s particularly
important to master funny writing if you are trying to reach an audience that’s put off by con-
ventional advertising, such as young males. The Practical Tipsbox provides some suggestions on
how to use humor in advertising copy.

Grammar and Adese Copywriters also are attuned to the niceties of grammar, syntax, and
spelling, although sometimes they will play with a word or phrase to create an effect, even if it’s
grammatically incorrect. The Apple Computer campaign for the Macintosh that used the slogan
“Think different” rather than “Think differently” caused a bit of an uproar in Apple’s school mar-

ket. That’s why copywriters think carefully about playing loose with the language even if it
sounds right.3
In contrast to the good practices in copywriting we’ve been describing, there are also some
things to avoid. Meaningless words (really,very,that,a lot) or words made meaningless by over-
use (free,guarantee,opportunity) are to be shunned in business writing and advertising accord-
ing to a feature on advertising writing on MSNBC.4
Formulaic advertising copy is one problem that is so obvious that comedians parody it. This
type of formula writing, called adese,violates all the guidelines for writing effective copy that
we’ve been describing. It is full of clichés (as easy as pie), superlatives and puffery (best in class),
stock phrases (buy now; free trial offer), and vague generalities (prices too low to advertise). For
example, consider this copy; can you hear yourself saying something like this to a friend?
Now we offer the quality that you’ve been waiting for—at a price you can afford. So buy
now and save.
For more advertising clichés, check this website: www.the-top-tens.com/lists/most-overused-
advertising-cliches.asp.
The pompous overblown phrasing of many corporate statements doesn’t work—it doesn’t
get attention; it’s not memorable; it doesn’t get read. We call it your-name-here copybecause al-
most any company can use those words and tack a signature on the end. For example, a broad-
band company named Covad started off an ad like this:
Opportunity. Potential. These are terms usually associated with companies that have a
lot to prove and little to show for it. But on rare occasion,opportunity can be used to
describe a company that has already laid the groundwork,made the investments,and
is well down the road to strong growth.
It’s all just platitudes and clichés—and any company could use this copy. It isn’t attention
getting and it doesn’t contribute to a distinctive and memorable brand image. That’s always a risk
with company-centered copy, which doesn’t say anything that relates to the customer’s needs,
wants, and interests. It just doesn’t work.
Another type of adese is brag-and-boast copy,which is “we” copy written from the com-
pany’s point of view with a pompous tone, similar to the Covad ad. Consider a print ad by Buick.
The ad starts with the stock opening, “Introducing Buick on the move.” The body copy includes
superlatives and generalities such as “Nothing less than the expression of a new philosophy,” “It
strikes a new balance between luxury and performance—a balance which has been put to the
test,” and “Manufactured with a degree of precision that is in itself a breakthrough.” Because peo-
ple are so conditioned to screen out advertising, messages that use this predictable style are easy
to ignore—or parody if you’re a comedian.
The Strategy Imperative We said in the beginning of this chapter that the creative team begins
with the strategy statement from the client or the creative brief from agency planners. That means
even beautiful writing has to also make the strategy sing. As Susan Gunelius, author of Kick-Ass
Copywriting in 10 Easy Stepsexplains, “Copywriting is about creating perceived needs among a
specific audience.”5If it doesn’t move the audience and deliver on the objectives, then it’s not ef-
fective copywriting.
Furthermore, the writing not only has to be strategic, the claims also have to be tested and
meet basic requirements of truth, as the A Principled Practicefeature explains.
HOW IS COPY CREATED FOR PRINT?
Aprint piece, such as an advertisement or brochure, is created in two pieces: a copy sheet and a
layout. Even though they work together to create a creative concept, we’ll discuss copy in this
chapter and layout in the next chapter.
The two categories of copy that print uses are display copy and body copy (or text). Display
copyincludes all elements that readers see in their initial scanning. These elements—headlines,
subheads, call-outs, taglines, and slogans—usually are set in larger type sizes than body copy and
are designed to get attention and to stop the viewer’s scanning. Body copyincludes the elements
that are designed to be read and absorbed, such as the text of the ad message and captions.

We have suggested that ad copy should be succinct but some respected copywriters, such as
David Ogilvy and Howard Gossage, were successful in writing long copy ads that intrigued their
audiences. Gossage, a legendary San Francisco ad man played with humorous ideas, as well as
words. One ad for Eagle Shirtmakers asked, “Is this your shirt?” Afollowing line said, “If so, Miss
Afflerbach will send you your [Eagle logo picture] label.” The idea, which is explained in the
body copy, is that Eagle makes shirts for various shirtmakers, so you can contact “Miss Afflerbach”
for the official logo to add to your shirt. If you’re interested in more of Gossage’s tongue-in-cheek
ads, check a collection compiled by the LA Creative Club at www.lacreativeclub.com/
gossage.htmlor get his book, The Book of Gossagefrom the Copy Workshop (www.adbuzz.com/
copyworkshop_catalog.pdf).
No one ad uses all of the copy elements; however, they are all used in different ads for dif-
ferent purposes. The most common tools in the copywriter’s toolkit are listed in Table 9.1.
How to Write Headlines
Theheadlineis a key element in print pieces. It conveys the main message so that people get the
point of the message. It’s important for another reason. The headline works with the visual to get
CHAPTER 9 • COPYWRITING 267
Table 9.1 The Copywriter’s Toolkit
• HeadlineA phrase or a sentence that serves as
the opening to the ad. It’s usually identified by
larger type or a prominent position and its
purpose is to catch attention. In the Corporate
Angel Network ad, for example, the headline is
“Cancer Patients Fly Free.”
• OverlinesandUnderlinesThese are phrases or
sentences that either lead into the headline or
follow up on the thought in the headline. They
are usually set in smaller type than the
headline. The purpose of the overlineis to set
the stage, and the purpose of the underline is
to elaborate on the idea in the headline and
serve as a transition to the body copy. The
underlineleads into the body copy as
demonstrated in the DuPont ad: “Find food
that helps prevent osteoporosis.”
• Body CopyThe text of the ad. It’s usually
smaller-sized type and written in paragraphs or
multiple lines. Its purpose is to explain the idea
or selling point.
• SubheadsUsed in longer copy blocks,
subheads begin a new section of the copy.
They are usually bold type or larger than the
body copy. Their purpose is to make the logic
clear to the reader. They are useful for people
who scan copy and they help them get a sense of what the
copy says. The Corporate Angel Network ad uses
subheads.
• Call-OutsThese are sentences that float around the visual,
usually with a line or arrow pointing to some specific
element in the visual that they name and explain. For
example, Johnson & Johnson once ran an ad that used call-
outs as the main pieces of the body copy. The head read:
“How to bathe a mommy.” Positioned around a picture of
a woman are short paragraphs with arrows pointing to
various parts of her body. These call-outsdescribe the
good things the lotion does for feet, hands, makeup
removal, moisture absorption, and skin softening.
• CaptionsA sentence or short piece of copy that explains
what you are looking at in a photo or illustration. Captions
aren’t used very often in advertising because the visuals are
assumed to be self-explanatory; however, readership
studies have shown that, after the headline, captions have
high readership.
• TaglinesA short phrase that wraps up the key idea or
creative concept that usually appears at the end of the
body copy. It often refers back to the headline or opening
phrase in a commercial. For example, see the line, “Need a
lift? Just give us a call. We’ll do the rest,” in the Corporate
Angel Network ad.
• SlogansA distinctive catch phrase that serves as a motto
for a campaign, brand, or company. It is used across a
variety of marketing communication messages and over an
extended period of time. “What happens in Las Vegas
stays in Las Vegas” is a tourism slogan that hints at the
pleasures you don’t enjoy at home.
• Call to ActionThis is a line at the end of an ad that
encourages people to respond and gives information on
how to respond. Both ads—Corporate Angel Network and
DuPont—have response information: either an address, a
toll-free phone number, an e-mail address, or Web address.
268 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
attention and communicate the creative concept. This clutter-busting Big Idea breaks through the
competitive messages. It comes across best through a picture and words working together, as the
DuPont ad illustrates. The headline carries the theme (“To Do List for the Planet”) and the un-
derline (“Find food that helps prevent osteoporosis”) makes a direct connection with the visual.
People who are scanning may read nothing more, so advertisers want to at least register a
point with the consumer. The point has to be clear from the headline or the combination of head-
line and visual. That’s particularly true with outdoor boards. Researchers estimate that only
20 percent of those who read the headline in advertising go on to read the body copy, so if they
take away anything from the ad, it needs to be clear in the headline.
Principle Headlines need to be catchy phrases, but they also have to convey an idea and attract the
Good headlines interrupt right target audience. Tobler has won Effie awards for a number of years for its clever headlines

“Whack and Unwrap.” The next year the headline was “Smashing Good Taste,” which speaks to
the candy’s British origins and to the quirky combination of chocolate and orange flavors. The
headline and visual also tell consumers how to “open” the orange into slices—by whacking it.
Agencies copytest headlines to make sure they can be understood at a glance and that they
communicate exactly the right idea. Split-run tests (two versions of the same ad) in direct mail
pieces have shown that changing the wording of the headline while keeping all other elements
constant can double, triple, or quadruple consumer response. That is what experts, such as ad leg-
end David Ogilvy, state that the headline is the most important element in the advertisement.6Be-
cause headlines are so important, some general principles guide their development and explain
the particular functions they serve:
• TargetAgood headline will attract only those who are prospects—there is no sense in at-
tracting people who are not in the market. An old advertising axiom is “Use a rifle, not a
shotgun.” In other words, use the headline to tightly target the right audience.
• Stop and GrabThe headline must work in combination with the visual to stop and grab the
reader’s attention. An advertisement by Range Rover shows a photo of the car parked at the
edge of a rock ledge in Monument Valley with the headline, “Lots of people use their Range
Rovers just to run down to the corner.”
• IdentifyThe headline must also identify the product and brand and start the sale. The selling
premise should be evident in the headline.
• Change Scanning to ReadingThe headline should lead readers into the body copy. For
readers to move to the body copy, they have to stop scanning and start concentrating. This
change in mind-set is the reason why only 20 percent of scanners become readers.

Direct-action headlines are highly targeted, but they may fail to lead the reader into the mes-
sage if they are not captivating enough. Indirect-action headlinesare not as selective and may
not provide as much information, but may be better at drawing the reader into the message and
building a brand image.
Here are some common types of direct-action headlines:
• AssertionAn assertion is a headline that states a claim or a promise that will motivate some-
one to try the product.
• CommandAcommand headline politely tells the reader to do something.
• How-to HeadsPeople are rewarded for investigating a product when the message tells them
how to use it or how to solve a problem.
• News AnnouncementsNews headlines are used with new-product introductions, but also
with changes, reformulations, new styles, and new uses. The news value is thought to get at-
tention and motivate people to try the product.

A graduate of the University of Florida, Dattolico’s work was nominated for inclusion in this book by
Professor Elaine Wagner.
Here are some common types of indirect-action headlines:
• PuzzlesUsed strictly for their curiosity and provocative power. Puzzling statements, ambi-
guities, and questions require the reader to examine the body copy to get the answer or ex-
planation. The intention is to pull readers into the body copy.
• AssociationsThese headlines use image and lifestyle to get attention and build interest.
An ad for the Motorola Talk About™two-way radio demonstrates the problem of bad re-
ception in the headline: “Help, I Think I Need a Tourniquet!” That headline then draws us into
the underline which makes the point that, if the reception isn’t clear, the headline can sound like
“Well, I think I’ll eat a turnip cake!” This headline, which played with the similar sounds of
words, and other curiosity-provoking lines are provocative and compel people to read on to find
out the point of the message. Sometimes these indirect headlines are called “blind headlines” be-
cause they give so little information. Ablind headlineis a gamble. If it is not informative or in-
triguing enough, the reader may move on without absorbing any product name information, but
if it works as an attention getter, it can be very effective.

“gray”type(ortypethattendstoblurtogetherwhenoneglancesatit)intoalargeblockofcopy.
Taglines are short catchy phrases and particularly memorable phrases used at the end of an
ad to complete or wrap up the creative idea. An ad from the Nike women’s campaign used the
headline “You are a nurturer and a provider. You are beautiful and exotic” set in an elegant script.
The tagline on the next page used a rough, hand-drawn, graffiti-like image that said, “You are not
falling for any of this.”
Slogans, which are repeated from ad to ad as part of a campaign or a long-term brand iden-
tity effort, also may be used as taglines. To be successful, these phrases have to be catchy and mem-
orable, although many corporate slogans fall back into marketing language or clichés and come
across as leaden (“Total quality through excellence,” “Excellence through total quality,” or “Where
quality counts”). Wells Fargo, for example, uses “Together we’ll go far,” which is not distinctive,
could be used by any company, and says nothing about Wells Fargo or its business. Accenture uses
“High performance. Delivered.” which also is nondistinctive and not very memorable.
The best ones have a close link to the brand name: “With a name like Smucker’s, it has to
be good,” “America runs on Dunkin’,” and “Ford Tough.” “Finger lickin’good” for KFC doesn’t
use the brand name, but still is highly recognizable because it connects with the product (fried
chicken) and has been in use since 1952. That’s another characteristic of a good slogan, it is
enduring—slogans are rarely changed. Atrue classic, Maxwell House’s “Good to the last drop,”
has been used since 1915 and Morton Salt’s “When it rains, it pours” has been around since 1914.

Study the slogans in the matching activity. Which ones did you get and which ones
stumped you? Note that eight of the companies are identified with an asterisk. Those eight
have been recognized by Adweek as winning slogans and have been celebrated as part of
the magazine’s annual Advertising Week. In your view, why were they selected for this honor,
and what makes them different from the others on the list that have not been honored in
this way?
One ofAmerica’s favorite slogan winners according to Adweek is the “Don’t Mess with

Copywriters use a number of literary techniques to enhance the memorability of subheads,
slogans, and taglines. These are other techniques copywriters use to create catchy slogans:
• Direct Address“Have it your way”; “Think small.”
• A Startling or Unexpected PhraseTwists a common phrase to make it unexpected, as in the
NYNEX campaign: “If it’s out there, it’s in here.”
• Rhyme,Rhythm,AlliterationUses repetition of sounds, as in the Wall Street Journal’s slo-
gan, “The daily diary of the American Dream.”
• Parallel ConstructionUses repetition of the structure of a sentence or phrase, as in Morton
Salt’s “When it rains, it pours.”
• Cue the ProductFolgers’“Good to the last drop”; John Deere’s “Nothing runs like a
Deere”; Wheaties’“Breakfast of Champions”; “Beef. It’s What’s for Dinner.”
• Music“In the valley of the Jolly, ho-ho-ho, Green Giant.”
• Combination“It’s your land, lend a hand,” which is the slogan for Take Pride in America.

How to Write Body Copy
The body copy is the text of the ad, and its primary role is to maintain the interest of the reader.
It develops the sales message, states the argument, summarizes the proof, and provides explana-
tion. It is the persuasive heart of the message. You excite consumer interest with the display ele-
ments, but you win them over with the argument presented in the body copy, assuming the ad uses
body copy or an overt selling premise.
Consider the way the copy is written for this classic ad that comes from the award-winning
Nike women’s campaign. Analyze the argument the copywriter is making and how the logic flows
to a convincing conclusion. The A Matter of Principlebox explains the logic and message strat-
egy behind the Nike’s women’s campaign, which focuses on self-awareness.

The “Let Me Play” ad is a more recent version of the sentiment expressed in the “Mirror”
ad copy. Nike launched the Let Me Play Fund in support of this campaign after racist and sex-
ist comments about the Rutgers University women’s basketball team by radio shock jock Don
Imus. In response to his offensive comments, Nike ran a full-page ad in The New York Times
than opened with “Thank you, ignorance” followed by “Thank you for moving women’s sports
forward.”

There are as many different kinds of writing styles as there are product personalities, but
there are also some standard approaches:
• StraightforwardFactual copy usually written in the words of an anonymous or unacknowl-
edged source.
• NarrativeTells a story in first person or third person.
• DialogueLets the reader “listen in” on a conversation.
• ExplanationExplains how something works.
• TranslationTechnical information, such as that written for the high-tech and medical indus-
tries, which must be defined and translated into understandable language.

Print Media Requirements
The media in the print category—from newspapers and magazines
to outdoor boards and product literature—all use the same copy el-
ements, such as headlines and body copy. However, the way these
elements are used varies with the objectives for using the medium.
Newspaper advertising is one of the few types of advertising
that is not considered intrusive because people consult the paper
as much to see what is on sale as to find out what is happening in
City Hall. For this reason, the copy in newspaper advertisements
does not have to work as hard as other kinds of advertising to catch
the attention of its audience. Because the editorial environment of
a newspaper generally is serious, newspaper ads don’t have to
compete as entertainment, as television ads do. As a result, most
newspaper advertising copy is straightforward and informative.
The writing is brief, usually just identifying the merchandise and
giving critical information about styles, sizes, and prices.

Posters and outdoor boards are primarily visual, although the words generally try to catch
consumers’attention and lock in an idea, registering a message. An effective poster is built around
a creative concept that marries the words with the visual. For the Coffee Rush chain, Karl
Schroeder created a series of posters to change consumers’perceptions that the shop was merely
a drive-through for fast, cheap coffee. Schroeder’s team did this by promoting a line of cold drinks
with captivating names such as Mango Guava and Wild Berry.

SHOWCASE
These posters for the Coffee Rush group of small, drive-through coffee shops, told newcomers that Coffee Rush sold
more than just “a cup of joe.” The copy, which had to be simple to be read by people in a car, was designed to tease
people into tasting these fun drinks.
These posters were contributed by Karl Schroeder, a graduate of the University of Oregon
and a copywriter at Coates Kokes in Portland, Oregon. He was nominated by Professor
Charles Frazer, University of Oregon.
More recently, the city of Albuquerque used the Burma Shave format to encourage drivers
to reduce their speeds through a construction zone. Today, a construction zone is about the only
place where traffic moves slowly enough to use a billboard with rhyming copy.
Through this maze of machines and rubble
Driving fast can cause you trouble
Take care and be alert
So no one on this road gets hurt.
In contrast to the Burma Shave signs, the most important characteristic of copywriting for
outdoor advertising is brevity. Usually, a single line serves as both a headline and product identifi-
cation. Often the phrase is a play on words. Aseries of black-and-white billboards in the Galveston-
Houston area, recruiting priests for the Roman Catholic diocese, features a Roman collar with
witty wording such as “Yes, you will combat evil. No, you don’t get to wear a cape.” Othersare
more thoughtful: “Help wanted. Inquire within yourself.” Some experts suggest that billboard
copywriters use no more than six to seven words. The copy must catch attention and be memo-
rable. For example, a billboard for Orkin pest control showed a package wrapped up with the
word Orkin on the tag. The headline read, “Alittle something for your ant.”
Sometimes called collateral materials because they are used in support of an advertising
campaign, product literature—brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and other materials—provides de-
tails about a product, company, or event. They can be as varied as hang tags in new cars or bumper
stickers. Taco Bell’s little messages on its tiny taco sauce packages are an example of clever writ-
ing in an unexpected place with messages like: “Save a bun, eat a taco,” “Warning! You’re about
to make a taco very happy,” and “My other taco is a chalupa.”
Typically, product literatureis a heavy copy format, or at least a format that provides room
for explanatory details along with visuals; the body copy may dominate the piece. For a pam-
phlet with folds, a writer must also consider how the message is conveyed as the piece is un-
folded. These pieces can range from a simple three-panel flyer to a glitzy multipage, full-color
brochure.

Radio’s special advantage, referred to as theater of the mind,is that in a narrative format
the story is visualized in the listener’s imagination. Radio copywriters imagine they are writing a
musical play that will be performed before an audience whose eyes are closed. The copywriter
has all the theatrical tools of voices, sound effects, and music, but no visuals. How the characters
look and where the scene is set come from their listeners’imaginations.
As an example of theater of the mind, consider a now-classic commercial written by hu-
morist Stan Freberg for the Radio Advertising Bureau. The spot opens with an announcer ex-
plaining that Lake Michigan will be drained and filled with hot chocolate and a 700-foot mountain
of whipped cream. The Royal Canadian Air Force will fly overhead and drop a ten-ton
maraschino cherry, all to the applause of 25,000 screaming extras. The point is that things that
can’t be created in real life can be created by radio in the imagination of listeners.
The Radio Advertising Bureau has used the slogan “I saw it on the radio” to illustrate the
power of radio’s ability to evoke rich images in the listener’s mind. Research indicates that the
use of imagery in radio advertising leads to high levels of attention and more positive general at-
titudes toward the ad and its claims.9Even though we’re talking about imagery, it is produced by
the copywriter’s masterful use of the tools of audio as discussed next.
Tools of Radio Copywriting
Print copywriters use a variety of tools—headlines, body copy, slogans, and so forth—to write
their copy. In radio advertising, the tools are the audio elements the copywriter uses to craft a
commercial: voice, music, and sound effects.
Voice The most important element in radio advertising is the human voice, which is heard in
songs, spoken dialogue, and announcements. Most commercials use an announcereither as the
central voice or at the closing to wrap up the product identification. The voices the copywriter
specifies help listeners “see” the personalities in the commercial. The copywriter understands that
we imagine people and what they are like based on their voices. Dialogue uses character voices
to convey an image of the speaker: a child, an old man, an executive, a Little League baseball
player, a rock singer, and so forth. Copywriters specify voices for commercials based on the
evocative qualities they contribute to the message. Chicago radio announcer Ken Nordine’s voice
was once described as sounding like warm chocolate; singer Ray Charles was described as hav-
ing a charcoal voice.

276 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
Music Similar to movie scriptwriters, radio copywriters have a sense of the imagery of music
and the role it plays in creating dramatic effects. Music can be used behind the dialogue to create
mood and establish the setting. Any mood, from that of a circus to a candlelit dinner, can be con-
veyed through music. The primary use of music is a jingle,which is a commercial in song, like
the Oscar Mayer songs. Radio copywriters understand the interplay of catchy phrases and “hum-
mable” music to create little songs that stick in our minds. Anything consumers can sing along
with helps them remember and get involved with the message.
Advertisers can have a piece of music composed for a commercial or borrow it from previ-
ously recorded songs. Numerous music libraries sell stock musicthat is not copyrighted. Acustom-
made jingle created for a single advertiser can cost $10,000 or more. In contrast, many jingle
housescreate “syndicated” jingles made up of a piece of music sold to several different local ad-
vertisers in different markets around the country for as little as $1,000 or $2,000.
One of the most famous jingles of all time was the song “I’d like to teach the world to sing”
produced for Coca-Cola in 1969 by its agency, McCann-Erickson. Agreat example of a jingle that
was an instant hit worldwide, it later was recorded as a pop song without the Coke reference and
sold millions of copies. Called “Hilltop,” the TVcommercial shows young people singing “I’d
like to buy the world a Coke” on a hilltop in Italy. Surveys continue to identify it as one of the
best commercials of all time. It is still run by Coke on special occasions and the sheet music con-
tinues to sell more than 30 years after the song was first written. You can read more about this

The Practice of Radio Copywriting
The following guidelines for writing effective radio commercials address the distinctive charac-
teristics of radio advertising:
• Keep It PersonalRadio advertising has an advantage over print—the human voice. The
copy for radio ads should use conversational language—as if someone is “talking with” the
consumer rather than “selling to” the consumer.
• Speak to Listeners’InterestsRadio offers specialized programming to target markets. Lis-
teners mostly tune in to hear music, but talk radio is popular, too. There are shows on health,
pets, finance, politics—whatever interests people. Copywriters design commercials to speak
to that audience interest and use the appropriate music and tone of voice.
• Wake Up the InattentiveMost people who are listening to the radio are doing something
else at the same time, such as jogging, driving, or fixing breakfast. Radio spots are designed
to break through and capture attention in the first three seconds with sound effects, music,
questions, commands, or something unexpected.
• Make It MemorableTo help the listener remember what you are selling, commercial
copy should mention the name of the product emphatically and repeat it. An average of
three mentions in a 30-second commercial and five mentions in a 60-second commercial
are recommended, as long as the repetition is not done in a forced and/or annoying man-
ner. Copywriters use taglines and other key phrases to lock the product in consumers’
memories.
• Include Call to ActionThe last thing listeners hear is what they tend to remember, so copywrit-
ers make sure the product is it. In radio that’s particularly important since there is no way to

Tools of Television Copywriting
Television copywriters have two primary toolkits: visual and audio. Both words and pictures are
designed to create exactly the right impact. Because of the number of visual and audio elements,
as well as the many ways they can be combined, a television commercial is one of the most com-
plex of all advertising forms. It is also an ideal form for storytelling. Copywriters who write
scripts for television commercials are masters of the emotional moment as researcher Charles
Young explains in the A Matter of Practicefeature.
Video and Motion When we watch a commercial, we are more aware of what we’re seeing than
anything else. Copywriters keep in mind that visuals and motion, the silent speech of film, should
convey as much of the message—the Big Idea—as possible. Likewise, emotion, which is the ef-
fect created by storytelling, is expressed convincingly in facial expressions, gestures, and other
body language. Because television is theatrical, many of the copywriter’s tools, such as charac-
ters, costumes, sets and locations, props, lighting, optical and computerized special effects, and
on-screen graphics, are similar to those you would use in a play, television show, or movie.
Audio As in radio, the three audio elements are music, voices, and sound effects, but they are
used differently in television commercials because they are connected to a visual image. The copy-
writer may have an announcer speak directly to the viewer or engage in a dialogue with another
person, who may or may not be on camera. The copywriter writes the words they will say and
blocks out on paper how this “talk” happens. Acommon manipulation of the camera–announcer
relationship is the voice-over,in which an announcer who is not visible describes some kind of
action on the screen. Sometimes a voice is heard off camera, which means you can’t see the
speaker and the voice is coming from the side, behind, or above.

280 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
Dialogue, both in radio and television, is an interesting challenge for copywriters who try to
keep the words natural and the interaction interesting. In the Frontier Airlines talking animals
commercials, for example, the repartee between the characters is as important to the message as
the words themselves. Note how the dialogue between Jack the Rabbit and Larry the Lynx
bounces back and forth in the “Leather Seats” commercial. Also note the brand identity text in
the middle. This structure is called a “donut” because it uses an attention-getting idea to open and
close with brand copy embedded in the middle.
Jack the Rabbit: I’ll tell you, Lar, the tarmac never looked better.
Larry the Lynx: I’ll say.
Jack: New planes. New cities. New leather seats.
Larry: Pretty exciting stuff, huh?
Jack: Hey, uh, Larry, what’s leather made from?
Larry: Cowhide.
Jack: Oh. So that’s why there are no cows on the tails of our planes.

Music is also important in most commercials. Sometimes it is just used as background; at
other times, the song is the focus of the commercial. In recognition of the role of music in adver-
tising, Universal Music released a CD in 2001 called “As Seen on TV: Songs from Commercials,”
a collection of tunes that have become popular—or resurrected—thanks to their use in TVcom-
mercials. Included among the 20 songs are “Mr. Roboto” by Styx, “Right Here, Right Now” by
Fatboy Slim, “Lust for Life” by Iggy Pop, and “Got to Give It Up” by Marvin Gaye. All of these
songs have been used effectively in a television commercial. Clash’s “London Calling” song be-
came the theme for a highly successful sales event for Jaguar.
Other TV Tools The creative tools examined next are the setting, casting, costumes, props, and
lighting—all of which the copywriter must describe in the script. The setting, or set,is where the
action takes place. It can be something in the studio, from a simple tabletop to a constructed set
that represents a storefront or the inside of a home, or it can be a computer creation layered
behind the action. Commercials shot outside the studio are said to be filmed on location,which
means the entire crew and cast are transported somewhere away from the studio.
For many commercials, the most important element is the people, who are called talent.
Finding the right person for each role is called casting.People can be cast as:
• Announcers(either onstage or offstage), presenters, introducers.
• Spokespersons(or“spokes-animals,”suchastheGeicoGeckoandtheFrontiertalking
animals).
• Character Types(old woman, baby, skin diver, police officer).
• Celebrities,such as Catherine Zeta-Jones and the Black Eyed Peas.
Costumes and makeup can be an important part of the story depending on the characteriza-
tions in the commercial. Of course, historical stories need period costumes, but modern scenes
may also require special clothing such as golf outfits, swimsuits, or cowboy boots. Makeup may
be important if you need to change a character from young to old. The copywriter must specify
all of these details in the script. The director usually manipulates the lighting, but the copywriter
might specify special lighting effects in the script. For example, you might read “Intense bright
CHAPTER 9 • COPYWRITING 281
light as though reflected from snow” or “Light flickering on people’s faces as if reflecting from
a television screen.”
Copywriters might also have to specify the commercial’s pace—how fast or slowly the ac-
tion progresses. Some messages are best developed at a languid pace; others work better when
presented at an upbeat, fast pace. Research has found that the pace of TVcommercials has been
steadily getting faster since the mid-20th century. Why do you suppose that might be?
Planning the TV Commercial
Copywriters must plan how long the commercial will be, what shots will appear in each scene, what
the key visual will be, and where and how to shoot the commercial. Other key decisions the copy-
writer must consider in planning a commercial are the length, number of scenes, and key frames.
The common lengths of TV commercials are 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 seconds. The 10-, 15-, and
20-second lengths are used for reminders and product or station identification. The 60-second spot,
which is common in radio, has almost disappeared in television because of the increasing cost of
airtime. The most common length for a TVcommercial is 30 seconds.
Scenes and Key Frames Acommercial is planned in scenes—segments of action that occur in
a single location. Ascene may include several shots from different angles. A30-second commer-
cial usually is planned with four to six scenes, but a fast-paced commercial may have many more.
Because television is a visual medium, the message is often developed as a key visualthat con-
veys the heart of the concept. The key frameis the shot that sticks in the mind and becomes the
image viewers remember when they think about the commercial. Copywriter Lara Mann de-
scribes a campaign she worked on for the Florida Film Festival. The campaign used television
commercials but they were supported by posters with key frames from the commercials. The TV
tagline “Where Will It Take You?” appears on the posters to express the thought that the Film Fes-
tival takes you to some exotic locations.
Copywriters need to answer many questions when planning a television spot. How much
product information should there be in the commercial? Should the action be fast or slow? Is it
wise to defy tradition and create unusual, even controversial ads as Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky did
with Old Navy’s SuperModelquins? How intrusive should the ad be?
Every producer and director will respond to these questions differently, depending on per-
sonal preferences and the advertising objectives. Nevertheless, these general principles as out-
lined by Drewniany and Jewler in their creative strategy book and earlier editions of their book
are relevant for most effective television commercials:11
• What’s the big ideayou need to get across? In 30 seconds you barely have time to do much
more than that. Alternative concepts are also tested as key visuals in developing the idea for the
commercial. For each idea, a card with the key visual drawn on it is given to a respondent, along
with a paragraph that describes the concept and how it will be played out in the commercial.
• What’s the benefitof that big idea, and who does it benefit? Connect the big idea back to the
target audience.
• Howcanyouturnthatbenefitintoavisualelement?Thisvisualiswhatsticksinpeo-
ple’sminds.
• Howcanyougaintheinterestofviewersatthebeginning?Thefirstthreesecondsare
critical.
• How can you focus on a key visual,a scene that encapsulates your entire selling message
into one neat package?
• Is the commercial single-minded?Tell one important story per commercial. Tell it clearly,
tell it memorably, and involve your viewer.
• Is the product identified and shownin close-up at the end?
Scripts, Storyboards, and Photoboards Two documents are used to plan commercials: a television
script prepared by the copywriter and a storyboard drawn by the art director. Similar to a radio script,
atelevision scriptis the written version of the commercial’s plan. It contains all the words, dialogue,
lyrics (if important to the ad message), instructions, and descriptions of the details we’ve been
discussing—sets, costumes, lighting, and so forth. For television commercials that use dialogue, the
script is written in two columns, with the audio on the right and the video on the left.
282 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
The key to the structure of a television script is the relationship between the audio and the
video. The dialogue is typed as usual, but the instructions and labels are typed in all-capital let-
ters. The video part of the script includes descriptions of key frames, characters, actions, and cam-
era movements in the commercial. Sometimes the script is in a two-column format with the video
instructions on the left and the audio in the right column.
Astoryboard,which is a visual plan or layout of the commercial, is drawn (by hand or on
the computer) to show the number of scenes, composition of the shots, and progression of the ac-
tion. The script information usually appears below the key images. Its purpose is to guide the film-
ing. Aphotoboarduses photographic stills instead of art to illustrate the progression of images.
It’s created from the still photos or frames from the filming and is used to present to clients. (See
the Frontier commercial in Chapter 8.)
HOW DIFFERENT IS COPYWRITING FOR THE INTERNET?
The Internet is more interactive than any other mass medium. Not only do viewers initiate the
contact, they can send e-mail on many websites. This makes Web advertising more like two-way
communication, and that’s a major point of difference from other advertising forms. As a result,
the Web copywriter is challenged to attract people to the site and to manage a dialogue-based
communication experience. In addition to targeting messages to audiences, Web advertisers have
to be prepared to listen and respond to those audiences. That’s a major shift in how Web market-
ing communicators think about advertising.

vowel-free words. Cell-phone company Motorola follows that trend in naming new products such
as RAZR, PEBL, and RCKR.
For banners and other formats that look like advertising and seek to attract someone to a com-
pany’s website, verbosity is a killer. In that situation, no one wants to read a lot of type online. That
means Web copywriters have to be able to write everything from catchy phrases for banners to copy
that works like traditional advertisements, brochures, or catalogs. Abasic principle, however, is that
good writing is good writing, whether it is being done for traditional advertising media or for the Web.
Websites
The challenge for Web advertisers is to understand the user’s situation and design messages that
fit their needs and interests. However, the Web is an information medium and users come to it, in
some cases, for reference information—formats that look a lot like catalogs, or even encyclope-
dias. Corporate or organizational websites are designed to provide information, as well as image
cues, so strategies that organize information and package it for easy accessibility are important.
Key wordsare used to help visitors or surfers(rather than readers, listeners, or viewers) search
for the site online, as well as within the site for the information they need.
Creativity is also valued both to entice visitors, but also to keep them actively involved with
the site. For example, the “Don’t Mess with Texas” anti-litter website mentioned early as an
Adweekfavorite invites visitors into the campaign with advertising materials, testimonials, letters,
special events, and involvement programs. It uses colorful animation to create action and spark in-
terest. The language reflects the tough-talking slogan. For example, one section asks, “Who wants
to live in a pig sty?” and “Why swim in an ashtray?” Check it out at http://dontmesswithtexas.org.

2. Use an involvement devicesuch as a challenge or contest.
3. Change the offer frequently,perhaps even daily. One of the reasons people surf the Inter-
net is to find out what’s happening now. Good ads exploit “nowness” and “newsiness.”
4. Keep the writing succinctbecause most surfers have short attention spans and get bored easily.

6. Use the advertisementto solicit information and opinions from users as part of your re-

Sometimes banners provide brand reminder information only, like a billboard, but they usually
also invite viewers to clickon the banner to link to an ad or the advertiser’s home page. The effec-
tiveness of such efforts is monitored in part by the number of click-throughs.Their creators make ban-
ners entertaining by using multimedia effects such as animation and sound, interactivity, emotional
appeals, color, and provocative headlines. One mistake copywriters sometimes make, however, is to
forget to include the company name or brand in the banner or ad. Surfers should be able to tell imme-
diately what product or brand the banner is advertising. Effective banner ads satisfy the need for en-
tertainment, information, and context (a link to a product), and often use promotional incentives, such
as prizes or gifts, to motivate visitors to click through to the sponsor’s website13to drive action.
Internet Ads
Similar in some ways to traditional advertising, Internet ads are designed to create awareness and
interest in a product and build a brand image. In terms of creating interest, good copywriting
works well in any medium, including the Internet. The “Ocean Speaks” ads in The Inside Story
at www.pearsonhighered.com/moriarty illustrates how the same writing style can transfer from
print to the Internet and maintain a consistent brand personality. The scuba diving industry wanted
to revive interest in the sport of scuba, both with current divers and potential newcomers. The ob-
jective of this striking campaign was to move people from print to the company’s website.
Art director Chris Hutchinson explains, “We created a campaign in the literal voice of the
ocean. The Ocean irreverently compares itself to the dull world up above and invites people to
come down for a visit. Instead of using traditional beauty shots of scuba diving, we commissioned
surreal organic underwater scenes.” The ads were featured in Archive,an international collection
of the best advertising, television, and poster images.
In contrast to the Ocean speaking campaign, Burton Snowboards uses copy that speaks in
the voice of the product’s user, but the copy also creates an association with a distinctive brand
and user personality.
It also uses its corporate mission statement as copy that speaks in the same tone of voice.

LESSONS ABOUT COPYWRITING
As discussed throughout this chapter, the copywriter’s job is to find a memorable way to express
the creative concept. All of a copywriter’s talent will do no good if the audience cannot under-
stand the “magic words.” Understanding the words, as well as the creative idea, is particularly
complicated in global brand communication.
Writing for a Global Brand
Language affects the creation of the advertising, which is a problem for global campaigns. En-
glish is more economical than many other languages. This creates a major problem when the
space for copy is laid out for English and one-third more space is needed for French or Spanish.
However, English does not have the subtlety of other languages such as Greek, Chinese, or
French. Those languages have many different words for situations and emotions that do not trans-
late precisely into English. Standardizing the copy content by translating the appeal into the
284 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
language of the foreign market is fraught with possible communication blunders. It is rare to find
a copywriter who is fluent in both the domestic and foreign language and familiar with the cul-
ture of the foreign market.
Headlines in any language often rely on humor or a play on words, themes that are relevant
to one country, or slang. Because these verbal techniques don’t cross borders well, copywriters
remove them from the advertising unless the meaning or intent can be re-created in other lan-
guages. For this reason, international campaigns are not literally translated word by word. In-
stead, a copywriter usually rewrites them in the second language. An ad for a Rome laundry
shows how a poor translation can send the wrong message: “Ladies, leave your clothes here and
spend the afternoon having a good time.”
Although computer words and advertising terms are almost universally of English deriva-
tion, some languages simply do not have words equivalent to other English expressions. Since
1539 the French have had legislation to keep their language “pure” and now have a government
agency to prevent words, especially English words, from corrupting the French language. The
wordsmarketingandweekend,unacceptable to the French government agency, are translated lit-
erally as “study the market” (or “pertaining to trade”) and “end of the week,” respectively.
Experience suggests that the most reasonable solution to the language problem is to use
bilingual copywriters who understand the full meaning of the English text and can capture the
essence of the message in the second language. It takes a brave and trusting international creative
director to approve copy he or she doesn’t understand but is assured is right. Aback translation
of the ad copy from the foreign language into the domestic one is always a good idea, but it sel-
dom conveys a complete cultural interpretation.
The most recent announcement on the global stage is the opening up of the Internet to non-
Roman letters, such as those used in Chinese, Korean, and Arabic. It’s a challenge to develop
translations for these languages so that a posting can be read in its original language, as well as
in Roman letter alphabets, but the technology is making that possible.
Looking Ahead
The most important enduring principle is that in a Big Idea the meaning emerges from the way
the words and images reinforce one another. We’ve explored the practices and principles of copy-
writing. In the next chapter we’ll introduce the role of the art director and explain the important
role of visual communication.

After the initial rollout as a three-dimensional billboard, the campaign continued to evolve and make its
way into every point of contact with the customer. A standup cow became part of the in-store kit, along with
banners, table tents, cups, bags, and register toppers. The campaign has added direct mail and ads, promo-
tions, events, TV, radio, the Internet, clothing, and merchandise. Calendars have been so popular that pro-
duction numbers have topped 2.4 million. Anyone brave enough to show up at one of the chain’s restaurants
dressed as a cow on the annual Cow Appreciation Day gets a free Chick-fil-A meal.
CHAPTER 9 • COPYWRITING 285
The iconic cows and their quirky antics have become such a key symbol of Chick-fil-A’s marketing com-
munication that they were recognized as one of America’s most popular advertising icons in a public vote
sponsored by Advertising Week. They even earned a spot on New York’s Madison Avenue Advertising Walk
of Fame.
Chick-fil-A’s lighthearted, unconventional campaign has helped increase sales every year. Sales have in-
creased almost 600 percent since the campaign’s launch. Same-store sales more than tripled the precampaign
levels. Sales percentage increases beat the competition hoofs down.
Oh yes, the campaign also won a herd of awards, including induction into the Outdoor Advertising As-
sociation of America’s Obie Hall of Fame, a Silver Lion at the Cannes International Advertising Festival, and
two Effies, including one for its sustained success. That’s one way to milk the cows for all they’re worth.

A Strong Mint with a Curious Past
Shortly after the United States fought for its independence from England,
Smith Kendon created in 1780 a revolutionary British product designed to re-
lieve intestinal discomfort. It’s name: Altoids. Today we know Altoids as a “cu-
riously strong mint” designed to fight bad breath. The story about how Altoids
came to be the top-selling mint in the United States parallels the evolution of its
brand personality.
Advertising as far back as the 1920s plugged the “curiously strong” mint-fla-
vored lozenges, but Altoids was largely unknown in the United States until Kraft
Food purchased it in 1995 and turned its advertising over to the Leo Burnett agency.
Kraftinheritedaproductthatcameinadistinctive,OldWorld–lookingred-and-
white metal tin emblazoned with the slogan, “The Original Celebrated Curiously
StrongPeppermints.”TheBurnettcreativesadaptedthatphraseandcapturedthe
brandessencewithitscampaign’swryslogan:“TheCuriouslyStrongMint.”
The campaign tone features a type of amusing, rather British self-deprecation,
as if the brand doesn’t take itself seriously. That approach struck a nerve with the
largely cynical, sometimes sarcastic Generation X and Y males who have been the
brand’s most loyal fans.
Burnett’s memorable ads from this classic campaign have featured a muscle
builder with the line “Nice Altoids,” a 1950s teenager with oversized braces and
the headline “Brace Yourself,” and a stern-looking nurse carrying the little red-and-
white Altoids tin with the headline “Now This Won’t Hurt a Bit.” Another ad pro-
claimed, “No Wonder the British Have Stiff Upper Lips.”
As you probably know, the Altoids brand has expanded to include new flavors,
from cinnamon and wintergreen to ginger and sours (in a round tin), as well as gum
and strips. No longer do we think of Altoids for its medicinal qualities.
Change is an inevitable fact of life. Not only did the product come to mean
something different to consumers over time, brand ownership has changed hands
and so have the agencies that manage the marketing communication.
Altoids was a winner for Kraft, so much so that it sold the brand in 2004 to Wm.
Wrigley Jr. Co. for the minty fresh sum of $1.46 billion. The new owner then
awarded the Altoids advertising account to Publicis & Hal Riney. In late 2008, Mars

bought Wrigley, and moved the account to BBDO Chicago. How does a brand
maintain a consistent personality amid changing ownership and agencies?
The success of a brand’s advertising is based on more than the humor of a sin-
gle campaign—especially as ownership of a brand shifts. Altoids ads have an iconic
look. Most feature an intriguing headline that is only a few words long in all capi-
tal letters and a drop shadow outline. Many of the ads are laid out on a plain, mint
green background with a double rule border—a great retro look that reflects the
package design, which reinforces the brand identity.
Although BBDO Chicago has recently dropped the “Curiously Strong” theme,
replacing it with “A Slap to the Cerebellum,” it kept some of the elements from the
previous campaign. Steffan Postaer, one of the Leo Burnett creatives whose ideas re-
sulted in Altoids award-winning work, did not agree entirely with the approach that
BBDO took. But he said this of the new campaign: “You can still see the brand’s DNA
in the language and typography as well as in the tone and manner.” Other efforts in-
clude “Brainstorm,” a branded entertainment collaboration with Fox Mobile Studios.
See for yourself what you think gives a campaign continuity by looking at past
and current advertising at www.altoids.com/ad-gallery.do.Then in the It’s a Wrap
section at the end of the chapter, see how well the advertising has performed over
time for this intense, extreme, and curiously strong mint.

The visual consistency and wry humor in the Altoids cam-
paign go far beyond the ability of words to describe things.
The quirky images communicate ideas about the brand per-
sonality, as well as the feelings and sense of humor of the
brand’s target market. This chapter is about the visuals used
in advertising—how they are designed and what they con-
tribute to the meaning of the ad. First we review some basic
ideas about visual impact, both in print and broadcast, and the
role of the art director. Then we consider print art production
and video production and end with a discussion of the design
of Internet advertising.
WHY IS VISUAL COMMUNICATION
IMPORTANT?
What makes Altoids so visually remarkable? Does the prod-
uct grab your attention? How does the visual build brand per-
sonality? Is it interesting? Do you remember it?
The success of Altoids breath mints is primarily a result
of the consistent graphic presentation of the brand in its mar-
keting communication. The visual consistency is not only ap-
parent in the design of the package and the ads; it also reflects
the history of the brand as a quirky old British lozenge.
The Altoids ads use association to create curiosity, but
also to reflect the meaning of the slogan. “Nice Altoids”
builds on a unique connection between the sound of “del-

In effective advertising, both print and television, it’s
not just the words that need to communicate the message—
the visuals need to communicate, too. The visuals normally
work with the words to present the creative concept. An ex-
ample of a simple story told totally through the visuals is

abruptly as she discovers an ad for the VW Polo with its
“surprisingly ordinary” price.1

example, the smallness of a computer chip or a new minia-

it showed shocking pictures of a naked anorexic woman. The image was shot by
Oliviero Toscani, the former photographer/art director for Benetton, who stirred
up emotions over his photos for that clothing brand by depicting a dying AIDS
victim, death-row inmates, and a nun and priest kissing. Professor Edoardo
Brioschi explains the issues with these images of anorexia in the A Principled
Practicefeature.
In general, print designers have found that a picture in a print ad captures
more than twice as many readers as a headline does. Furthermore, the bigger the
illustration, the more the message grabs consumers’attention. Ads with pictures
also tend to pull more readers into the body copy; initial attention is more likely
to turn to interest with a strong visual. People not only notice ad visuals, they re-
member ads with pictures more than those composed mostly of type. Both the be-
lievability factor and the interest-building impact of a visual story are reasons why
visuals are anchored so well in memory.
Big Ideas that capture attention can be puzzling, shocking, or funny. An ex-
ample is found in the “Welcome” doormat poster used with a twist by Columbia
Sportswear. AVonage campaign for its Web-based phone service uses videos of peo-
ple doing silly things to illustrate its message: “That people do really stupid things.

In another commercial in the series titled “Be more inspired,” a composer agonizes over the
right notes and eventually hits a point of total frustration. As he looks out the window, he sees a
group of birds sitting on a set of five power and telephone wires that are conveniently aligned to
look like a music staff. From the bird’s positions he crafts a tune that becomes the theme for his
composition. PBS used these clever little visual stories to present itself as a creative force that in-
spires people to use their imaginations.
The point is that creative people and art directors in particular design images that tell stories
and create brand impressions. The art—the image or visual elements—in a marketing communi-
cation message can touch emotional buttons. Research by professor Karen Mallia, a regular con-
tributor who wrote an essay for our Part 3 opener, suggests that not only are images moving, they
also are becoming increasingly dramatic and controversial. She has studied the use of religious
imagery in marketing communication and observes that “the change in tenor is best illustrated
with the use of priests in advertising.”
In 1975, Xerox’s “Brother Dominick” spot starred a sweet, earnest monk invoking a “mir-
acle” in duplicating 500 illuminated manuscripts. Fast-forward to 1991, when Benetton
shocked the world with a priest and nun kissing. In 2005, Stella Artois’“Skating Priests”
award-winning spot used surreal, almost sinister humor as you realize that a group of priests
would rather see their fellow priest drown than lose a beer. In 2006, Pirelli tire launched a
worldwide campaign with “The Call,” a 20-minute Web film starring John Malkovich as a
priest called upon to exorcise a car, and Naomi Campbell as the devil.
Mallia concludes that “The Call” with its dramatic tone brings a new level of darkness to ad-
vertising featuring priests. What do you think? Are images like these effective? Should religious
images be avoided or are there times when they are relevant or appropriately dramatic?

Brand Image
We’ve talked in previous chapters about the important role marketing communication plays in the
creation of a brand image. Much of that contribution comes from the visual elements—the sym-
bolic images associated with the brand and the elements that define the brand, such as the trade-
mark and logo. Aclassic brand symbol, for example, is the target graphic used by the Target store.
The association with the brand name is immediately clear and the brand meaning, that Target is
a store where you can go to get what you are looking for, also adds to the identity of the retailer.

CHAPTER 10 • VISUAL COMMUNICATION 295
Alogo,which is the imprint used for immediate identification of a brand or company, is an
interesting design project because it uses typography, illustration, and layout to create a distinc-
tive and memorable image that identifies the brand. Think of the cursive type used for Coca-Cola,
the block letters used for IBM, and the apple with a bite out of it (in both rainbow stripes and
white) for Apple computers. Also check out the logo designs by Michael Dattolico.
Brand icons are characters associated with a brand, such Mr. Peanut, Chester the Cheetah,
Uncle Ben, and Ronald McDonald. If they are effective, they become an enduring symbol of the
brand. Initially the character is designed to reflect the desired brand personality. The Jolly Green
Giant is an imaginary and kind friend who encourages kids to eat their vegetables. Over time,
however, they may need to be updated as the Betty Crocker image has been a number of times.
The trade magazine Adweekcelebrates brand icons and annually inducts winners into its Madi-
son Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame event every fall. Check these out at www.adweek.com.
Package design is another area where brand image is front and center. Sometimes the brand
link is in the shape of the packaging as in the distinctive grandmotherly Mrs. Butterworth syrup
bottles (see an example at www.mrsbutterworthsyrup.com). It may also be in the stylistics as we
have shown with Celestial Seasonings tea boxes (see Chapter 2). The package design also ac-
commodates strategic elements with positioning statements, flags that reference current cam-
paigns, recipes, and pricing announcements. During the Great Recession, a number of
manufacturers found that new packaging with retro designs appealed to consumers. Check out the
Ritz crackers, Oreo cookies, and Corn Flakes brands, among others.
There’s always a tension in advertising between doing something over the top that’s creative
and attention getting and being responsible to the brand image, the strategy, and society. The ac-
ceptability of a wacky image in an ad depends, in part, on its targeting, but it also depends on
judgment and intuition. Our ethics discussions in this book often focus on the appropriateness of
an image and how it reflects on the brand.
For example, an ad for Vaseline Intensive Care Lotion shows a conference room with a
speaker and a group of businesspeople—both men and women—paying careful attention to the
presentation. In the foreground is a happy woman in a business suit with her back to the speaker
and her colleagues. Her legs are up on the table and she’s caressing them. Unfortunately she’s also
a black woman. The headline reads: “Nothing keeps you from handling your business.” So does
Vaseline Intensive Care want us to know that if black women use their product, they become to-
tally clueless in a business meeting? The point is that what appears to the creative team to be a
dynamite visual may, on reflection, send a number of contrary messages.
Environmental Design
Remember we have said that everything communicates and that includes the design of the envi-
ronment in which goods and services are offered for sale. The architectural design and interior
ambiance of a store contribute to its brand personality. If you have been in a Polo store or Polo

WHAT IS ART DIRECTION?
The person most responsible for creating visual impact, as well as the brand identification ele-
ments, is the art director. The art director is in charge of the visual look of the advertisement, both
in print and TV, and how it communicates mood, product qualities, and psychological appeals.
The art director and copywriter team usually work together to come up with the Big Idea, but the
art director is responsible for bringing the visual side of the idea to life.

Illustrations and Photos When art directors use the word
art, they usually mean photographs and illustrations, each
of which serves different purposes in ads. For instance,
photography has an authenticity that makes it powerful.
Most people feel that pictures don’t lie (even though they
can be altered). For credibility, then, photography is a good
medium.
The decision to use a photograph or an illustration is
usually determined by the advertising strategy and its need for
either realism or fanciful images. Generally a photograph is

THE INSIDE STORY
Loving McDonald’s New Look
Amy Niswonger,President, Little Frog Prints
McDonald’s has a new look these
days. Long gone is the bright
red and yellow accented
mansard roof. In its place are
softer, subtler lines and fea-
tures, bringing this fast-food
giant’s image in line with to-
day’s discriminating consumer’s
palette.
With the addition of a new de-
sign and set of healthier food choices,
McDonald’s is updating its image from kiddy classic to a
destination for all ages. In the past few years, the com-
pany has achieved success both in updating its look and
feel and expanding its target market without losing core
customers. How is this possible you might ask? BRAND
EQUITY.
Without hesitation, most people in any country in
the world can recognize a McDonald’s sign instantly
from a great distance. The Golden Arches are an icon,
with enormous brand equity attached. For more than
fifty years the red and yellow color scheme has been a
mainstay among the 30,000(cid:2)worldwide locations, and
not until recently has it strayed from this design.
Due to its overwhelming worldwide presence
through advertisements, endorsements, and other mar-
keting venues, McDonald’s has built such a powerful
brand—and volume amount of brand equity—that it
could dramatically alter its environmental design with-
out taking a hit to its market share. You, as the cus-
tomer, inherently understand that the Big Mac is still the
Big Mac; it’s just served now in a hipper, cooler location.
Brand equity, it’s a powerful tool. Those who have it
love it. Those who don’t strive desperately to achieve it.
When you walk into the new McDonald’s, you will
immediately notice plasma screen TVs, pendant lighting,
comfortable armchairs, and perhaps the boldest new
feature: WiFi Internet access. At first, you might even
mistake the place for a Starbucks or even Panera Bread.
That’s part of the strategy, as McDonald’s is now focus-

also use artistic techniques to intensify meanings and moods, making illustrations ideal for fantasy
(think about comic books and animated films). Photos convey a “seeing is believing” credibility.
Photographs, of course, can also evoke fanciful images. For example, the Maxell “500 Plays” ad
uses visual symbolism to represent a blast of sound.
It is also possible to manipulate a photograph and turn it into art, a technique that brought
recognition to Andy Warhol, among others. This practice has become popular with the advent of
the Internet and the availability of easy-to-find digital images, some of which are copyrighted.

of the few signed by the art director. The original is in the

Recently that technique was used to create a political poster and, at the same time, a legal night-
mare for the artist, Shepard Fairey, as discussed in the A Matter of Principlefeature. Recognized
as one of the most important political images of recent years, the Obama HOPE poster raises
questions about fair use of manipulated images, something everyone has to think about when they
find images online and want to reuse them in marketing communication projects.

Color In addition to photos and illustrations, another important visual element that art directors
manipulate is color, as the Sony ad shown earlier illustrates. Color attracts attention, provides re-
alism, establishes moods, and builds brand identity. Art directors know that print ads with color,
particularly those in newspapers, get more attention than ads without color. Most ads—print,
broadcast, and Internet—are in full color, especially when art directors use photographs.

The layout for the Dunham boot ad shown here speaks in a
quiet voice about the beauty of nature. Even though it’s a boot
ad, it projects an elegance that reflects an appreciation for
nature and a serene outdoor scene (footprints in the snow). The

color effectively in the copy. Note how the layout “shouts,” in

The use of black and white is also an important choice in image design because it lends a dig-
nity and sophistication to the visual, even if it’s a boot as the Dunham ad demonstrates. Ahistori-
cal effect can be created by shooting in black and white or by using a sepia tone, which can make
the images look like old prints that have been weathered by time. When realism is important to
convey in an ad, full-color photographs may be essential. Some products and ad illustrations just
don’t look right in black and white—pizza, flower gardens, and nail polish, for instance.
In print, designers also use spot color,in which a second color in addition to black (a black-
and-white photo or illustration with an accent color) is used to highlight important elements. The
use of spot color is highly attention getting, particularly in newspaper ads. The ACG ad uses red
spot color to accent the product and key words.
Color also can help an ad convey a mood. Warm colors, such as red, yellow, and orange, con-
vey happiness. Pastels are soft and often bring a friendly tone to a print ad. Earth tones are natu-
ral and no-nonsense. Cool colors, such as blue and green, are aloof, calm, serene, reflective, and
intellectual. Yellow and red have the most attention-getting power. Red may symbolize alarm and
danger as well as warmth. Black communicates high drama and can express power and elegance.
Note that these color associations are culturally determined and uses like these are common in
Western countries, but may not be effective in other cultures. White, for example, is the color of
death in many Asian countries.

• Legibility,or how easy it is to perceive the letters.
Generally speaking logos are designed to last for a long time, but sometimes brands change
the design and typography in an attempt to modernize the look or match the mood of the country.
An example comes from the Great Recession period when a number of major brands, such as
Kraft and Walmart, among others moved from their all-cap presentations to lower case. The idea
was to make their logos look softer and less stiff.5
Design Principles
The arrangement of the pieces in a print ad or video shot is governed by basic principles of de-
sign. The design has both functional and aesthetic needs—the functional side makes the visual
message easy to perceive; the aesthetic side makes it attractive and pleasing to the eye.
Principle These design principles guide the eye by creating a visual path that helps the viewer scan the
Design is usually improved elements. For example, dominant elements that are colorful or high in contrast (big versus small,
by simplifying the number light versus dark) catch the viewer’s attention first. How all of the elements come together is a
of elements. Less is more. function of the unity and balance of the design. Direction or movement is the way the elements
are positioned to lead the eye through the arrangement. Simplicity is also a design principle, one
that is in opposition to visual clutter. In general, the fewer the elements, the stronger the impact,
an idea expressed in the phrase “less is more.” Another saying is KISS, which stands for “Keep
It Simple, Stupid.” The Frontier “Caribou” ad is a powerful image because of its use of a simple
horizontal photo across a two-page spread.
Let’s look at how these design principles are used in print layout and in the composition of
a picture or photograph.
Sometimes the most powerful images are the simplest in structure—just a wide horizontal landscape with a swimming
caribou leaving a trail in the water and a plane flying above him. Notice how the antlers point to the Frontier plane with a
caribou on its tail. The whole composition is designed to pull your eye to the right and then up.
CHAPTER 10 • VISUAL COMMUNICATION 303
Print Layout
For print advertising, once art directors have chosen the images and typographic elements, they
manipulate all of the visual elements on paper to produce a layout. Alayoutis a plan that imposes
order and at the same time creates an arrangement that is aesthetically pleasing.
Different layouts can convey entirely different feelings about a product. For example, look
at the two ads for work boots. The ACG “Air Krakatoa” boot ad screams “waterproof!” signaling
the boots’ability to stand up to the most serious weather conditions. In contrast, the ad for the
Dunham boot looks like a work of fine art. The difference between the two campaigns clearly lies
with the visual impact that comes from the layouts as well as the imagery.
Types of Layouts Here are some common types of ad layouts an art director might use:
• Picture WindowAcommon layout format is one with a single, dominant visual that occu-
pies about 60 to 70 percent of the ad’s space. Underneath it is a headline and copy block.
The logo or signature signs off the message at the bottom. The Altoids ads are of this style.
• All ArtThe art fills the frame of the ad and the copy is embedded in the picture. The Frontier
“Caribou” ad is an example.
• Panel or GridThis layout uses a number of visuals of matched or proportional sizes. If the
ad has multiple panels all of the same size, the layout can look like a window pane or comic
strip panel. The Dunham boot ad uses two side-by-side panels.
• Dominant Type or All CopyOccasionally, you will see layouts that emphasize the type
rather than the art, or even an all-copy advertisement in which the headline is treated as type
art, such as the ACG ad. Acopy-dominant ad may have art, but it is either embedded in the
copy or placed in a subordinate position, such as at the bottom of the layout.
• CircusThis layout combines lots of elements—art, type, color—to deliberately create a
busy, jumbled image. This is typical of some discount store ads or ads for local retailers,
such as tire companies.
• NonlinearThis contemporary style of layout can be read starting at any point in the image. In
other words, the direction of viewing is not ordered, as in the “What a Ride” ad for Schwinn.
This style of ad layout works for young people who are more accustomed to nonlinear forms.
This ad for Schwinn bicycles uses a plumbing drain motif to convey the industrial-strength
features of the bike. It is a nonlinear design in that it doesn’t matter where you start reading
and what you read next. The text is carried in callouts that point to different visual elements in
the layout.

Layout Stages The stages in the normal development of a print ad may vary from agency to
agency or from client to client. Figure 10.2shows the six-stage development of an Orly nail polish
ad. This ad went through thumbnail sketches, which are quick, miniature preliminary sketches;
rough layouts,which show where design elements go; semicompsandcomprehensives,which are
drawn to size and used for presentation either in house or to the client; and mechanicals,which as-
semble the elements in their final position for reproduction. The final product that is used for actual
production of the ad is a high-resolution computer file.
Composition
We’ve been talking about layout, which is a term used to describe how the elements in print (head-
line, art, tagline, etc.) are arranged. Compositionrefers to the way the elements in a picture are

arranged (think a still-life painting) or framed through a camera lens (think a landscape photo or
movie scene).Photographers and videographers(people who shoot a scene using a video cam-
era) handle composition in two ways: (1) they may be able to place or arrange the elements in
front of their cameras and (2) they may have to compose the image by manipulating their own
point of view if the elements can’t be moved. In other words, they move around to find the most
aesthetic way to frame an image that isn’t movable, such as a scene or landscape, as well as to
catch different lighting situations, such as bright sun and shade or shadow.
Similar to the way layouts are developed by using sketches, video images are also drawn and
presented as storyboards,which are sketches of the scenes and key shots in a commercial. The art
director imagines the characters and setting as well as how the characters act and move in the scene.
The art director sketches in a few key frames the visual idea for a scene and how it is to be shot
and how one scene links to the scenes that follow. In addition, the storyboard sketches also reflect
the position and movement of the cameras recording the scene, a description of which is spelled
out both in the script and on the storyboard. The “Coffee Ambush” storyboard details the action in
a commercial for McDonald’s new McCafé line of specialty coffees. We’ll explain more about the
commercial in the production section that follows.
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT PRODUCTION?
Art directors need to understand print media requirements and the technical side
of production because these factors affect both the look of the printed piece and its
cost. Marketing communication managers also need to understand some of these
basics in order to critique ideas and evaluate them in terms of cost and feasibility.
Print Media Requirements
Differentmediaputdifferentdemandsonthedesignandproductionofadver-
tising.Newspapersanddirectories,forexample,areprintedathighspeedon
an inexpensive, rough-surfaced, spongy paper called newsprint that quickly
absorbs ink on contact. Newsprint is not a great surface for reproducing fine

as the Oklahoma City ads are specifically designed for high-contrast, black-
and-whiteprinting.Theseworkwellforbothnewspaperanddirectoryads.
Magazines have traditionally led the way in graphic print production be-
cause their glossy paper is a higher grade than newsprint. Excellent photo-
graphic and color reproduction is the big difference between newspapers and
magazines. Magazine advertisements are also able to take advantage of more
creative, attention-getting devices such as pop-up visuals, scent strips, and
computer chips that play melodies when the pages are opened. An Altoids ad
that launched Altoids chewing gum, for example, ran in magazines with a novel
print production technique. It showed a box of Altoids chewing gum on one
page, and a singed logo burnt onto the cartoon on the opposite page.
The key to an effective poster or outdoor board is a dominant visual with
minimal copy. Because billboards must make a quick and lasting impression
from far away, their layout should be compact with a simple visual path. The
Institute for Outdoor Advertising (IOA) recommends these tips for designers:
• GraphicsMake the illustration an eye-stopper.
• SizeImages in billboards are huge—a 25-foot-long pencil or a 43-foot
pointing finger. The product or the brand label can be hundreds of times

306 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
• Figure/GroundMake the relationship between foreground and background as obvious as
possible. Apicture of a soft drink against a jungle background is hard to perceive when
viewed from a moving vehicle at a distance. The background should never compete with the
subject.
• TypographyUse simple, clean, uncluttered type that is easy to read at a distance by an audi-
ence in motion. The industry’s legibility research recommends avoiding all-capital letters,
fanciful ornamental letters, and script and cursive fonts.
• Product IdentificationFocus attention on the product by reproducing the label or package at
a huge size.
• ExtensionsExtend the frame of the billboard to expand the scale and break away from the
limits of the long rectangle.
• ShapeFor visual impact, create the illusion of three-dimensional effects by playing with
horizons, vanishing lines, and dimensional boxes. Inflatables create a better 3-D effect than
most billboards can, even with superior graphics. Made of a heavyweight, stitched nylon, in-
flatables can be freestanding, or they can be added to outdoor boards as an extension.
• MotionAdd motors to boards to make pieces and parts move. Disk-like wheels and glittery
things that flicker in the wind create the appearance of motion, color change, and images
that squeeze, wave, or pour. Use revolving panels, called kinetic boards, for messages that
change.
Print Art Reproduction
In general, there are two types of printed images: line art and halftones. Adrawing or illustration
is called line artbecause the image is solid lines on a white page, as in the Oklahoma City ads.
Photographs, which are referred to as continuous tonesorhalftones,are much more complicated
to reproduce because they have a range of gray tones between the black and white, as shown in
Figure 10.3.
FIGURE 10.3

Screen Values and Tint
Blocks
This shows the range of tint
values that can be produced
by different screens that rep-
resent a percentage of the
color value.
Printers create the illusion of shades of gray in converting photos to halftones by shooting
the original photograph through a fine screen,which converts the image to a pattern of dots that
gives the illusion of shades of gray—dark areas are large dots that fill the screen and light areas
are tiny dots surrounded by white space.The quality of the image depends on how fine the screen
is: Newspapers use a coarse screen, usually 65 lines per inch (called a 65-line screen), whereas
magazines use fine screens, which may be from 120 up to 200 or 300 lines per inch.
Screens are also used to create tint blocks,which can either be shades of gray in black-and-
white printing or shades of color. Ablock of color can be printed solid or it can be screened black
to create a shade. These shades are expressed as a range of percentages, from 100 percent (solid)
down to 10 percent (very faint). Figure 10.4gives examples of screens in color.
Color Reproduction It would be impossible to set up a printing press with a separate ink roller
for every hue and value in a color photo. How, then, are these colors reproduced?
Full-color images are reproduced using four distinctive shades of ink called process colors,
in order to produce four-color printing.These colors are magenta (a shade of pinkish purple),
cyan(a shade of bright blue), yellow, and black. Printing inks are transparent, so when one ink
overlaps another, a third color is created and that’s how the full range of colors is created. For ex-
ample, red and blue create purple, yellow and blue create green, yellow and red create orange.
The black is used for type and, in four-color printing, adds depth to the shadows and dark tones
in an image. The process printers use to reduce the original color image to four halftone negatives
is called color separation.Figure 10.5illustrates the process of color separation.
Digitization If an ad is going to run in a number of publications, there has to be some way to
distribute a reproducible, duplicate of the ad to all of them. The duplicate material for offset
printingis a slick proof of the original mechanical. More recently, digitizationof images has
been used to distribute reproducible images. This is also how computers now handle the color
reproduction process. These digitized images can be transmitted electronically to printers across
a city for local editions of national newspapers, or by satellite for regional editions of magazines
and newspapers such as USA Today. Agencies also use this method for transmitting ad proofs
within the agency network and to clients.
Digitization makes it possible to create some spectacular effects in out-of-home advertising.
Some outdoor boards have become digital screens complete with changing and moving images.
Anew technique in transit advertising comes from Atlanta where the city’s buses are wrapping
their sides with something called “glow skin.” The ads use electroluminescent lighting to make
the ads glow at night and appear to jump off the sides of the buses.7
Binding and Finishing
Art directors can enhance their ads and other printed materials by using a number of special print-
ing effects. For example, USRobotics, a maker of minicomputers, once used a small brochure the
actual size of a Palm Pilot to demonstrate its minicomputer’s size. The shot of the Palm Pilot was
glued to a photo of a hand. As the ad unfolded, it became a complete product brochure that visu-
ally demonstrated the actual size of the minicomputer.
Other mechanical techniques include:
• Die CuttingAsharp-edged stamp, or die, is used to cut out unusual shapes. Acommon die-
cutshape you’re familiar with is the tab on a file folder.

plates showing cyan added first to yellow, then to magenta, then to the combined yellow and magenta plates. These
steps were left out to simplify the presentation.) (E) Black plate. (F) Finished art with all four process colors combined.
• Embossing or DebossingThe application of pressure to create a raised surface (embossing)
or depressed image (debossing) in paper.
• Foil StampingThe process of foil stampinginvolves molding a thin metallic coating (sil-
ver, gold) to the surface of an image.
• Tip-InsAtip-inis a separate, preprinted ad provided by the advertiser that is glued into a
publication as the publication is being assembled or bound. Perfume manufacturers, for ex-
ample, tip in samples that are either scratch-and-sniff or scented strips that release a fra-
grance when pulled apart.
Another example of a nifty production trick is illustrated in the ad for Specialized Bikes us-
ing a “see-through” technique. The graphic elements are separated and printed on the front and

WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT VIDEO PRODUCTION?
Where does an art director start when putting together a video for a commercial, a video news re-
lease, or some other kind of corporate film or video? Lara Mann gives you a look inside the pro-
duction of a television commercial in the A Day in the Lifefeature.

Working within the framework of the creative strategy, art directors create the look of the
TVcommercial. The look of the award-winning “Cat Herders” commercial that the Fallon agency
created for Electronic Data Systems (EDS) was a parody of the American West, much like a John
Ford movie, with horses, craggy-faced cowboys who acted as cat wranglers, and stampeding an-
imals (the cats).

Sophisticated computer graphics systems, such as those used to create the Star Warsspecial
effects, pioneered the making of artistic film and video advertising on computers. Computer
graphic artists brag that they can do anything with an image. They can look at any object from
any angle or even from the inside out. One of the most creative video techniques is called
morphing,in which one object gradually changes into another. Photographs of real objects can
change into art or animation and then return to life. Computer graphics specialists use computer
software to create, multiply, and manipulate video images. (That’s how 50 cats can be made to
look like hundreds in the EDS “Herding Cats” commercial.)
Filming and Editing
Most local retail commercials are simple and inexpensive, and they are typically shot and taped
at the local station. The sales representative for the station may work with the advertiser to write
the script, and the station’s director handles the taping of the commercial.
Creating a national TVcommercial is more complex and requires a number of people with
specialized skills. The ad agency crew usually includes the copywriter, art director, and producer.
The producer oversees the production on behalf of the agency and client and is responsible for
the budget, among other things. The director, who is the person responsible for filming the com-
mercial, is usually someone from outside the agency. This person takes the art director’s story-
board and makes it come to life on film.
The producer and director make up the core of the production team. The commercial’s ef-
fectiveness depends on their shared vision of the final commercial and the director’s ability to
bring it to life as the art director imagined it. In the case of the “Cat Herders” commercial, the di-
rector was chosen by the agency because of his skill at coaxing naturally humorous performances
310
CHAPTER 10 • VISUAL COMMUNICATION 311
from nonprofessional actors. In this commercial he worked with real wranglers on their semi-
scripted testimonials about their work with kitties.
The following list summarizes the responsibilities of broadcast production personnel:
Who Does What in Broadcast Production?
Copywriter Writes the script, whether it contains dialogue, narrative, lyrics,
announcements, descriptions, or no words at all.
Art Director In TV, develops the storyboard and establishes the look of the
commercial, whether realistic, stylized, or fanciful.
Producer(can be Takes charge of the production, handles the bidding and all production

Director Has responsibility for the actual filming or taping, including how long
the scene runs, who does what, how lines are spoken, and how characters
are played; in TVdetermines how the camera is set up and records the
flow of action.
Composer Writes original music and sometimes the lyrics as well.
Arranger Orchestrates music for the various instruments and voices to make it fit a
scene or copy line. The copywriter usually writes the lyrics or at least
gives the arranger some idea of what the words should convey.
Editor Puts everything together toward the end of the filming or taping process;
evaluates how to assemble scenes and which audio elements work best
with the dialogue and footage.
The Process of Producing Videos
As we said earlier there are a number of ways to produce a message for a video, such as a televi-
sion commercial. Let’s look at these production choices.
Typically the film is shot on 35-mm film or videotape and then digitized, after which the editor
transfers the image to videotape for dissemination, a process called film-to-tape transfer. Digital
technology is changing the process. Eventually
films will transfer to hard drives, eliminating the
use of videotape. Art directors work closely with
editors who assemble the shots and cut the film
to create the right pacing and sequence of images
as outlined in the storyboard.
Obviously the Big Idea for the “Cat
Herders” ad created some real production chal-
lenges. In the spot, the Fallon art director de-
cided that the metaphor of herding cats meant
that the cats had to swim across a river, but was
that even possible? Here’s how it was done:
The trainers taught a few cats that weren’t ad-
verse to water to swim by starting them out in
one-quarter inch of water in a child’s swim-
ming pool and then gradually adding water to
the pool until it was deep enough for the cats to
swim. The “river” was actually a small pool
warmed by a portable heater—Art Director
Dean Hanson described it as “a little kitty

Animation The technique of animation traditionally meant drawing images on
film and then recording the images one frame at a time. Cartoon figures, for exam-
ple, were sketched and then resketched for the next frame with a slight change to
indicate a small progression in the movement of an arm or leg a facial expression.
Animation is traditionally shot at 16 drawings per second. Low-budget animation
uses fewer drawings, so the motion looks jerky. The introduction of computers has
accelerated the process and eliminated a lot of the tedious hand work.

Animation effects can also be used to combine animated characters, such as
the little green Geico Gecko, with live-action figures, or even with other animated
characters. The famous Aflac duck was created as a collaboration between Warner
Brothers and the Aflac agency, the Kaplan Thaler Group in New York. More ad-
vanced techniques, similar to those used in movies like Avatar,Up, and the Shrek
series, create lifelike images and movement. Atechnique called “mental ray” was
used in a Levi Strauss ad featuring 600 stampeding buffalo. Mental ray is so good
it not only created lifelike images but even added realistic hair on the animals.8

3-D Filming 3-D is a type of film production that creates the illusion of depth us-

CHAPTER 10 • VISUAL COMMUNICATION 313
wear special glasses. The 3-D technique has been around for many years but only with the big
success of the movie Avatar did it achieve wide popularity. ESPN launched a 3-D Channel in 2010
for the World Cup broadcast and persuaded major advertisers such as Procter & Gamble and Sony
to experiment with 3-D spots on the new channel.
Music and Action Specifying the music is usually done as part of the copywriting; however,
matching the music to the action is an art director or producer’s responsibility. In some cases, as
in high- production song-and-dance numbers, the music is the commercial. Other times, it is used
to get attention, set a mood, and lock the commercial into memory.
For example, a recent JanSport commercial for its Live Wire Euphonic Pack, a backpack
with built-in earphones and volume controls, cries out for a musical demonstration. The unlikely
song picked for the spot, which targets the MTVcrowd, was “Do-Re-Mi” from the 1959 Sound
of Music musical. You might wonder why the creative team at the DDB Seattle agency would
choose such a piece. Actually the rendition is not from the early recording but rather an ethereal,
techno-pop version. The stick-in-the-head lyrics match the action on screen in a contemporary
version of the classic story boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl.9
The TV Production Process
For the bigger national commercials, the steps in the TVproduction process fall into four cate-
gories: message design, preproduction, the shoot, and postproduction. Figure 10.6 shows the
steps in the process.
Preproduction The producer and staff first develop a set of production notes,describing in de-
tail every aspect of the production. These notes are important for finding talent and locations,
building sets, and getting bids and estimates from specialists. In the “Cat Herders” commercial,
finding the talent was critical. Some 50 felines and their trainers were involved in the filming.
Surprisingly, different cats have different skills—some were able to appear to be asleep or mo-
tionless on cue, while others excelled as runners or specialized in water scenes.
Once the bids for production have been approved, the creative team and the producer,
director, and other key players hold a preproduction meeting to outline every step of the
production process and anticipate every problem that may arise. Then the work begins. The
talent agency begins casting the roles, while the production team finds a location and
arranges site use with owners, police, and other officials. If sets are needed, they have to be
built. Finding the props is a test of ingenuity, and the prop person may wind up visiting hard-
ware stores, secondhand stores, and maybe even the local dump. Costumes must be made, lo-
cated, or bought.
The Shoot The director shoots the commercial scene by scene, but not necessarily in the order
set down in the script. Each scene is shot, called a take,and after all the scenes in the storyboard
have been shot they are assembled through editing. If the director films the commercial on video-
tape, it is played back immediately to determine what needs correcting. Film, however, has to be
processed before the director can review it. These processed scenes are called dailies.Rushesare

rough versions of the commercial assembled from cutsof the raw film footage. The director and
the agency creative team, as well as the client representative, view them immediately after the
shoot to make sure everything’s been filmed as planned.
The film crew includes a number of technicians, all of whom report to the director. For both
film and video recording, the camera operators are the key technicians. Other technicians
include—and you’ve probably seen these terms in movie credits—the gaffer, who is the chief

Occasionally the footage will be shot live to catch natural reactions by the participants, such
as the Burger King “Freak Out” commercials described in the opening story for Chapter 1. An-
other example comes from Boston University where an advertising class starred in a McDonald’s
McCafé spot called the “Coffee Ambush,” as described in the A Matter of Practicefeature.
In some rare cases, an entire commercial is shot as one continuous action rather than indi-
vidual shots edited together in postproduction. Probably the most interesting use of this ap-
proach is “Cog,” an award-winning commercial for the Honda Accord that shows the assembly
of pieces of the car piece by piece. It begins with a rolling transmission bearing, and moves
through valves, brake pedals, tires, the hood, and so forth, until the car drives away at the end of
the commercial. It’s tempting to think it was created through computer animation, but the Honda
“Cog” commercial was filmed in real time without any special effects. It took 606 takes for the
whole thing to work—that’s 606 run-throughs of the sequence! One of the most talked-about
spots ever made, the publicity given to the commercial was probably even more valuable than
an advertising buy. The “Cog” commercial won a Grand Clio (a creative award show), as well
as a Gold Lion at the Cannes Advertising Festival. Altogether, it picked up no fewer than
20 awards from various UK and international organizations. The spot can be seen at
www.ebaumsworld.com/flash/play/734.10
Postproduction For film and video, much of the work happens after the shoot in postproduction—
when the commercial begins to emerge from the hands and mind of the editor. The objective of
editing is to assemble the various pieces of film into a sequence that follows the storyboard. Ed-
itors manipulate the audio and video images, creating realistic 3-D images and combining real-
life and computer-generated images. The postproduction process is hugely important in video
because so many digital effects are being added to the raw film after the shoot. In the “Cat
Herders” commercial, Fallon could not film the cats and horses at the same time because of Na-
tional Humane Society regulations. The director had to film the horses, background, and kitties
separately. An editor fused the scenes together during postproduction, editing seamlessly to cre-
ate the illusion of the elaborate cat drive.
Another goal of video editingis to manipulate time, which is a common technique used in
commercial storytelling. Condensing time might show a man leaving work, then a cut of the man
showering, then a cut of the man at a bar. The editor may extend time. Say a train is approaching
a stalled car on the tracks. By cutting to various angles it may seem that the train is taking forever
to reach the car—a suspense tactic. To jumble time, an editor might cut from the present to a flash-
back of a remembered past event or flash forward to an imagined scene in the future. All of these
effects are specified by the art director in the storyboard.
The result of the editor’s initial work is a rough cut,a preliminary edited version of the story
that is created when the editor chooses the best shots and assembles them to create a scene. The
editor then joins the scenes together. After the revision and reediting have been completed,
the editor makes an interlock, which means the audio and film have been assembled together.
The final version with the sound and film mixed together is called an answer print.The answer

What makes Web design different from print designs is the opportunity to use motion, ani-
mation, and interactive navigation. While attention getting, these can also be irritating. Professor
Mallia, who wrote the Part III opener, reminds us that online ads can succeed or fail because of
their design, as well as their copy. She explains, “Visual tactics like rollovers and motion often
annoy more than attract.” She also points out that copy is important in Web design, “Experts find
it’s the copy that often gets the clickthrough—because it offers something the reader wants to read
more about.” So even in the highly visual online world, it’s still important for the art and copy to
work together to attract attention and build interest.
Afascinating website was created for a get-out-the-vote site aimed at young people during
the 2008 election. Check out this website at www.thingsarefine.organd watch how the American
flag falls apart on the opening page followed by the cynical admonition: “Don’t vote. Things are
fine just the way they are.” The site also has great posters that
viewers can download for free, companion public service
commercials, and links to sites that a committed viewer
could use to remind friends to vote and invite them to visit
the site.
Usually the illustrations are created by artists but some-
times for low-budget projects, the illustrations and photos are
obtained from clip-art services, or rather click art, such as that
provided by www.dreamstime.com or www.1StopPictures
.com. Actually, any image can be scanned and manipulated to
create a Web image, which is causing copyright problems for
artists and others who originally created the images, as ex-
plained with the Obama HOPE story earlier in the chapter. Be-
cause of the magic of digitizing, Web pages can combine
elements and design styles from many different media: print,
still photography, film, animation, sound, and games.

and nonlinear editing tools such as Premier, FinalCut, and AfterEffects. It’s such a rapidly changing
design world that it’s difficult to keep track of the most recent innovations in Web design software.
The use of animation effects and streaming video has made websites look more like television and
film. The A Matter of Practicebox explains how this tool is best used.

318 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?
Action and Interaction
Web advertisers are continuing to find ways to bring dramatic action to the small screen to make
the imagery more engaging. For example, Ford used a banner on the Yahoo! home page with the
familiar Ford oval and a bunch of little black birds on a wire. Then three of the birds flew down
to the middle of the page and started pecking at what looked like birdseed, uncovering an image
of the new Explorer. The link read: “Click to uncover the next territory.” Those who did click
probably expected a pop-up image, but instead the page shook, the birds scattered, and a big red
Ford Explorer drove up to the front of the screen, replacing most of the content. It was a surpris-
ing, highly involving, and effective announcement of the vehicle.
Because users can create their own paths through the website, designers have to make sure
that their sites have clear navigation.Users should be able to move through the site easily, find
the information they want, and respond. Navigation problems can really turn off viewers. Eye-
tracking research (studies that use a camera to follow eye movement when looking at a page or
screen) has found that if the navigation is cluttered or unclear, viewers will give up and move on
to some other site.11Ideally, users who visit a site regularly should be able to customize the site
to fit their own interests and navigation patterns.
Online video has also expanded the avenues for action on the small screen on minicomputers,
personal digital assistants, and cell phones. Web video is becoming a new business opportunity for
businesses that want to use videos to display their products. The secret is to plan these videos specif-
ically for a small screen and not just try to use regular television or film images because the screen
is just a fraction of the size of a television and a lot of the detail in an image can get lost.12
If a site is well designed, people may want to interact with the organization sponsoring the
site. For example, Texture/Media, a Boulder, Colorado, Web design firm, created a seven-episode
series over five months that detailed the journey of two men attempting to climb the Meru Sharksfin
summit in India, for client Marmot Mountain Works. Called ClimbMeru.com, it chronicled the
team’s training and trip and hosted contest giveaways that helped gather information about Marmot’s
customers. Texture/Media’s objective with its award-winning websites is to make the consumer
a participant in its brand stories.
Looking Ahead
This is the last chapter in Part 3 on the design of the message. We introduced creative thinking
and the creation of creative briefs; then we discussed copywriting and in this chapter we have pro-
vided you with a brief introduction to art direction and design. Next we turn to Part 4 and the chap-
ters that discuss how messages are delivered—both to and from the target audience and other key
stakeholders.
IT’S A WRAP
Keeping the Altoids
Brand in Mint Condition
As a product’s owners change hands, the new owners are smart to recognize the value of the brand’s her-
itage. The Altoids campaign has a strong, consistent look strengthened by the continuing presence of the
distinctive Altoids tin. Repetition of the look is the key to brand recognition.
The brand is recognizable because it builds on the principle that the more times viewers see an ad with
a consistent format, the more likely they are to remember the product. Another lesson to be learned from the
curiously strong mint: Even though campaigns change, sometimes brands have accrued valuable equity in the
previous work that needs to be maintained and protected.
CHAPTER 10 • VISUAL COMMUNICATION 319
The “Curiously Strong Mints” campaign is one of the most awarded and successful campaigns. The ad-
vertising has garnered multiple awards, including a long string of Kelly Awards for magazine advertising, One
Show creative prizes, and multiple Clios. It won an international effectiveness award when it received the New
York Festival’s Grand Prix award. The Magazine Publishers of America (MPA) bestowed its $100,000 Grand
Prize Kelly Award for outstanding magazine advertising for the Altoids “Burn Through” campaign, which
launched Altoids gum.
The low-cost, edgy campaign has also been a business builder. The brand had virtually no presence in 1995
when Kraft bought it, but by 2000 it dominated the extreme mint market with a 25 percent share. Altoids now
is the number one selling mint in the United States. Although it is difficult to predict how the current generation
of edgy campaigns will fare, the “Brainstorm” branded entertainment effort shows promise. The trailer alone
was viewed more than 100,000 times. Its creators expect to attract 2.5 million views over a six-month period.
What makes Altoids advertising a winner? The memorability and extendability of a curiously strong idea.

PRACTICE: WHERE ARE
MEDIA HEADED?
We talked about creating messages in Part 3. In Part 4, we’re turning to the delivery of the mes-
sage and we’ll look at media planning.
Please note that creative and media planning are parallel and simultaneous processes that are
completely interdependent. Even though we started first with creative, remember that because of
the dynamic media environment, more and more the creative challenge has become to pick the
perfect place to deliver—or encounter—a brand message. In fact, media planning is just as cre-
ative as message planning.
Acrucial point is that the media side of advertising is probably the area that has been chal-
lenged the most in terms of changes in the media landscape, as well as media planning practices.
To underscore the importance of this dynamic media environment, Larry Kelley, partner and me-
dia director at FogartyKleinMonroe, professor at the University of Houston, and author of many
articles and books on media, identifies the four most important trends in the practice of media
planning.
Out of Disruption
Comes Opportunity
Disruption is the key word to describe the media business today. Everywhere you turn, new tech-
nologies, new consumer attitudes, and new methodologies are challenging the conventional wis-
dom of media companies and media planners.
As we move forward into this brave new media world, there will be some funda-
mental changes. The first is that media content companies (online and offline publish-
ers and broadcasters) may not be able to rely on advertising to carry their financial
load. Historically, media companies largely gave away content for distribution but
will that model hold up going forward?

Chapter 12 • Traditional Media
Chapter 13 • Digital Media
Chapter 14 • Media Planning and Buying
The second is the consumer attitudes toward media of a new generation who grew up with
the Internet. The idea of looking at media as a consumer engagement rather than a pure interrup-
tion will challenge media planners and advertisers alike.
The third is digital convergence. All media will likely have some form of digital and inter-
active component, making media selection even more challenging as the lines between various
media blur.
The final change is in the methodology of measurement. Impressions will not be the cur-
rency or the method of choice for media selection. In the future we will move from OTS or “op-
portunity to see” to OFB or “opportunity for behavior” as the critical metric.
For those who are considering media as a career, there is no better time to enter a business
than when it is in a disruptive state. Out of disruption comes opportunity.
The media world has been in a state of incredible change from old traditional mass media to
new interactive social media; from marketers’control of media placement to consumers’control
of media use; and from media targeting to media engagement. In this section, Chapter 14 presents
an introduction to the basics of media strategy and the changes in the media industry. Subsequent
chapters focus on print and broadcast advertising and the Internet. The final chapter in this part
discusses media planning and buying, which is the process by which message strategies are trans-
lated into decisions about the appropriate media to use to best reach specific target audiences.

CHAPTER KEY POINTS
1. How do media work in marketing communication and how is the industry organized?
2. How would you describe the key strategic media concepts?
3. Why and how is the media landscape changing?
Getting Dirty Boys Cleaner
Let’s start with the problem. You have a great product, but you need to reach
an audience that’s reluctant to be persuaded by traditional advertising tech-
niques. How do you convince more young guys who like Axe products to
throw away their bars of soap and start using Axe Shower Gel?
A little background first. Unilever’s personal care brand Axe led the way in get-
ting young men to use scented body sprays. Launched in 2002 in the United States,
Axe deodorant body sprays captured the attention of its audience and soon be-
came the top male deodorant brand in the country. (Did guys even know they
needed scented body sprays before then?)
Expanding its line in men’s grooming products with the shower gel repre-
sented a great opportunity for Unilever, who, along with its ad agency, Bartle Bogle
Hegarty, wanted to grab the attention of the 18- to 34-year-old male audience. It
ran the successful and award-winning “How Dirty Boys Get Clean” campaign,
which you may have seen.
Axe reached its core audience with that campaign by creating an emotional
approach that worked particularly well in the broadcast media. The big idea be-
hind the campaign was that Axe Shower Gel would do more than clean guys phys-
ically; it would help clean their spirits as well. The campaign’s creative work
communicated the “dirty message.” The agency chose media to reach and capti-
vate the audience, amplifying the message in situations where guys might be hav-
ing “dirty thoughts.”
To reach these guys, TV commercials ran on programs like Baywatch, The Real
World,andAqua Teen Hunger Force.Print ads were placed in Maxim, Playboy,and
theSports Illustratedswimsuit issue. Axe also turned up at two of the largest spring
break destinations for college guys where they encountered shower gel messages
everywhere—on bar posters, hotel shower curtains, floor stickers, and bus wraps.
Thewww.theaxeeffect.comwebsite also entertained the guys.
After that campaign had run its course, Axe realized it needed to figure out
how to get more of the target 18- to 34-year-old guys to switch from bars to
shower gel. The “Aha!” moment for the next campaign emerged from research
325

that indicated a correlation between using a loofah and satisfaction with shower
gel’s cleansing power. Without a scrubber, they just weren’t using the shower gel,
and although they said they used loofahs, shower ethnography (a bit tricky, don’t
you imagine?) showed that in reality, they were using fluffy, soft, girlie poufs. Not
the macho image you’d expect.
The key to this campaign was to create a new shower tool soft enough for
theguys’privatepartsandtoughenoughforthemtofeelcleanfortheirwomen.
Axebrilliantlycreatedascrubberthatlookedlikeacartireanddrawingfromcar
culture, gave it a cool, masculine name, the Detailer. Carrying the idea to the
max, the idea developed into a concept that appealed to the target audience:
Guywash.
To demonstrate Guywash to the target audience, BBH used the storytelling
power of cinema and TV. Furthermore, they capitalized on the interactivity of dig-
ital media to let guys try the Detailer. The “Dirty Night Determinator” on the web-
site prescribed a personalized scrub routine for whatever dirty situations the guys
might encounter. Girls could use Facebook to send a “gift” to “dirty” guys. Free
Detailers were sent to anyone who requested one on the brand page. These me-
dia were supported by local-area promotions, in-store Detailer “technicians” who
guided them to the section of the store, and point-of-purchase efforts that turned
shopping into an experience.
You will find more about the marketing effects of Axe’s shower gel campaign
at the end of the chapter in the It’s a Wrapsection.

The lesson that the Axe campaign teaches about media is that smart marketing requires creative
thinking about how to connect with the audience in this complex media environment. What else
has Axe done to reach guys? Read how Axe has made use of branded entertainment in The Ani-
mated Axe Effect in City Hunterslater in this chapter (p. 345). This chapter and the three that fol-
low explain the media side of marketing communication—the story you don’t see, the backstory
about how various ways to deliver a message are selected.
WHAT DO WE MEAN BY MEDIA?
When we talk about media, we are referring to the way messages are delivered to target audi-
ences and, increasingly, back to companies, as well as among audience members themselves.
Media is the go-between1step in the communication model—the way messages are sent and re-
turned by the source and receiver, that is, the company or brand and its customers.
It’shelpfultorememberthatthebasisformostmediahistoricallywasasawaytopresent
the news to the public—and advertising made presenting the news possible because it sup-
ported the costs of producing and distributing print or broadcast media. Of course, some rev-
enue is derived from subscriptions, but in the United States the bulk of the media revenue
comesfromadvertising.
As a result, over the years the word media has been associated with advertising, leading
many to think that media are used only or primarily for advertising. Nothing could be further from
the truth! As Kelley pointed out in the Part 4 opener, advertising may not provide adequate fi-
nancial support for the new media forms and all media are looking for new revenue streams in or-
der to stay in business.
CHAPTER 11 • MEDIA BASICS 327
Media Classifications
The plural noun mediais an umbrella term for all types of print, broadcast, out-
of-home, and Internet communication. The singular noun medium refers to
each specific type (TVis a medium, for example). Amedia vehicleis a spe-
cific TVprogram (60 Minutes,The Simpsons), newspaper (The Washington Post,
Chicago Tribune, El Nuevo Herald), magazine (Woman’s Day, GQ), or radio
station or program (NPR’s All Things Considered, Rush Limbaugh’s talk
show). When a company “buys media,” it is really buying access to the audi-
ences of specific media vehicles. The form that those “buys” take is “space”
(print, outdoor boards, Internet) and “time” (radio and TV).
Media, particularly those used in advertising, are referred to asmass media,
the communication channels through which messages are sent to large, diverse
audiences. Amass medium reaches many people simultaneously and it uses
some technological system or device to reach them (as opposed to personal
communication). The size of the audience is the reason why we refer to radio
and television as broadcasting media—they cast their audio and visual signals
broadly to reach mass audiences.
In contrast, niche media are communication channels through which
messages are sent to niche segments—identifiable groups of people with a dis-
tinct common interest, such as the Hispanic market served by El Nuevo Herald.
Advertising AgeandAdweek,for example, are a subsegment of the more gen-
eral business magazine category. They reach the professional advertising indus-
try niche. The distinction between mass and niche is not based necessarily on
size. The AARP Magazine,for example, which targets baby boomers age 50(cid:2),
is a niche publication and yet it is the world’s largest circulation magazine.2

communication between companies and customers, as well as between and
amongconsumers.
Another term you’ll see in media plans is measured media, which refers to the ability of
media planners to analyze the cost of a media buy relative to the size of the medium’s audience.
Metrics are available for traditional media either from the medium itself or from external audit-
ing agencies, but these figures are much harder to find for new and nontraditional media because
the auditing procedures for these new media have yet to be developed.
The media landscape, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a reporting service that tracks
advertising spending, uses the following categories:3

What Do Media Do?
All marketing communication areas, such as sales promotion, public relations, and direct mar-
keting, use a variety of media to deliver messages to customers. We know from the communica-
tion model presented in Chapter 4that messages move through channels of communication.So
in this sense, media delivermessages. In traditional mass media this is a one-way process from
the source (the advertiser) to the receiver (consumers).
In another sense, media are interactive because they offer opportunities for dialogue and
two-way conversation. The media of marketing communication deliver messages to and from
customers and move messages back and forth through channels. This refines the concept of de-
livery to include receiving and listening, as well as delivering messages. Jugenheimer explains
further, “Now we can respond, ask questions, and even place orders for products or services. This
interactivity can involve more than the Internet; we can gain interactivity on the telephone,
through text messaging on cell phones, and while playing video games.”
Media also offers opportunities for engagement,a media buzzword that refers to the capti-
vating quality of media that the audience finds engrossing, such as the “wire dancers” on the Win-
dows Vista outdoor board. Certainly this can apply to television commercials and cinema
advertising, but it can also be applied to print and Internet ads—anything on which readers con-
centrate. Media experts describe engagement as the closeness of fit between the interests of view-
ers and the relevance of the media content.4 This is how media open the door of the critical
“perception” step in the Facets Model of Effects that we introduced in Chapter 4.
Media are also contact points in that they connecta brand with the audience and ultimately
touch their emotions, as well as engage their minds. The difference between delivery and con-
nection is significant. To deliver means “to take something to a person or place”; to connect
means “to join together.” Delivery is the first step in connecting: it opens the door to touching a
customer in a meaningful way with a brand message. Beyond conventional mass media, IMC

vice, as well as word-of-mouth messages from
people who influence us—all of which may be-
come imbued with emotions leading to strong
personal feelings about a brand.
The Evolution of Media Roles
People in our contemporary society live in a
world of media-delivered news and information,
which traditionally has been supported by ad-
vertising. Over several hundred years, media
have evolved from print, to radio, then televi-
sion, and now the Internet. Newspapers, maga-
zines, and posters provided the visual dimension
of communication; radio added an audio dimen-
sion. Television enabled messages to be heard
and seen with moving images. Today we have
the Internet, which has basically combined tele-
vision and the computer, thus providing the
added dimension of interactivity. We can sum-
marize these changes in technology as eras:
The Print Era Ink and print images repro-
duced as newspapers, magazines, and posters.
The Broadcast Era Visual and audio infor-
mation in the form of radio and television
programs originally transmitted through air
waves but now also distributed by cable and
satellite.

casting, now also distributed through cable
and satellite.
It’s useful to remember that this Digital Era is quite recent. The first website went on line
in 1991; the social networking sites of MySpace and Facebook went on line in 2003 and 2004,
respectively; and Twitter only arrived in 2006. In contrast, the first newspaper ad appeared in
the early 1700s, the first radio station went on the air in 1897, and television became popular in
the United States in the 1940s.

television use news formats—and advertising—that they adopted from print.
Amore serious shift, however, is occurring in the 21st century as computers and the Inter-
net personalize media and bring changes unlike any ever encountered in the history of media.
Internet-based communication can do everything that the traditional media identified as their dis-
tinctive features and offers most of the communication dimensions of its media ancestors.

Traditional mass media advertising is a huge industry with almost $141 billion in advertis-
ing spending.5Media research organization Kantar Media monitors advertising expenditures and
provided the data used in Figure 11.1Although advertising expenditures declined as a result of
the Great Recession of the late 2000s, the greatest growth was in online advertising.
The recession, combined with the explosion of online media, seriously hurt traditional media.
Even though they still dominate in terms of dollars, all traditional media saw decreases in their ad

watch, listen, or read the medium, along with the numbers describing audience size and geo-
graphical coverage. Currently media conglomerates prevail. CBS, for example, created a co-
ordinated ad-selling division, called CBS RIOT, which stands for radio, Internet, outdoor,
and television. The new division was designed to serve primarily local markets and offers
cross-media(also called multichannel) integrated deals. Disney is reorganizing its ad sales
to deliver a similar cross-media ad sales program for its kids’media properties.7
• Media repsorbrokersare people (or companies) who sell space (in print) and time (in
broadcast) for a variety of media. If an agency wants to buy space in all of the major news-
papers in the West, for example, the agency’s buyer could contract with a media rep firm
whose sales rep and brokers handle national sales for all those newspapers. This allows the
media buyer to place the buy with one order.
On the buying side, media planners, buyers, and researchers work primarily for agencies, al-
though they can also be found working for marketers who handle their own media work in house.
Their challenge is to determine the best way to deliver a message, which is called media plan-
ning.The job functions are as follows:
• Media researcherscompile audience measurement data, media costs, and availability data
for the various media options being considered by the planners.
• Media plannersdevelop the strategic decisions outlined in the media plan, such as where to
advertise geographically, when to advertise, and which type of media to use to reach specific
types of audiences.
• Media buyersimplement the media plan by contracting for specific amounts of time or
space. They spend the media budget according to the plan developed by the media planner.
Media buyers are expected to maintain good media supplier relations to facilitate a flow of
information within the fast-changing media marketplace. This means there should be close
working relationships between planners and buyers, as well as media reps, so media plan-
ners can tap this source of media information to better forecast media changes, including
price and patterns of coverage.
• Media buying companies,mentioned briefly in Chapter 1, are independent companies that
specialize in doing media research, planning, and buying. They may be a spin-off from the
media department in an advertising agency, but because they are now independent compa-
nies, they work for a variety of clients. They consolidate media buying to get maximum dis-
counts from the media for the volume of their buys. They then pass on some of this saving to
their clients.
WHAT ARE THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MEDIA STRATEGY?
Media placement is often the largest single cost item in a marketing communication budget,
especially for consumer goods and services. Procter & Gamble, for example, spent more than
$2 billion on measured media in 2009, although for the first time P&G lost its leadership position
as the top U.S. advertiser to Verizon, the telecom giant, which suffered less during the Great Re-
cession than P&G.8Because of the huge amount of money spent on measured media, as well as
nontraditional media, decisions about how the money is to be spent are carefully analyzed and
justified in the media planning process.

The media plan is a subsection within a marcom plan and has its own objectives, strategies, and
tactics. It is also developed in tandem with message planning, the topic of Chapter 8. Figure 11.2

and buying will explain these activities in much more detail.
Key Strategic Media Concepts
Now let’s consider some of the basic components in media strategy and planning. You will need
to be familiar with these terms to understand the review of media forms discussed in this chapter
and the chapters that follow.
Media Mix In most cases a media plan will include more than one medium, and therefore is a
media mix. This media mixis the way various types of media are strategically combined to cre-
ate a certain kind of impact. For example, the campaign that launched the iPod used posters and
magazine ads to create awareness of the new product, followed by television advertising that
showed how to use the product, and billboards that reminded people to look for it in stores.
Because of the breadth of IMC plans, the term multiplatform has become popular to de-

the media experiences of these audience groups:
• Traditionalistsgrew up with newspapers, magazines, and radio. (Note:No television; no
cell phone, computers, or Internet.)
• Boomers,who are in their 50s and 60s, always had those three types of media, but also grew
up with television (but still no cell phones, computers, or Internet).
• Gen Xers,who are now in their 30s and 40s, grew up not only with the media of the preced-
ing generations, but also with tape recorders, Walkman portable radios, video games, VCRs,
and cable TV(still no cell phones, computers, or Internet).
• Gen Yers,who are twenty-somethings, had all the above media, but also grew up with the
computer, as well as satellite TV, the Internet, CDs, and cell phones. (Note:Now, finally, we
have a generation that grew up with computers and cell phones.)
• Millennials,the most recent generation, have grown up with DVDs, TiVo, satellite radio,
iPods, smart phones, Second Life, and more recently they have witnessed the introduction of

CHAPTER 11 • MEDIA BASICS 335
The Basis for the Buy
Decisions about which media to use are based on the profile of the audience that reads, views, lis-
tens, or visits a medium. Media sales reps provide their own data, but research by account plan-
ners also uncovers media use patterns that help make these decisions.
Media planners use a variety of terms to identify and measure audiences. The terms are easy
to confuse, so let’s explain some here before we begin talking about specific characteristics of tra-
ditional media forms in the following chapters.
• ExposureMedia effects all begin with exposure.We know from the discussion in Chapter 4
Principle
that the first step in making an impact is perception—you have to be exposed to a message
Exposure doesn’t equate
before any other effect is possible. Exposure is similar to circulation for television in that it’s to readership or
a rough estimate of the number of households watching a program. However, just because viewership; just because
the television is on doesn’t mean you are paying any attention to the program, let alone the the television is on doesn’t
advertising that surrounds it. Exposure, in other words, doesn’t equate to readership or view- mean anyone is paying
ership. At the most basic level, however, media planners estimate the number of exposures attention to it.
delivered by a media mix.
• ImpressionsAnimpressionis one person’s opportunity to be exposed one time to an ad in a
specific vehicle. Impressions can be added up as a measure of the size of the audience either
for one medium (one insertion in print) or for a combination of vehicles in a media mix.
• CirculationImpressions are different from circulation,because impressions (at least in
print) estimate the readership or rather the opportunity to be exposed (delivery to the house-
hold or a newsstand purchase), rather than just the circulation, which refers to copies sold.
• Gross ImpressionsCirculation doesn’t tell you much about the actual exposure of a print ad.
Amagazine may have a circulation of 1 million, but it might be read on average by 2.5 peo-
ple per issue. This means impressions for that issue would be 2.5 million. If the ad ran in
three consecutive issues, then the estimate of total impressions, called gross impressions,
would be 7.5 million. Similarly, the number of viewers watching a program might be greater
than the number of households reached since there may be more than one viewer watching
and the commercial may be repeated several times in a program. Media planners add up all
those watching and multiply that times the number of placements to estimate gross impres-
sions for TV.

madeitverydifficulttoget20percentofthehouseholdstunedtoanyoneprogram.
• ShareAbetter estimate of impressions might be found in a program’s share of audience,
which refers to the percent of viewers based on the number of sets turned on. The share figure
is always larger than the rating, since the base is smaller. For example, the 2010 Super Bowl
got a rating of 45 (45 percent of all households with television), but its share was 68, which
means 68 percent of all televisions turned on were tuned to the Super Bowl.10
Reach and Frequency The goal of most media plans is to reach as many people in the target au-

Most media plans state both reach and frequency objectives and the media mix is designed
to accomplish both of those goals. You may remember the discussion in Chapter 6of the lamb
market in Iceland. The objective was to reposition lamb to meet the budget concerns of recession-
stressed consumers. Let’s revisit that case with more information about the campaign’s media
plan, which demonstrates how different media are chosen based on consumer use and the ability
of the various media to deliver either reach or frequency.
You may remember that focus groups were used by the H:N Marketing Communication
agency in Reykjavik, Iceland to uncover key consumer insights about lamb—principally that con-
sumers were not buying pricey prime lamb cuts and didn’t know how to cook the more budget-
priced cuts. Other information uncovered in that research was useful in identifying key media
characteristics of the target market. In particular, Ingvi Logason’s research found the following:
• The target group members are the largest consumers of TVin the country.
• Close to 100 percent of the target group has high-speed Internet access and are frequent
users of the Internet at work and at home.
• Iceland most likely has the highest penetration of Facebook users in the world: 94 percent of
the population in the age group of 25- to 40-year-olds (the lamb industry’s target group)
have Facebook accounts.
Logason explained that his agency created “an interactive media plan that would connect
with our target group in settings where they could be engaged in the ads. We would connect with
them on their leisure time where they worked, at home, and in social settings.” The plan used both
television and Facebook. He explains, “The strength of self-dissemination and friend referrals on
Facebook made sure the ad recipes traveled far and wide with recommendation that the person
posting the recipe liked it. Astrong connection was created between viral ads, the Lamb indus-
try’s website, and a Facebook group interested in lamb.”

Intrusiveness Because of the high level of commercial message clutter, companies in the past
have valued all of the help they can get in attracting attention to their messages. Intrusiveness—
the ability of a medium to grab attention by being disruptive or unexpected—is the primary strat-
egy for countering clutter. Kelley in the Part 4 opener pointed out that in the new media world,
engagement will replace interruption. But still, most media use intrusiveness to some degree as a
way to grab the attention of inattentive media consumers.
Media, as well as messages, vary in their degree of intrusiveness. The most intrusive medium

costly than mass media. Admittedly, the word intrusivehas negative connotations. If a message
is too disruptive or irritating, it may not help build a positive brand relationship.

CHAPTER 11 • MEDIA BASICS 337
HOW IS THE MEDIA ENVIRONMENT CHANGING?
As we said at the beginning of this chapter, marketing communication media are in an incredible
state of flux, partially because of the introduction of the computer and the Internet, but also be-
cause of the way people choose to spend their time. Bruce Bendinger, formerly a creative direc-
tor and now publisher of advertising books, analyzes the changing media environment in the
A Matter of Practicefeature.
IMC and Media
We have talked about the connection role of media. Adimension that is particularly important in
IMC is creating, sustaining, and strengthening brand relationshipsover time. Relevant messages
delivered through media that drive positive experiences create value for consumers. This value
adds up over time and emerges as loyalty—the ultimate goal of relationship marketing programs.
Relationship marketing, a concept that originated with public relations, shifts the focus
from the objective of getting a one-time purchase by a target to the maintenance of long-term in-
volvement from all of the firm’s critical stakeholders, whether employees, distributors, channel
members, customers, agencies, investors, government agencies, the media, or community mem-
bers. All stakeholders are seen as communicators who can send either positive or negative mes-
sages about the brand; therefore, it is important to keep in contact with them and keep them
informed about brand programs (see Figure 11.3).
Channels to Contact Points
We have used the term traditional mediain several places in recognition of the fact that the def-
inition of media is changing. We’ve also mentioned contact points.These redefinitions are de-
rived from technological change, from new patterns of consumer media use, and from changing
business practices, particularly the introduction of the IMC perspective in marketing communi-
cation planning.
The thinking about contact points is an IMC-based idea that has redefined and broadened
our understanding of media as a message delivery system. Contact pointsare the various ways

a consumer comes in contact with a brand. This view of media
moves from traditional advertising media (print, broadcast,
outdoor) and the media of various marketing communication
functions (press releases, events, promotional materials, spon-
Deliver Messages Create Interaction sorships) to experiential contacts that in previous advertising-
dominated media plans weren’t generally considered to be
media, such as word of mouth and customer service.
These opportunities are found in a huge variety of vehicles
including everything from the traditional advertising media—

newspapers and magazines, outdoor boards and posters, radio,
and television—but also the Internet, telephone, directories,
packages and labels, signs and building designs and ads painted
on buildings, company trucks and cars, corporate letterhead and

inflatables and airplane banners, and specialty items, such as

mouse pads, to name a few. The list is endless and can only be
identified by studying the lives of customers to spot the points
where they come in contact with a brand—or an opportunity for
FIGURE 11.3 a brand experience or brand conversation.
The Roles of IMC Media In Chapter 7we introduced the seventh principle of IMC:
All contact points deliver brand messages.Another way to ex-
press the contact point idea in terms of our discussion here is: Everything that delivers a message
to a stakeholder about a brand is a contact point.Contact point management, then, becomes the
new way marketing communication planners develop systems of message delivery—and that in-
cludes both to and from all key stakeholders.

Sometimes referred to as experiential marketing,touch-point strategies and programs use
events and store design, among other means, to engage consumers in a personal and involving
way. Some would argue that every brand contact is an experience; however, in experiential mar-
keting the goal is to intensify active involvement beyond the more passive activity of reading,
viewing, and listening to traditional media. The idea is to connect with consumers in ways that
create higher levels of engagement, as well as lasting bonds with a brand.
Packaging It’s not a new function, but packaging is receiving increased attention as a key
contact point. Apackage is both a container and a communication vehicle, and it works in the
store and in the home or office. In particular, it is the last ad a customer sees before making the
decision to buy a brand, as the Pepperidge Farm shelf photo illustrates. Although the focus of
this discussion is primarily on packaging for goods, don’t forget that services also are packaged
in terms of such things as uniforms, other aspects of personal appearance, décor, and delivery
vehicles.
The package is an important communication medium. Even if you can’t afford a big adver-
tising budget, you’ve got a chance to grab shopper attention if your product has a compelling im-
age on the shelf.” In an attempt to win over undecided consumers at the point of purchase, many
manufacturers create innovative, eye-catching packages. Although the industry has never devel-
oped a standard for measuring impressions from a shelf, advertisers are aware of the billboarding
effect of a massed set of packages, a practice that Pepperidge Farm uses to good effect. Once on
the shelf at home or in the office, it is a constant brand reminder.
When the package works in unison with other marketing communication, it not only catches
attention and presents a familiar brand image, it can communicate critical information and tie
CHAPTER 11 • MEDIA BASICS 339
back to a current campaign. The package serves as a critical reminder of the product’s im-
portant benefits at the moment the consumer is choosing among several competing brands.
Sometimes, the package itself is the focus of the advertising, particularly if there is a
new size or innovation, such as Coca-Cola’s introduction of a new bottle made from plant
materials that is more compostable than plastic.12In sum, packaging is a constant commu-
nicator, an effective device for carrying advertising messages, and a strong brand reminder.
Packages can also deliver customer benefits. For example, recipes for Quaker Oats’
famous Oatmeal Cookies, Nestlé’s Tollhouse Cookies, Chex Party Mix, and Campbell’s
Green Bean Bake all started as promotional recipes on the product’s packaging and turned
into long-time favorites in homemakers’recipe boxes. There is even a website for these
classic recipes (www.backofthebox.com) that features more than 1,500 recipes found on
packaging.

Word of Mouth Buzz is important because it means people are talking about a brand. This
buzz may be the most important factor in consumer decision making because the recom-
mendations of others are highly persuasive—more so than any advertisement. Given the en-
gaging work of its agency, Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky, Burger King is often lauded as the
“king of buzz.” Tia Lang, interactive director at BK, says “Social media is very important
in today’s environment and we think generating buzz is a positive result in and of itself.”

can reach influential or early adopters whose opinions are valued by others. One idea is that buzz
is best generated by disrupting common patterns of thinking, or schemas. In other words, we talk
about things that surprise and don’t fit into our standard mental models.17
Viral Communication An online version of buzz, viral communication describes the way a
message spreads on the Internet. Viral marketing strategies are designed to create a ground-
swell of demand for a brand. However, the spread of messages depend totally on consumers cre-
ating buzz through their own e-mails and mentions on blogs, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.
Brands can instigate the viral process, but not control it. An example comes from a McDonald’s
Filet-O-Fish special promotion that runs every year during Lent. In a parody of the “Big Mouth
Billy Bass” gag gift, a fish hanging mounted on a plaque in a garage sings, “Give me back that
Filet-O-Fish.” The outlandish video has been viewed on YouTube more than a million times and
has spawned ads and even a ring tone.18

Aworry for planners is that viral messages can also spread negative stories or even be used
to organize a boycott against a brand. As Simon Clift, Unilever’s chief marketing officer, ex-
plains, “No matter how big your advertising spending, small groups of consumers on a tiny
budget might hijack the conversation.”19
Customer Service It’s not a new business func-
tion, but it is new to marketing communication
planners who, in the past, were seldom involved
in planning or monitoring this critical connection
with customers. Customer service represents a
company’s attitude and behavior during interac-
tions with customers. These interactions send
some of the most impactful brand messages that
customers receive. If the interactive experience is
positive, it will strengthen the customer relation-
ship; if it is negative, it can weaken or even de-
stroy a customer’s brand relationship.
The importance of customer service as a con-
tact point that delivers positive (or negative) brand
experiences is reflected in a campaign by online re-
tailer Zappos.com that demonstrates to cus-
tomers how its customer service representatives
make it easy to order or return merchandise. Called

tainment has become as much of a driving force for modern digital media as news was for tra-
ditional media.
Two major changes in media use patterns are media-driven lives and media multitasking. In
their youthful days the traditionalists’and baby boomers’lives were dominated by work and fam-
ily activities. In contrast, more recent generations spend more time with media of all kinds, and
those channels are more intertwined with their family, work, and leisure time. People not only
spend more time with media, they use more than one medium at a time.20
Traditionally most media involved a solitary experience—reading a paper or listening to ra-
dio, for example, but another transformation is the creation of truly social media. First there were
blogs, then MySpace and Facebook, then Twitter—all of which made personal space public. The im-
mediacy and intimacy of a phone conversation has exploded into millions of interactions via Twitter.
(Think about this: if you can send 1 million tweets, are you broadcasting? You probably don’t know
the 1 million recipients—so has Twitter become a form of mass media?)
It used to be that global media were limited in number and generally media were limited by
national boundaries—most media, particularly newspapers, radio, and television, were primarily
local. The Internet changed all that. You can be on an island in Indonesia and still text about your
experiences to friends back home. Most travelers from Western countries are connected to their me-
dia wherever they are in the world. Some coun-
tries, such as China, try to control the Internet
access of their citizens, but most people are able
to travel the world of the Web logging into sites
without consideration of where they are or where
the site comes from.

Aform of guerilla marketing you’re probably familiar with are the sign holders hired by lo-

Product Placement For years we have been exposed to product placement,in which a brand
appears in a television program, movie, or even in print as a prop. With product placement, a com-
pany pays to have verbal or visual brand exposure in a movie or television program. George
Clooney’s movie Up in the Air,for example, prominently features American Airlines and Hilton
Hotels as “integrated marketers.” Media analysts estimate that Apple Computer and Pontiac each
received over $25,000 in media value through placements in the television series 24.21

Television programs have also gotten into the product placement game. Both the Coca-Cola
brand and the Ford Motor brand have been embedded into the successful talent show American
Idol,and the Target bulls-eye is frequently seen as part of the action sets and props on Survivor.
The greatest advantage of product placement is that it demonstrates product use in a natural
setting (“natural” depending on the movie) by people who are celebrities. It’s unexpected and, if
it’s an obvious use, may catch the audience when their resistance to advertising messages may be
dialed down. It’s also good for engaging the affections of other stakeholders, such as employees
and dealers, particularly if the placement is supported with its own campaign.
The biggest problem is that the placement may not be noticed. There is so much going on in most
movies that unless you can overtly call attention to the product, its appearance may not register. Amore
serious problem occurs when there is not a match between the product and the movie or its audience.
Another concern is that advertisers have no idea whether the movie will be a success or failure as they
negotiate a contract for the placement. If the movie is a dud, what does that do to the brand’s image?
Another problem is an ethical one—when is a product placement inappropriate? For exam-
ple, some pharmaceutical marketers have found that a product “plug” can be a way around the
FDA’s requirements on the disclosure of side effects. Public policy critics warn that it’s not just
drugs; the problem exists for weapons, alcohol, tobacco, and gambling, among other product
categories that raise social concerns. Product placement has been called “stealth advertising,”
by the Writers Guild of America who argued that “millions of viewers are sometimes being sold
products without their knowledge . . . and sold in violation of governmental regulations.”22
What do you think? Should there be more controls over product placement?
Video Games Marketers and media planners have been frustrated trying to reach young people
with traditional ads on mainstream media. That has led to an increased focus on Internet advertis-
ing, but also on unusual media that are clearly the province of young people, such as video games.
Now a global multibillion-dollar industry, the video game business is developing as a major new
medium for advertisers to target 12- to 34-year-old males, although girls are getting into the act as
well, and Wii is bringing in an older adult audience of both men and women with its sports and ex-
ercise programs. The iPad made the video game market mobile. Video games offer opportunities
for advertising, but also for product placement.

that way Smash Hitsis like the video game version of a
“Greatest Hits” album. Diego Contreras, interactive art
director at Crispin Porter (cid:2) Bogusky explained the
thinking behind an online promotion for Smash Hits:
“We divided the songs in nine categories such as Best
Scream, Best Shred (guitar solo), and Song of the Year.
On the site, each category had a fun video with humor-
ous voice-overs calling out the nominees, in the same
fashion as the Oscars or the MTV Music Awards.”

this effort is as it puts the story behind Altoids on the small screen.
Similar to television programs with recurring episodes in a developing story, webisodes
have created a new form of Web advertising. Fallon Worldwide created the original experiment
in this new format for its client BMW. Known as the “BMWfilms,” the series consisted of high-
action mini-movies by well-known action movie directors (John Woo, Guy Ritchie, and Ang
Lee), all of which featured various BMWmodels in starring roles. This practice has become par-
ticularly popular in China where increasingly marketers are building plots around their products,
particularly lifestyle products that expose viewers to visions of how the newly rich should enjoy
their healthy incomes.23
An example of branded entertainment is described in The Inside Story feature, which ex-
plains how an animated program was created for the male-grooming brand Axe. It took almost
three years and more than 100 people in four different continents to produce the program titled
City Hunters. The creative team was composed of award-winning screenwriters, novelists, and
creatives under the direction of the Catmandu Branded Entertainment company. The integrated
launch campaign featured a special edition package with City Hunterscharacters. The 360-degree
promotional effort for the show included:

andavideogameplayer.
The most versatile of all media, the smart cell phones provide music, movies, photography,
video games, personal conversation, shopping, and access to all the news and information avail-
able on the Internet. The leaders in the development of these new tools have been Scandinavian
countries and Japan; the United States is just catching up with these high-tech countries that have
been using smart phones for years.
Messages on mobile phones usually look like small banners tucked into the corner of a Web
page or text messages that can resemble spam. Mobile marketing agency AdMob and Google
have designed more visual ads, some even showing maps with a retailer’s location or apps that
allow users to watch a commercial between levels in a video game.24
Cell phones also launched new product lines such as graphic faceplates and specialty ring
tones. Female teenagers were leaders in exploring text messaging (TM) on their cell phones
and teaching others (their parents, older siblings, teachers). Instant messaging (IM),in which
two people chat via their computers, has been used more for business, as has the Bluetooth
technology, which keeps businesspeople in touch with their companies and clients wherever
they are.
In addition to becoming essential communication, information, and entertainment tools in
most people lives, cell phones also open up new avenues for commercial communication.
Mobile marketingis the strategy based on reaching people on the run via their cell phones. It
refers to the use of wireless communication (WiFi) and GPS locational devices to reach people
on the move with geotargeting capabilities. The Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) defines
mobile marketingas the use of wireless media, primarily cellular phones and personal digital as-
sistants (PDAs), such as RIM’s BlackBerry. But mobile marketing is more than just cell phones
and PDAs; it also includes laptop computers and even portable game consoles as vehicles that
can deliver content and encourage direct response within a cross-media communication pro-
gram. Mobile marketing includes instant messaging, video messages and downloads, and ban-
ner ads on these mobile devices. The MMA reported that U.S. advertising expenditures on
mobile marketing increased by more than 20 percent in 2009 and predicted similar increases dur-
ing the 2010s.25
It is possible, for example, to send text messages or voice mail with news about special sales
to people’s cell phones or PDAs that use wireless technology (such as Bluetooth) when these cus-
tomers are in the vicinity of a favorite store or restaurant. If a cell phone user, for example, regis-
ters with a favorite store, then that store can contact the user when he or she is in the neighborhood.
These calls can announce special deals or invite the customer in for a taste test or some other type
of promotion. If the call is not an opt-in message, then it can be intrusive and irritating. The phones
can also be used to contact a store. Pizza Hut and Papa
John’s customers, for example, can use their smart
phones to place orders and, by dragging and dropping
toppings onto virtual pizzas, they can create their own
personal pizza. Domino’s features a simulated photo-
graphic version on its website that can be customized.26
Although IM/TM advertising—primarily in the
form of product notices—is big in Japan, it’s still seen as
an invasion of privacy in the United States. Even with the
huge increase in texting, particularly by 18- to 24-year-
olds (95 percent use texting), it’s a puzzle for marketers
because, as Advertising Agereported, “it is very much a
permission-based channel of communication.”27

CHAPTER 11 • MEDIA BASICS 347
Branded Apps Anapp, short for application,is a piece of software than runs on your computer,
cell phone, or social networking site. Thousands of apps are available that serve as links to other
sites or provide some kind of immediate service, such as weather reports or current news. The
number of iPhone apps now exceeds 100,000. The Google Droid operating system was launched
with a Google Map app as a point of competitive advantage.
Marketers are particularly interested in branded apps, which are generally free but
prominently linked to a brand. For example, REI has an app for snow reports. Zippo has a free
virtual lighter for iPhones that looks and acts like a real lighter. You can jerk the phone to open
or close the Zippo and a little button let’s you light it with a simple flick. The point is strictly
brand identification but there is a bit of utility in using a cell phone for that Zippo moment in
concerts when people hold up their lights—in this case, images of a Zippo on their iPhones.
It’s almost a toy but the engagement with the brand has made the Zippo app one of the more
popular ones.28
Other apps offer more utility. Banks, for example, let you check balances, pay bills, make
transfers, and locate branches—and with the GPS navigation capability in some smart phones,
the app can even plot a route. AStarbucks app features a Starbucks location finder. Kraft’s app,
iFood Assistant, which is one of the few that comes with a price tag, provides recipes, cooking
instruction videos, meal shopping lists, and store locators. CNN also offers a functional app that
provides a 24-hour news feed with video for a one-time fee of $1.99.
The launch of Apple’s App Store propelled the development of thousands of branded apps.
The concept is showcased in some of Apple and AT&T’s full-page ads in publications that show
the iPhone with a suite of apps accompanied by callouts that explain what the apps do. You can
check out the App Store at www.apple.com/iphone/apps-for-iphone/phone.
Other New Media We have said before that media needs creative ideas just as much as the
creativesidedoes.Thereisacontinualsearchforanovelwaytogetconsumersengagedwith

As we mentioned in the discussion of mobile marketing, streaming videos from profes-
sional media companies—including television programs and movies—are joining homemade
creations like those from YouTube and appear not only on personal computers, but also on smart
phones, such as iPhones. Nintendo is now adding Netflix as streaming video to its Wii video game
console.29These creations can be as engaging as anything on conventional television. For exam-
ple, CBS has created a cell phone app video game of America’s Next Top Modelwhere viewers
can play with animated versions of the show, pick dresses, and experiment with the stars’makeup.
(See it at http://topmodel.pressokentertainment.com.) Skype software has continued to innovate

Looking Ahead
We started out by noting that the media environment is going through lots of shifts and we ended
by detailing some of those changes. With this brief introduction to the basics of marketing com-
munication media, as well as the new and nontraditional forms of media, we turn now in the next
chapter to a review of traditional media—print, outdoor, and broadcast—and the characteristics
that make them different from other media forms.
CHAPTER 11 • MEDIA BASICS 349
IT’S A WRAP
Axe Cleans Up
As you read throughout this chapter, reaching consumers in a complex and rapidly changing media envi-
ronment challenges advertisers to think creatively. Those who will be successful in advertising break
through the clutter and deliver messages that are relevant to the consumer. The Axe campaigns you read
about in the case opener, “How Dirty Boys Get Clean” and “Axe Detailer: The Manly Shower Tool,” demon-
strate how marketing contributed to making Axe the top male shower brand in the United States.
After the Detailer was introduced, sales exceeded expectations. For example, the number of units sold
per Walmart store per week more than doubled that of other shower gel products. The campaign was so suc-
cessful, many stores had trouble keeping Axe Shower Gel on the shelves. Share of market increased as well,
peaking with the communication activity. Tracking studies indicated that the Detailer campaign achieved the
goals of communicating the correct branding and teaching something about the product.
Demonstrating another way to clean up, Axe has won many advertising awards, including an Effie and
two Bronze Lions from the Cannes International Advertising Festival.
If you read “The Animated Axe Effect in City Hunters” in this chapter you realized that Axe is a global
brand. You read about Axe’s efforts to create branded entertainment. Other award-winning work is occurring
across the globe. Mindshare won “best localization” for its multinational work at the Valencia Festival of Me-
dia in Spain for a campaign that centered around the concept that “men should be as irresistible as choco-
late” to women. To give you an idea about how this worked, French girls gave guys “nibbles and licks” on a
social networking site, while in Belgium, luxury chocolate love tokens were distributed. Portuguese guys were
coaxed into buying chocolate, seducing girls, and possibly winning a visit to the Chocolate Pleasure Mansion.
These sparkling efforts show the extent to which creative ideas can be applied to a variety of media and con-
texts, all to achieve the same effect—to sell the product.

4. How do marketers use movies and other video formats for marketing communication?
Quacking through Clutter
Geico. Allstate. Nationwide. Met Life. Many insurance companies are begging for
your attention. You’ve probably never heard of the American Family Life Assurance
Co., nor are you likely to be familiar with its primary service: supplemental work-
place medical insurance, a type of insurance that is used by people to help cover
the many loopholes and deductibles in their primary insurance coverage.
Then again, if you are like 94 percent of U.S. consumers, maybe you have
heard of the company. In its advertising, it calls itself “Aflac.”
Introduced in 2000, the long-running Aflac campaign featuring the quacking
duckwasthebrainchildoftheNewYorkagencythatbearsitsowner’sname,Linda
KaplanThaler.Almostalladsfeatureawhiteduckdesperatelyscreaming“Aflac!”
at unsuspecting people who presumably need supplemental insurance. Alas, the
duck’s audience never quite seems to hear him. Most of the ads contain a fair
amount of slapstick, usually at the expense of the duck, whose exasperated-
sounding voice originates with former SaturdayNightLivecast member Gilbert
Gottfried.
The campaign has been enormously successful. Since its inception, brand
name awareness increased from 12 percent to more than 90 percent. Ad Agehas
named a commercial featuring the duck as one of the most recalled ads in the
country. Forbes named Aflac one of the Top 25 Power Brands in the United States
in 2004. By 2004, sales of the multibillion-dollar corporation had increased by
20 percent.
What a bargain. By one account, Aflac spent a poultry, scratch that, paltry sum
of $45 million on television advertising annually. Compare that to McDonald’s
$680 million annual ad budget, which supports Ronald McDonald, or Energizer,
whose company has plunked down about $1 billion on its Bunny advertising dur-
ing the past 35 years. So, the duck has been quite a bargain in terms of getting
attention.
The spokesfowl is not without his problems, however. It seems that the duck
gets all the attention. Everyone knows it as an advertising icon, but customers
don’t know what it sells. The next generation of ducky advertising is addressing
that very problem.
353
354 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
Aflac has switched agencies to Zimmerman in Tallahassee, Florida, part of the
Omnicom Group, who is building on the brand’s identity by using the duck to trans-
form brand identification into brand education. The agency is using both new and
traditional media. If you looked, you would have seen the duck on billboards in
Times Square along with this odd Web address: youdontknowquack.com.The mul-
timedia campaign featured newspaper ads and television commercials during the
Winter Olympics to direct people to another Web address for more information. It
also featured full-page ads in newspapers, such as the Wall Street Journal.
The ad was a teaser ad in that the sponsor was unidentified (unless the duck
gave it away). The ad relied on reader curiosity to get people to visit the Aflac site,
which opened with a quiz that tested common knowledge. On television the an-
nouncer says, “If all you know about us is . . .” when he’s interrupted by the duck
quacking, “Aflac!” The announcer then continues, “. . . then you don’t know quack.
To find out all the ways Aflac’s got you covered, visit knowquack.com.”
The efforts to build the brand continue with variety of 45 elements in addition
to the traditional print, outdoor, and TV already mentioned, including a Facebook
and YouTube presence, trivia questions on TV, a line of duck clothing, a Quack en-
ergy drink, video clips called “duckumentaries,” commercials on NBC’s Winter
Olympics, and a NASCAR race car showing the duck’s image and using the “You
Don’t Know Quack” theme.
Turn to the It’s a Wrapsection at the end of the chapter to learn more about
how this effective campaign got consumers to know more about Aflac than quack.

The Aflac campaign has been successful because of its use of television to dramatize a funny sit-
uation where the Aflac duck tries to get the attention of people needing supplemental insurance.
More recently it has used print and outdoor advertising with strong duck graphics to announce a
new strategy that proclaims “You Don’t Know Quack” about what Aflac offers. These teaser ads
are designed to drive traffic to the website where you can find everything you need to know about
supplemental insurance.
In this chapter, we explore the uses, structure, audiences, and advantages and disadvantages
of traditional media such as print, which includes newspapers and magazines; out-of-home me-
dia; and finally broadcast media, which includes radio and television. We also review film and
video formats that are used in campaigns.
WHAT ARE THE KEY PRINT MEDIA CHARACTERISTICS?
Print media vehicles include newspapers, magazines, brochures, and other printed surfaces, such
as posters and outdoor boards. Although it is true that magazines and newspapers, especially, have
expanded their message delivery online, billions of dollars are still spent on traditional print me-
dia. That is what this section is all about.

CHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 355
Consumers also find that reading a print publication is more flexible than watching or lis-
tening to broadcast because they can stop and reread, read sections out of order, or move through
the publication at their own speed and on their own time. They can also save it and reread. Be-
cause the print message format is less fleeting than broadcast and more concrete, people tend to
spend more time with print and absorb its messages more carefully. Print can be highly engaging
when targeted toward audiences that have a special interest in the publication’s content, such as
women and women’s magazines.
Print has the ability to engage more of the senses than other media because it can be both
tactile (different types of paper and other surfaces) and aural (smell). Magazines, for example,
have long offered scratch ’n’sniff ads, particularly for perfume, and that’s becoming more com-
mon in newspapers. Newspapers have announced the availability of aromatic ads, so the smell of
coffee may waft from your morning newspaper sometime soon.

they serve. The New York Timesserves the New York region, but it also has a national circulation,
particularly for its Sunday edition. Local papers are struggling to survive but their readers still
value them for their coverage of local politics, education, crime, sports stories, local events,
church news, and local people features.
Retailers like to place ads and press releases in daily
newspapers because their lead time (the advance time
needed to produce a publication) is short—just a few days.
Food stores, for example, can change offers and pricing
quickly depending on product availability. Also, because
most newspapers are local, retailers aren’t paying to reach
people who live outside their shopping area.
Newspapers can be categorized according to their pub-
lication frequency, such as dailies, weeklies, and Sunday edi-
tions. In addition, business and organizational newspapers
are available to trade and membership groups.

356 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
Newspapers are third to television in terms of advertising revenue. The two largest U.S.
newspapers,USA Todayand the Wall Street Journal,continue to be leaders, although circulation
has eroded for them, as well as for many local newspapers. To balance the budget, Dow Jones,
the owner of the Wall Street Journal,has sold six newspapers, cut WSJstaff and costs, including
reducing the page size, and increased its emphasis on its other media and Internet publishing op-
portunities to reduce its dependence on print ad revenue. The WSJ, however, is one of few news-
papers to gain circulation during the recession.1 USA Today reported a 17 percent drop in
circulation in 2009, which threatens its number one position. The biggest problem it faces is a
travel slump, which has hurt USA Today’shotel circulation.
Other sources of revenue besides advertising include reader subscriptions and single-copy
sales at newsstands. Circulation is the primary way newspapers’reach is measured and compared
with the reach of other media. USA Today’scirculation is different from other daily newspapers
in that it is targeted to travelers and its primary sales consist of single-copy sales and bulk sales
to hotels, rather than subscriptions. Subscriptions, however, have been a problem as readers have
migrated to online versions and dropped their print subscriptions.
Newspapers are chasing revenue in a number of new areas, in addition to online sales. The
New York Times, for example, sells a variety of classy items in its New York Timesstore. The mer-
chandise is similar to that found in museum stores, such as art glass, music boxes, and old ship
models. It has also started the New York TimesKnowledge Network and offers a variety of online
courses for personal and career development.
Amore serious change was announced by the Dallas Morning News(DMN). The changes
revolved around a reorganization that would see section editors (sports, entertainment, real estate,
automotive, travel, among others) reporting to sales mangers. Die-hard journalists were horrified
at the thought of the editorial side being merged with advertising because of implications for news
objectivity and independence. The DMNexecutives, however saw it as a way to grow the busi-
ness by better meeting advertisers’business development needs.2
Newspaper Ad Sales Mirroring the circulation patterns, newspaper advertising can be de-
scribed as national or local (retail), as well as classified and online. Newspaper advertising is sold
based on the size of the ad space and the newspaper’s circulation. The charges are published on
arate card,which is a list of the costs for advertising space and the discounts given to local ad-
vertisers and advertisers who make volume buys. National advertisers pay a higher rate.
Most advertising sales are handled locally by the sales staff of the newspaper; however,
newspaper representatives (called “reps”) sell space for many different newspapers. This saves
an advertiser or its agency from the need to make a multitude of buys to run a national or regional
campaign in newspapers. The system is known as one-order, one-bill.The Newspaper National
Network (www.nnnlp.com) is a partnership of newspaper companies that place ads in some
9,000newspapers. Google has also gotten into this business, allowing advertisers to buy ads in
daily newspapers through its website.
Until the 1980s national advertisers shied away from using newspapers, not only because of
the buying problem, but also because each paper had its own peculiar size guidelines for ads,
making it difficult to prepare one ad that would fit every newspaper. In the early 1980s, the Amer-
ican Newspaper Publishers Association and the Newspaper Advertising Bureau introduced the
standard advertising unit (SAU)system to solve this problem. The latest version of the SAU
makes it possible for newspapers to offer advertisers a great deal of choice within a standard for-
mat. An advertiser can select one of the 56 standard ad sizes and be assured that its ad will work
in every newspaper in the country.
Another alternative that allows national advertisers to pay the local rate is cooperative (co-
op) advertising with a local retailer. Co-op advertisingis an arrangement between the advertiser
and the retailer whereby the retailer buys the ad and the manufacturer pays half—or a portion de-
pending on the amount of space the manufacturer’s brand occupies.
Types of Newspaper Advertising Three types of advertising are found within the local newspa-
per: retail/display, classified, and supplements—and most of these are found online, as well as in
the print form of the newspaper.
• DisplayThe dominant form of newspaper advertising is display advertising.Display ads,
such as the Aflac ads, can be any size and can be placed anywhere in the newspaper except

their interest to readers, such as “Help Wanted” and “Real Estate for Sale.” Classified ads
have represented approximately 40 percent of total newspaper advertising revenue in the
past, but local online services, such as Craigslist, have almost destroyed newspaper classi-
fied advertising. That has created a huge bottom-line problem for local newspapers.
• SupplementsNewspapersupplementsare magazine-style publications inserted into a news-
paper, especially in the Sunday edition, that are either syndicated nationally or prepared
locally. Syndicated supplements, such as ParadeandUSA Weekend,are provided by an inde-
pendent publisher that sells its publications to newspapers throughout the country. Afree-
standing insert (FSI)is the set of advertisements, such as the grocery ads, that are inserted
into the newspaper. These preprinted advertisements range in size from a single page to more
than 30 pages and may be in black and white or full color. This material is often printed else-
where and then delivered to the newspaper. Newspapers charge the advertiser a fee for insert-
ing a supplement. FSI advertising is growing in popularity with retail advertisers for three
reasons: (1) it allows greater control over the reproduction quality of the advertisement, (2) it
commands more attention than just another ad in the paper, and (3) advertisers can place FSIs
in certain newspapers that are delivered to certain neighborhoods, or even certain people.

audience. Agencies obtain objective measures of newspaper circulation and readership by sub-
scribing to one or both of the following auditing companies:
• The Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC)The ABC is an independent auditing group that rep-
resents advertisers, agencies, and publishers. This group verifies statements about newspaper
circulationand provides a detailed analysis of the newspaper by state, town, and county. ABC
members include only paid-circulation newspapers and magazines.
• Simmons-ScarboroughSimmons-Scarborough Syndicated Research Associates provides a
syndicated study that annually measures readershipprofiles in approximately 70 of the na-
tion’s largest cities. The study covers readership of a single issue and the estimated undupli-
cated readers for a series of issues.
Magazine Basics
The more than 6,000 magazines published in the United States appeal to every possible interest.
Most magazines aim at niche markets with a focus on a particular hobby, sport, age group, busi-
ness category, and profession. These special-interest publications generally have small circula-
tions but there are exceptions. The number-one magazine in terms of circulation is AARP,The
Magazine,which is sent free to anyone over age 50.
The Magazine Publishers Association (MPA) estimates that more than 90 percent of all

ests. Readers also spend more time reading a magazine than they do reading a newspaper, so there
is a better opportunity to provide in-depth information.
Quality of reproduction is one of the biggest strengths of magazines. It allows the advertiser’s
products and brand image to be presented in a format superior to the quality of newspapers. Food
companies especially like the ability to
make their products look appetizing.
Health of the Magazine Industry The
magazine industry hasn’t suffered as
much from the recession and changing
media environment as newspapers
have. Although single-copy sales were
down at the end of 2009, these sales
make up a small slice (2 percent) of
magazine circulation. More impor-
tantly, circulation from subscriptions
was basically stable—down only 1 per-
cent.3 The “Power of Print” ad by a
group of magazine publishers com-
pares the lasting quality of print with
the ephemeral nature of Web content.4

growing market segments such as com-
puter users, skateboarders, and scrap-
bookers. But the greatest growth area is
in online magazines, called zines, and
the online versions of traditional printed
magazines. For the Oscars, for example,
People magazine (www.people.com),
Vanity Fair (www.vanityfair.com), and
Entertainment Weekly (www.ew.com)
dedicated sections of their websites to
this event, piggybacking on the immense
viewership—second only to the Super
Bowl—the Oscars capture.
Given the growth of zines, maga-
zines are trying to figure out their new
future with both hard and online copies.
One of the most interesting dilemmas is
Wired magazine, the publication that

tion at the giant magazine publisher; its
website, however, is the most popular of all Conde Nast sites. So issues about the digital future
sometimes read like arguments for the print magazine’s future. The question the editors debate is
this: What happens to the website if Conde Nast decides to eliminate the print version?5
Meredith, the giant publisher of magazines such as Better Homes & Gardens and Ladies
Home Journal,is searching for new revenue with custom publishing, e-mail, social media, and
mobile campaigns for major marketers who are also its advertisers. For Kraft Foods Meredith
publishes Spanish-language magazines, designs Kraft’s website, and coordinates weekly e-mail
blasts that feature recipe ideas. It also built Kraft’s iFood Assistant, an app for cell phones that in-
cludes recipes, how-to videos, and shopping lists.6

• Professional magazinesaimed at physicians, lawyers, and other professionals; National

• Farm magazinesaimed at those working in agriculture; Farm JournalandFeed and Grain
are examples.
• Corporate publications are produced by companies for their customers and other
stakeholders. Airline magazines are a good example.
Business magazines are also classified as vertical or horizontal publications. Avertical publi-
cationpresents stories and information about an entire industry. Women’s Wear Daily,for example,
discusses the production, marketing, and distribution of women’s fashions. Ahorizontal publication
deals with a business function that cuts across industries, such as Direct Marketing. In terms of ve-
hicle selection, a number of factors influence how media planners fit magazines into their media mix:
• GeographyMany magazines have a national audience, but some cater to certain sections or
regions of the country or have regional editions. The area covered may be as small as a city
(Los Angeles MagazineandBoston Magazine) or as large as several contiguous states (the
360 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
southwestern edition of Southern Living Magazine). Geographic editions help encourage lo-
cal retail support by listing the names of local distributors in the advertisements. Most na-
tional magazines also offer a zone edition that carries different ads and perhaps different
stories, depending on the region of the country.
• DemographicsDemographic editions group subscribers according to age, income, occupation,
and other classifications. Some magazines for example, publish a special “ZIP” edition for
upper-income homes sent to subscribers who live in specific zip codes and who typically share
common demographic traits, primarily based on income. Newsweekoffers a college edition, and
Timesends special editions to students, business executives, doctors, and business managers.
• Editorial ContentEach magazine emphasizes a certain type of editorial content. The most
widely used categories are general editorial (Reader’s Digest), women’s (Family Circle),
shelter (House Beautiful), business (Forbes), and special interest (Ski).
• Physical CharacteristicsMedia planners and buyers need to know the physical characteris-
tics of a magazine because ads containing various elements of words and pictures require a
different amount of space. The most common magazine page sizes are 8 1/2 (cid:5)11 inches
and 6 (cid:5)9 inches. Ads running in Reader’s Digest,which is a 6 (cid:5)9 format, allow for fewer
visuals and little copy.
• OwnershipSome magazines are owned by publishing companies (Glamour,Brides,Vanity
Fair,andThe New Yorkerare owned by Condé Nast), and some are published by organiza-
tions such as AARP. Some magazines are published by consumer companies, such as Kraft’s
Food & Family,that sell ads and carry stories and ads for many of their own products.
• Distribution and CirculationMagazine revenues come from advertising, subscriptions, and
single-copy sales. According to the MPA, advertising in general contributes 55 percent of
magazine revenue and circulation is 45 percent (subscriptions 32 percent; single-copy sales
13 percent).7
Controlled versus Uncontrolled Circulation Traditional delivery, called controlled circula-
tion,is through newsstand purchases or home delivery via the U.S. Postal Service. These are mea-
sured media and their circulation or sales can be determined. Nontraditional delivery,referred to
as uncontrolled circulation, means that the magazine is distributed free to specific audiences.
Generally speaking, uncontrolled (free) circulation magazines have lower readership and therefore
also lower ad costs. They may also be sponsored by a company and sent to key stakeholders as part
of a corporate communication program. In addition to mail, other nontraditional delivery methods
include hanging bagged copies on doorknobs, inserting magazines in newspapers (such as Parade
magazine), delivering through professionals’offices (doctors and dentists), direct delivery (com-
pany magazines or those found on airplanes), and electronic delivery, which is being used by or-
ganizational and membership publications, such as university alumni magazines.
Magazine Ad Sales Like newspapers, magazine ad costs are based on the size of the ad and the
circulation of the magazine. Media planners and buyers analyze a magazine’s circulation so they
can assess circulation potential and determine whether the audiences that best match a campaign’s
target will be reached. In deciding in which magazines to place ads, advertisers need to consider
factors such as format and technology.
Although the format may vary from magazine to magazine, all magazines share some for-
mat characteristics. For example, the inside front and back cover pages are the most costly for ad-
vertisers because they have the highest level of exposure compared to all the other pages in a
magazine. The inside back cover is also a premium position.
Normally, the largest unit of ad space that magazines sell is the double-page spread, in
which two ad pages face each other. Adouble-page ad must jump the gutter,the white space run-
ning between the inside edges of the pages, meaning that no headline words can run through the
gutter and that all body text is on one side or the other. Apage without outside margins, in which
the ad’s ink extends to the very edge of the page, is called a bleed.Magazines sometimes offer
more than two connected pages (four is the most common number) that fold in on themselves.
This kind of ad is called a gatefold.The use of multiple pages that provide photo essays is an ex-
tension of the gatefold concept.

Technology New technologies have enabled magazines to distinguish themselves from one an-
other. For example, selective bindingandink-jet imagingallow publishers to personalize issues
for individual subscribers. Selective binding combines information on subscribers kept in a data-
base with a computer program to produce magazines that include special sections for subscribers
based on their demographic profiles. Ink-jet imaging allows a magazine such as U.S. News &
World Reportto personalize its renewal form so that each issue contains a renewal card already
filled out with the subscriber’s name, address, and so on. Personalized messages can be printed
directly on ads or on inserts (“Mr. Jones—check out our new mutual fund today”).

Satellite transmission, along with computerized editing technology, allows magazines to
print regional editions with regional advertising. This technology also permits publishers to close
pages (stop accepting new material) just hours before press time (instead of days or weeks as in
the past) so that advertisers can drop up-to-the-minute information in their ads. Sophisticated
database management lets publishers combine the information available from subscriber lists
with other public and private lists to create complete consumer profiles for advertisers.

Severalcompaniesattempttoverifythecirculationofmagazines,alongwiththedemographic
andpsychographiccharacteristicsofspecificreaders.As with newspapers, the Audit Bureau of
Circulation is responsible for verifying circulation numbers. Created in 1914, the ABC audits sub-
scriptions as well as newsstand sales and also checks the number of delinquent subscribers and
rates of renewal. MediaMark, which provides a service called MRI, is the industry leader in mag-
azine readership measurement. MRI measures readership for many popular national and regional
magazines (along with other media). Reports are issued to subscribers twice a year and cover
readership by demographics, psychographics, and product use. The Simmons Market Research
Bureau (SMRB) provides psychographic data on who reads which magazines and which prod-
ucts these readers buy and consume. Other research companies such as Starch and Gallup and
Robinson provide information about magazine audience size and behavior.
One problem with these measurement services is the limited scope of their services. MRI,
for example, only measures about 210 magazines. That leaves media buyers in the dark regard-
ing who is actually seeing their ads in magazines not covered by MRI’s research. Without the
services of an objective (outside) measurement company, advertisers must rely on the data from
the magazines themselves, which may be biased.
One interesting change in magazine measurement is the move, which is supported by the
MPA, to quantify the “experience” of reading the magazine, rather than just the circulation and
readers-per-copy. Amajor study to pilot test this concept was conducted by the MPA, the North-
western University Media Management Center, and the American Society for Magazine Editors
(ASME). The study identified a set of 39 types of experiences that people report having with their
magazines. More importantly, the study found that the more engaged people were in the maga-
zine experience, the more impact the advertising had.9
362 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
Directories
Newspapers and magazines are important print media types, but directory advertising is another
form that is particularly effective at driving specific types of consumer responses. Directories are
books like the Yellow Pagesthat list the names of people or companies, their phone numbers, and
their addresses. In addition to this information, many directories publish advertising from mar-
keters who want to reach the people who use the directory. Corporations, associations, and other
organizations, such as non-profits, also publish directories either in print or online that include
members, as well as other stakeholders. These are often provided as a service to members as part
of a corporate communication program.
Directory advertising is designed to get attention, communicate key information about the
organization, reinforce the company’s brand image and position, and drive behavior, the hardest
of all facets of advertising effects to achieve. The Terminix ads illustrate how this complex set of
objectives was accomplished by the winner of a student advertising competition. The Terminix
judges commented that Tran’s ads were “terrific examples of creating an unexpected visual with-
out distracting from the main message.” The judges explained that “this visual coupled with the
explicit copy points (all presented in a clean, accessible layout) differentiate (in a very positive
way) Terminix from its directory competitors.” Tran’s package included a large directory ad, a
small directory ad, and an Internet directory ad.
One of the biggest advantages of advertising in directories is that if people have taken the ini-
tiative to look for a business or service, then the listing is reaching an audience already in the market
for something and ready to take action. Directory advertising doesn’t have to create a need because
it is a number one shopping aid as reflected in the classic Yellow Pages slogan: “Let Your Fingers Do
the Walking.” That’s why directory advertising’s biggest ad-
vantage is directional advertising:it tells people where to go
to get the product or service they want. If you are going to move
across town and you want to rent a truck, you will consult the
local phone book. As the A Matter of Principlefeature explains,
directory advertising is the main medium that prospects consult
once they have decided to buy something they need or want.

The biggest change for this medium is the advent of online directory information, as well as
the decline in landline phones because of the growth of cell phone usage. Directories are expen-

distribution of the residential books. Some directory providers are using an “opt-in” program for

Other Print Media
At this time, we don’t know what Kindle and its other e-book siblings will offer to advertisers,
although there’s sure to be some angle. But books, even in print, have been and are being used as
promotional tools. Anumber of marketing communication agencies have published books, for ex-
ample, that focus on the thoughts of their founders and the philosophies of their agencies: Crispin
Porter(cid:2)Bogusky and Hoppla, Leo Burnett’s Leo, DDB’s Bill Bernbach Said,and Ogilvy and
Mather’s Ogilvy on Advertising.More recently a bank in Brazil presented 120 reasons why peo-
ple should be customers of Banco Bradesco—one reason per page. The book is at the center of
the bank’s customer acquisition program.11
The biggest change, however, may be coming in the form of the iPad, which may turn out
to be the electronic savior of newspapers and magazines because its technology permits a larger
page layout than ebooks. Wall Street Journalads, for example, helped launch the iPad with an ap-
peal to download the WSJ for iPad from the iTunes App Store. Publishers hoped the new device
would restore ad revenue they had lost to online publications.12
WHAT ARE THE OUT-OF-HOME MEDIA CHARACTERISTICS?
Out-of-home advertising includes everything from billboards to hot-air balloons. That means
ads on public spaces, including buses, posters on building walls (barn roofs in the old days), tele-
phone and shopping kiosks, painted and wrapped cars and semi-trucks, taxi signs and mobile bill-
boards, transit shelters and rail platforms, airport and bus terminal displays, hotel and shopping
mall displays, in-store merchandising signs, grocery store carts, shopping bags, public restroom
walls, skywriting, in-store clocks, and aisle displays. Even tall, highly visible grain silos have
been recycled into huge Coke cans in Emporia, Kansas; a 50-foot fiddle in Green Island, Iowa;
and a beer can in Longmont, Colorado. And don’t forget blimps and airplanes towing messages
over your favorite stadium.
In addition to being one of the most creative vehicles for delivering brand messages, as the
LATCH billboard demonstrates, out-of-home media is also a big and growing segment of the me-
dia industry. Although total spending on out-of-home media is hard to determine because of the in-
dustry’s diversity, this category ranks second only to the Internet as the fastest growing marketing
communication industry.13
Why is it such a growth area? Out-of-home advertising’s defining characteristic is that it is
situational: it can target specific people with specific messages at a time and place when they may
be most interested. Asign at the telephone kiosk reminds you to call for reservations at your fa-

locations. many advertisers.
Outdoor Advertising
One of the growth areas in the out-of-
home category is outdoor advertis-
ing,which refers to billboards along
streets and highways, as well as
posters in other public locations. Of
the nearly $6 billion spent on tradi-
tional outdoor advertising, billboard
ads accounted for approximately 60
percent; street furniture, such as signs
on benches, and transit ads brought in
the rest.

sign illustrates. Asecond use for billboards is directional; it
acts as primary medium when the board is in proximity to
where a brand is available. The travel and tourism industries
are major users of billboards directing travelers to hotels,
restaurants, resorts, gas stations, and other services.
Size and Format In terms of size and format, there are two
traditional kinds of billboards: printed poster panels and
painted bulletins. Printed postersare created by the adver-
tiser or agency, printed, and shipped to an outdoor advertis-
ing company. The prepasted posters are then applied in
sections to the poster panel’s face on location, much like
applying wallpaper. They come in two sizes based on the
number of sheets of paper used to make the image: 8 sheet
(5(cid:5)11 feet) and 30 sheet (12 (cid:5)25 feet). The other kind is
the painted outdoor bulletin, which differ from posters in
that they are normally created on site and vary in size or
shape, although their standard size is 14 (cid:5)48 feet. They can
be painted on the sides of buildings, on roofs, and even nat-
ural structures, such as the side of a mountain. Designers can
addextensionsto painted billboards to expand the scale and
break away from the limits of the long rectangle. These em-
bellishments are sometimes called cutouts because they
present an irregular shape.
Outdoor LED boards are brightly lit plastic signs with
electronic messaging. These signs come in a variety of sizes,
colors, and brightness. Another innovation for billboards,
electronic posters, and kiosks is the use of digital displays.

company, is promoting the idea of fitting the approximately

could power approximately 1.5 million homes.14
Because of the very short time consumers are normally exposed to a traditional billboard
message (typically, three to five seconds), the message must be short and the visual must be very
attention getting. No more than 8 to 10 words is the norm. An example of an unusual billboard
with immense attention-getting power is the Microsoft Vista billboard with wire dancers that ap-

Outdoor Ad Sales The cost of outdoor advertising is based on the percent of population in a
specified geographical area exposed to the ad in one day. This is typically based on a traffic
count—that is, the number of vehicles passing a particular location during a specified period of
time, called a showing. If an advertiser purchases a “100 showing,” the basic standard unit is the
number of poster boards in each market that will expose the message to 100 percent of the mar-
ket population every day. If three posters in a community of 100,000 people achieve a daily ex-
posure to 75,000 people, the result is a 75 showing. Conversely, in a small town with a population
of 1,200 and one main street, one board may produce a 100 showing. As you can see, the number
of boards required for a 100 showing varies from city to city.
Advertisers can purchase any number of units (75, 50, or 25 showings daily are common
quantities). Boards are usually rented for 30-day periods, with longer periods possible. Painted
bulletins are bought on an individual basis, usually for one, two, or three years.
CHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 367
On-Premise Signs
Retail signs that identify stores have been with us throughout
recorded history and are today the most ubiquitous form of
brand communication. Signs are found on small independent
businesses, restaurants and chains like Starbucks, hospitals,
movie theaters, and other public facilities like zoos and large
regional shopping centers. In this complex environment an
effective sign may be relatively simple, like McDonald’s gi-
ant M, or more complex, like those found on the strip in Las
Vegas with their large illuminated and animated visual ex-
travaganzas.
Some on-premise signs also act like billboards. Ameri-
can Eagle Outfitters, for example, has a 15,000-square-foot
sign above its Broadway store in New York City. The sign
has 12 panels and operates 18 hours a day. The company Out-of-home advertising, such as this on-premise sign from

building, every store, needs a sign.
Posters
Posters are used on kiosks, bulletin boards, the sides of buildings, and even vehicles. In London,
daily hand-lettered posters have been used for centuries to announce newspaper headlines, and
the walls of the subway or Tube stations in London are lined with posters advertising all kinds of
products, but particularly theater shows. The iPod was launched in London with walls of posters
that Tube riders encountered coming up or down the escalators. The walls were papered with the
distinctive silhouetted images against their neon backgrounds. The repetition of the images cre-
ated a strong billboarding effect.

Special structures called kiosksare designed for public posting of notices and advertising
posters. Kiosks are typically located in places where people walk, such as a many-sided structure
in a mall or near a public walkway, or where people wait. The location has a lot to do with the de-
sign of the message. Some out-of-home media serve the same function as the kiosk, such as the
ad-carrying bus shelter. The series of posters for Dallas-based Texins Activity Center were con-
tributed by Michael Dattolico.
Transit Advertising
Transit advertising is mainly an urban mass advertising form that places ads on vehicles such as
buses and taxis that circulate through the community as moving billboards. Some of these use
striking graphics, such as the designs on the sides of the Mayflower moving trucks. Transit ad-
vertising also includes the posters seen in bus shelters and train, airport, and subway stations.
Most of these posters must be designed for quick impressions, although people who are waiting
on subway platforms or bus shelters often study these posters, so here they can present a more in-
volved or complicated message than a billboard can.

Using Print and Out-of-Home Media Effectively
This review of print and out-of-home advertising should be helpful in explaining when and why
various types of media are included in a media mix. To summarize these key decisions, consider
using newspaper advertising for messages that include an announcement of something new.
Newspapers are also good for targeting local markets. Magazines are great for targeting people
with special interests. They also have great production values and are good for messages that ei-
ther focus on brand image or need space for a more complete explanation.
Outdoor advertising targets audiences on the move and provides directional information.
Outdoor messages are also good for brand reminders. Directory ads catch people when they
are shopping. The following table summarizes the advantages and limitations of these various
media:

What that means, in terms of our Facets of Effects Model, is that broadcast is more enter-
taining, using both drama and emotion to attract attention and engage the feelings of the audience.
Radio is a talk, news, or music-driven medium, where advertisements can also engage the imag-
ination to create stories in the mind. In contrast, television has movie-like qualities that bring sto-
ries to life and create powerful brand imagery. You can see that in the images from the LATCH

demonstrated. Both radio and television use music for emotional impact and to intensify memory
of the message through the repetition of tunes and sounds.

The United States has more than 10,000 commercial radio stations, and most of them, except for
the new Internet stations, have a limited geographical reach. In recent years the radio industry’s

the system. Some of the networks include ABC Radio, Clear Channel Com-
munications, CNN Radio Network, the Fox Sports and Fox News networks,
and others that deliver special-interest programming, such as talk radio.
Localpublic radiostations are usually affiliates of National Public Ra-
dio (NPR) and carry much of the same programming, although they have to
buy or subscribe to the NPR services. For that reason, some local public ra-
dio stations might carry a full range of NPR programming, while others that
are less well funded may only carry a partial list of NPR programs.
Public radio stations are considered noncommercial in that they rely on
listener support for most of their funding. In recent years, however, they
have slowly expanded their corporate sponsorship messages. Although pub-
lic television is losing market share to the many new cable competitors, pub-
lic radio is growing relative to its competitors. Likewise, corporate
underwriting (or sponsorship) has increased along with the audience size be-
cause public radio is one of the few media that can deliver an audience of
well-educated, affluent consumers.

Recent research has provided some findings that bode well for radio. One study, for exam-
ple, found that radio listeners are far less likely to change the dial during ads than are television
viewers. An unexpected 92 percent listen through the four- and six-minute commercial pods. The
percent is even higher for in-car listeners. The study also found a high level of loyalty among lis-
teners for their favorite station.20

This drive-time audience is getting ready for work or commuting to work, and radio is the best

Measuring the Radio Audience The radio industry and independent research firms provide sev-
eral measures for advertisers, including a station’s coverage,which is similar to circulation for print
media. This is simply the number of homes in a geographic area that can pick up the station clearly,
whether those homes are actually tuned in or not. Abetter measure is station or program ratings,
which measures the percent of homes actually tuned in to the particular station. Factors such as com-
peting programs, types of programs, and time of day or night influence the circulation figure.
The Arbitron Ratings Company estimates the size of radio audiences for more than 250 mar-
kets in the United States.Arbitron has been using a seven-day, self-administered diary. Anew tech-
nology Arbitron is rolling out called the Portable People Meter (PPM) is a pager-size device that
detects codes embedded in the audio programming regardless of where the device—whether tra-
ditional radio, computer, or cell phone—is located. The device has been found to be quite effective
at predicting audience interest, even leading to some major format changes such as when WRFF
in Philadelphia switched from a Spanish-language talk show format to alternative rock after new
PPM data revealed that rock music was more popular with the WRFF audience.
Radio Advertising The first radio commercials hit the air in 1922 in New York and advertised
a real estate firm. These early ads were highly successful for many of the same reasons that keep
radio popular today with advertisers. The radio listening experience is unlike that of any other
media, creating both challenges and opportunities for radio advertisers. It can be a more intimate
experience, because we tend to listen to it alone, particularly for people wearing headphones. In
cars, where many people listen to radio, it offers advertisers something close to a captive audi-
ence. And it’s relatively inexpensive both to produce commercials and buy airtime. Check out
the Radio Ranch website, www.radio-ranch.comfor a look behind the scenes of radio commer-
cial production.
Media planners use radio to deliver a high level of frequency because radio commercials,
particularly jingles, which are commercials set to music, lend themselves to repetition. Barry
Manilow was awarded an Honorary CLIO Award recognizing his long career as a jingle writer.
One of his best known is the catchy Band-Ad jingle, “I am stuck on Band-Aid brand cuz Band-
Aid’s stuck on me.” Hear this classic at www.youtube.com/watch?v(cid:4)_7MtLNK02lI.
Radio can also engage the imagination more than other media because it relies on the lis-
tener’s mind to fill in the visual element. Many radio ads use drama, especially public service

announcements (PSAs), which are spots created by agen-

good cause. PSAs run for free on radio and TV stations.

• Network Radio AdvertisingNetwork advertising can be
bought from national networks that distribute program-
ming and advertising to their affiliates. Aradio network
is a group of local affiliates connected to one or more na-
tional networks through telephone wires and satellites.
The five major radio networks are Westwood One, CBS,
ABC, Unistar, and Clear Channel. The largest network
by far is Clear Channel, with more than 1,200 stations.
Satellite transmission has produced important technolog-
ical improvements that also make it easier to distribute
advertising to these stations. Many advertisers view net-

rates. Buying spot radio and coping with its nonstandardized rate structures can be cum-
bersome, however.
• Syndicated Radio AdvertisingThis is the original type of radio programming that plays on a
large number of affiliated stations, such as the Paul Harvey show, which is broadcast on
some 1,200 stations. Program syndicationhas benefited network radio because it offers ad-
vertisers a variety of high-quality, specialized, and usually original programs. Both networks
and private firms offer syndication. Alocal talk show may become popular enough to be
“taken into syndication.” Advertisers value syndicated programming because of the high
level of loyalty of its audience.
The growth of network radio has contributed to an increase in syndicated radio, creating more ad-
vertising opportunities for companies eager to reach new markets. In fact, syndication and net-
work radio have practically become interchangeable terms.
Using Radio Effectively We have seen that radio is highly targeted and that makes it a great tool
for reaching audiences through specialized programming, such as talk shows and musical inter-
ests. Radio advertising messages tend to have a higher level of acceptance than television because
radio listeners are more loyal to their favorite programs and stations. The Radio Advertising
CHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 373
Bureau (RAB) promotes radio as having a dynamic consumer engagement that can be measured
using audience metrics of reach, relevance, and receptivity.
Although radio may not be a primary medium for most businesses, it does have excellent
reminder and reinforcement capability and is great about building frequency through repeti-
tion, particularly if the message can be delivered through a jingle. It also sparks the imagina-
tion because of its ability to stimulate mental imagery through the theater of the mind, which
uses humor, drama, music, and sound effects to tell a story. It also brings the persuasive power
and warmth of a human voice. Agood example is the series of Tom Bodett’s Motel 6 commer-
cials by the Dallas-based Richards Group. Listen to them at http://adland.tv/search/node/
Motel%206.
To maximize the impact of a radio spot, timing is critical and depends on understanding the
target audience’s aperture, which is particularly important in radio with its “drive-time” daypart.
Aperturemeans knowing when the target audience is most likely to be listening and responsive.
Restaurants run spots before meals; auto dealerships run spots on Friday and Saturday, when
people are free to visit showrooms; and jewelry stores run spots before Christmas, Valentine’s
Day, and Mother’s Day. For fast-food franchises, radio buys at the local level supplement na-
tional television. Radio acts as a reminder, with spots concentrated during morning drive time,
noon, and evening drive time. The messages focus on the location of local restaurants and spe-
cial promotions. Radio is also flexible and allows for easy changes to schedules. For example,
a local hardware store can quickly implement a snow-shovel promotion the morning after a
snowstorm.
Adisadvantage of radio is that it plays in the background for many of our activities. Although
the radio is on, the multitasking listener may not really be listening to or concentrating on the mes-
sage. Listeners tend to tune in and tune out as something catches their attention, which is why ef-
fective radio advertising is designed to “break through” the surrounding clutter. Generally radio
ad clutter is lower than television clutter, which averages 15 to 20 minutes per hour of commer-
cials versus 10 to 15 minutes on radio. Also, the lack of visuals on radio can be a problem for
products that need to be demonstrated.
Television Basics
Television has become a mainstay of society with, on average, some 280 million sets in use in the
United States. Television approaches the universality of radio with 98 percent of American house-
holds having one or more television sets. In over half of U.S. households, the TVis on “most” of
the time. The U.S. television audience, however, is highly fragmented, tuning in to 100 or more
different channels. Nielsen Media Research estimates that the average U.S. household has the set
on more than five hours a day.21
Television is primarily an entertainment medium although a recent trend, called “behavior
placement,” is experimenting with moving TVprograms into social behavior modification. For
example, a segment of The Officeturned one of the actors into a superhero obsessed with recy-
cling. Scripting positive behaviors into TVshows is seen as a way to model positive behaviors
and influence viewers.22
Television’s use also expanded with the introduction of the Wii, which makes the home
TVscreen a facilitator in exercise programs, as well as games. As computers begin to use TV
screens to project their content, this cross-channel merger will open up entirely new uses for
home TVs.
The heavy use of television by children is of concern to parents and early childhood experts.
Recent studies found that U.S. children spend an average of nearly four hours a day watching tel-
evision, DVDs, and videos. Furthermore, three-fourths of sixth graders have a TVin their bed-
room. Advertisers are happy to hear that kids haven’t totally abandoned TV programming for
games and the Web, but these numbers are still worrisome for critics of children’s programming
and advertising.

In an interesting experiment with television costs and revenue, in early 2010 NBC moved
Jay Leno from his late-night time slot to a 10:00 p.m. time (EST) five nights a week. The network
gambled that his show would be cheaper to produce than the scripted programs that characterize
prime time. Of course, his program would probably also have lower ratings, but the trade-off was
worthwhile given the lower program costs. What that decision ignored was the importance of
those scripted shows with their higher ratings to the local affiliates who get a share of the revenue
from those shows. The lower ratings also hurt their revenue stream from both national and local
advertising. Even worse, the Leno show ended up being a weaker “lead-in” for the local stations’
11:00 p.m. newscasts. So what seemed to be a savvy business decision played havoc with the
budgets of more than 200 affiliates and six months later the network moved Leno back to his
11:30 p.m. slot. Even though the network made money by saving on production costs, it created
a firestorm of complains from affiliates who lost ratings and advertising revenues.24

Structure of the Television Industry To better understand how television works, let’s first con-
sider its structure and programming options. Then we’ll look at television as an advertising
medium, the way it connects with its audience, and its advantages and disadvantages. The key
types of television delivery systems include network, subscription (cable and satellite), pay pro-
gramming, local and public television, and syndication.
Network Television Abroadcast networkis a distribution system that provides television con-
tent to its affiliated stations. Currently, there are four national, over-the-air television networks in
the United States: the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), the Columbia Broadcasting Sys-
tem (CBS), the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), and Fox Broadcasting. The big three net-
works’hold on the viewing audience has dropped from 75 percent in 1987 to less than 30 percent.
When Fox is included, networks still only capture less than half of the audience. The networks
suffered in the recession except for Fox, which, in 2010 made more money than the evening news-
casts of NBC, ABC, and CBS combined.25
Each network has about 150 affiliates. The network sells some commercial time to national
advertisers and leaves some open for the affiliates to fill with local advertising. Affiliates pay their

respective networks 30 percent of the fees they charge local advertisers. In turn, affiliates receive
a percentage of the advertising revenue (12 to 25 percent) paid to the national network. This ad-
vertising is the primary source of affiliate revenues.
Subscription Television Cable is the most familiar example of subscription television,which
means that people sign up for service and pay a monthly fee. Subscription television is a delivery
system that carries the television signal to subscribers. Cable televisionis a form of subscription
TV. It has grown into a national network of channels that provide highly targeted special-interest
programming options. The impact of cable programming has been to fragment the audience and
make it difficult to reach a large, mass audience. Cable has become a significant threat to the fi-
nancial health of the networks. Viewing time for cable also has increased as the quality of the pro-
gramming has improved and advertisers have found that “narrowcasting,” which uses cable’s
special-interest programs to reach more tightly targeted audiences, can be even more efficient
than mass broadcasting. The Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau found that ad-supported cable
has taken over the lead from the broadcast networks.26Satellite television is similar to cable in
that it’s just a competing delivery system.
Some of the best programming in recent years, such as the award-winning Sopranosshow,
have been produced by cable channels. Oprah Winfrey rocked the industry when she announced
she was leaving NBC to set up her own cable channel that would carry her programs.

Pay Programming and On-Demand Programming Pay programming and on-demand program-
ming are available to subscribers for an additional monthly fee. This type of programming offers
movies, specials, and sports under such plans as Home Box Office, Showtime, and The Movie
Channel. Pay networks do not currently sell advertising time.
Local Television Most local television stations are affiliated with a network and carry both net-
work programming and their own programs. Independent stationsare local stations not affiliated
with networks. Costs for local advertising vary, depending on the size of the market and the de-
mand for the programs carried. For example, a major station in Houston may charge local adver-
tisers $2,000 for a 30-second spot during network prime time. This same time slot may cost $50 in
a smaller town. Most advertisers for the local market are local retailers, primarily department stores
or discount stores, financial institutions, automobile dealers, restaurants, and supermarkets. Ad-
vertisers buy time on a station-by-station basis. National advertisers sometimes buy local adver-
tising on a city-by-city basis, using spot buys.They do this to align the buy with their product
distribution, to “heavy-up” a national schedule to meet competitive activities, or to launch a new
product in selected cities. Even some cable channels are attempting to localize their programming

to gain ground in this market. ESPN, for example, which dominates national and international
sports viewing, is testing the use of local websites to report on hometown sports teams.

lines. Some PBS stations accept the same ads that appear on paid programming. However, most
PBS spots are created specifically for public stations. Some PBS stations will not accept any com-
mercial corporate advertising, but they do accept noncommercial ads that are “value neutral”—
in other words, ads that make no attempt to sell a product or service.
Syndication An important revenue stream for networks and cable channels, such as HBO, that
produce original programming is syndication. As in radio programming, television syndication
refers to content providers that sell their programs to independent firms and other cable channels
to replay as reruns. Some of the most popular first-run programs, such as HouseandLaw & Or-
der,are valuable properties and move quickly into syndication.
New Technology and Innovative Television New technology is having an impact on program-
ming options, as well as on distribution patterns and systems. Innovations, such as high-definition
TVand interactive TV, expand advertising opportunities.
High-definition TV (HDTV)is a type of TVstandard that delivers movie-quality, high-res-
olution images. All over-the-air stations broadcast their programming in an HDTVformat. It’s
been a struggle, however, getting enough HDTVprogramming broadcast to build demand on the
consumer side. As stations upgraded their equipment and moved to HDTVby 2009, the increased
availability of HDTVprogramming made it necessary for consumers to upgrade to HDTVsets.
Say you’re watching your favorite program and a commercial comes on for a product that
interests you. Abutton pops up on the screen that you can click with your remote and you are
asked questions about whether you want more information, a coupon, or to give some other re-

advertisers give their ads to TiVo, for example, where codes are embedded. The ads are then dis-
tributed to TVand cable networks. When the ad airs, the digital video recorder boxes pick up the
coding and turn on the interactive component for that subscriber. Axe used it to show young men

Anumber of researchers are testing the feasibility of bringing 3-D televisionto living rooms
by improving on current technology and its use of special glasses. One technology involves a set-
top box, and 3-D sets are being tested by Japanese and Korean electronics rivals; Sony and ESPN
are particularly focused on this new market.28British Sky Broadcasting is proposing a special 3-D
television channel that will provide content for these new sets. In the United States several 2010
Super Bowl ads were filmed in 3-D. The logistics are difficult but 3-D may finally be on its way
to home television sets.
378 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
Traditional forms of network television are being threatened
byonline video.After Comcast bid to buy NBC, one of the ideas
floated by the new management team involved subscription fees
for NBC—hoping to make the previously ad-supported network
more like premium cable. The new combined media and enter-
tainment company also considered bringing the cable-TV sub-
scription model to the Web and its online video programming.29
Another technology that is having a profound effect on tele-
vision programming and the way people watch television is the
digital video recorder (DVR),such as TiVo. DVR systems allow
users to record favorite TVshows and watch them whenever they
like. The technology makes it possible to record the programming
without the hassles of videotape, letting users pause, do instant re-
plays, and begin watching programs even before the recording has
finished. This capability is known as time-shifting.
DVRs are a threat to marketers because it allows consumers
to zip past commercials completely. It also is forcing advertisers to
rethink the design of their ads, recognizing that they have 3 to
4 seconds, at best, to win the attention of button-happy viewers. It
also raises the issue of how advertisers should respond. Some are
experimenting with new ways to send messages that immediately
engage attention. Coca-Cola and TiVo, for example, have created
ads that appear on screen as a small text box when viewers pause
a show.30
Advertisers and television executives are alarmed over the
increasing popularity of time-shifting technology. It calls into

ANielsen study, however, found that viewers are not zipping through commercials as much
as advertisers feared. To further understand this pattern, TiVo has also announced that it is con-
sidering a service that will provide second-by-second data about which programs the company’s
subscribers are watching and which commercials they are skipping.
Measuring the Television Audience Agreat number of advertisers consider television their pri-
mary medium. Can television deliver a target audience to advertisers effectively? What do we re-
ally know about how audiences watch television? Is it a background distraction? Do we switch
from channel to channel without watching any single show? Or do we carefully and intelligently
select what we watch on television?
Principle Television viewers are sometimes irritated by the intrusiveness of advertising and are not re-

A. C. Nielsen is the research company that dominates the television measurement industry.
Exposure is television’s equivalent to circulation. Exposure measures households with sets
turned on, a population referred to as households using television (HUT). But a HUT figure
doesn’t tell you if anyone is watching the program. Remember from Chapter 11that we defined
animpressionas one person’s opportunity to be exposed one time to an ad. Like print, the im-
pressions from television—the number of viewers exposed to a program—might be greater than
the number of households reached since there may be more than one viewer watching and the
CHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 379
commercial may be repeated several times in a program or during a time period. We add all of
these impressions up and call them gross impressions.
For television programs, the exposure is estimated in terms of number of viewers. The 2010
Super Bowl was watched by 106 million people, making it the most watched telecast ever, sur-
passing the viewership of the 1983 M*A*S*H final episode. Following those programs, the 1996
Dallas vs. Pittsburgh Super Bowl game drew 97 million viewers and the 2007 Super Bowl fea-
turing the Chicago Bears and Indianapolis Colts, attracted some 93 million viewers.

holdstunedtoanyoneprogram.
• ShareAbetter estimate of impressions might be found in a program’s share of audience,
which refers to the percent of viewers based on the number of sets turned on during a spe-
cific broadcast period. The share figure for a particular program is always larger than its rat-
ing, since the base is smaller. For example, if the Super Bowl gets a rating of 40 (40 percent
of all households with television), its share would be 67 if the total HUTwas 60 percent. In
other words, the Super Bowl has 2/3 (40 divided by 60 (cid:4)67) of all households that have
their television sets turned on during the Super Bowl.
Independent rating firms, such as A. C. Nielsen, provide the most commonly used measure
of national and local television audiences. Nielsen periodically samples a portion of the televi-
sion viewing audience, estimates the size and characteristics of the audiences watching specific
shows, and then makes these data available, for a fee, to advertisers and ad agencies, which use
them in their media planning.
Nielsen’s calculations are based on audience data from about 5,000 measurement instru-
ments, called people meters,which record what television shows are being watched, the number
of households that are watching, and which family members are viewing. The recording is done
automatically; household members indicate their presence by pressing a button. These are placed
in randomly selected households in the 210 television markets in the United States. The company
also uses viewer diaries mailed out during the sweepsperiod, which are quarterly periods when
more extensive audience data and demographics are gathered. About 1 million diaries are re-
turned each year.
Nielsen continues to add people meters in its top markets to track local viewing patterns. Meters
are used only to determine what show is being watched, and not the specific demographics of
who is watching it. Demographic data come from diaries. Anew locally based meter system
would allow Nielsen to identify the age, race, and sex of viewers on a nightly basis. Note that
these ratings are based on programs, and are not measures of specific advertisements.
One interesting finding from an analysis of ratings is that even in this age of DVRs, the lead-
in show does matter. Fox’s American Idol, for example, has been a strong lead-in to other Fox shows
such as Fringe. Another Nielsen finding during the recent recession is the power of ethnic media.
For example, the number one TVstation in Los Angeles isn’t one of the networks, it’s Spanish-lan-
guage KMEX. And it’s not just LA’s top station, Nielsen ranks it as the number one station in the
United States with viewers ages 18 to 49.33
Something not measured by all of these metrics is the dedication of a program’s superfans.
When NBC proposed dropping Chuck, fans launched a campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and TV
blogs in defense of their favorite program. Realizing the significance of the attachment, Subway
jumped in as an ally. To demonstrate the marketing power of ChuckTV.net, a consumer-generated
campaign called “Finale & Footlong” urged fans to buy foot-long sandwiches from Subway to
eat as they watched the season finale. The effort was successful, and NBC announced it would
renew the show.34
380 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
Television Advertising
The first television commercial aired in 1941 when Bulova bought time on
a New York station before a Phillies vs. Dodgers game.35Television is used
for advertising because it works like the movies—it tells stories, engages the
emotions, creates fantasies, and can have great visual impact. Because it’s
an action medium, it is also good for demonstrating how things work. It
brings brand images to life and adds personality to a brand. An example of
the dramatic, emotional power of television comes from one of the greatest
commercials of all time. Called “Iron Eyes Cody,” the Ad Council PSAwas
created as part of an environmental campaign. It shows a Native American
paddling a canoe through a river ruined by trash. Aclose-up shows a tear
from his eye.
Advertising Sales The first decision in designing a television ad is deter-
mining its length, which is usually 10, 15, 30, or 60 seconds. The most com-
mon length is 30 seconds because for most advertisers, the 60-second spot
is considered too expensive. The 10-second ad is like a billboard and sim-
ply announces that a program is “brought to you by . . .” the advertiser.
ESPN is experimenting with these “mini-mercials” and offering in-house
produced ads that combine an advertiser’s message with the lead-in to a
show. For example, in an Asics spot, a runner returns home and turns on his
TV, which shows the ESPN “SportsCenter” logo with its theme song.36
Long-form ads, which are of various lengths, are seen on late-night TV
as “infomercials,” when the cost of broadcast time is much lower than at
other times of day. Late-night infomercials have been the venue for direct-
response television with its promise of how-to-do-it tools and vegetable cut-
ters, as well as get-rich investing. An interesting variation is found in rural
India where traveling performers present live infomercials from mobile
stages to a large and growing population of international brand-focused cus-
tomers. Late-night informercial products like Snuggies and the Windshield
Wonder that clean the insides of car windows are also showing up in retail
stores, such as Walmart, Target, and Bed Bath & Beyond.37
The actual form of a television commercial depends on whether a net-
work, local, or subscription service schedule is used.
• SponsorshipsIn program sponsorships,the advertiser assumes the to-
tal financial responsibility for producing the program and providing the
accompanying commercials. The Hallmark Hall of Fameprogram is an
example of a sponsored program. Sponsorship can have a powerful ef-

today, provides a great deal more flexibility in market coverage, target
audiences, scheduling, and budgeting. Participations do not create the
same high impact as sponsorships, however. Finally, the “time avails”
(available time slots) for the most popular programs are often bought
up by the largest advertisers, leaving fewer good time slots for small
advertisers.
CHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 381
The price of a commercial is based on the rating of the surrounding program (note the
rating is for the program, not the commercial). The price is also based on the daypart during
which the commercial is shown. The following table shows the Television Standard Day-
parts. The most expensive time block is prime time.
• Spot AnnouncementsThe third form a television commercial can take is the spot an-
nouncement.Spot announcements are commercials that appear in the breaks between pro-
grams, which local affiliates sell to advertisers who want to show their ads locally.
Commercials are sold on a station-by-station basis to local, regional, and national advertis-
ers. However, local buyers dominate spot television. PSAs are also distributed to stations for
local play based on the station’s time availability.

Media sales operations are trying to encourage advertising through various types of part-
nerships and cooperative advertising strategies. We have already mentioned ESPN’s “mini-
mercials,” which embed a brand’s reminder ad in the opening of a sports program. Another
example comes from Campbell’s Soup and CBS, which partnered in an advertising campaign that
paired various shows with different types of Campbell soups.

determined that television had more impact, particularly at the awareness stage.38
Television advertising also makes a strong visual and emotional impact. The interaction of
sight, sound, color, motion, and drama creates a stronger emotional response than most other
forms of advertising media. In Chapter 4we mentioned engagement,which certainly applies to
TV. Television is particularly good at creating messages that can be highly engrossing. Even with
TiVo, people still sit through advertisements and use online search engines to seek out advertis-
ing that is relevant to them.39Television is also good for delivering messages that require action,
movement, and demonstration, such as the messages created for Avista Utilities in Portland,
Oregon. When it comes to energy efficiency, Karl Schroeder explains, every little bit adds up—
using energy-efficient bulbs, cleaning the coils on a refrigerator, using Energy Star appliances,
and other environmental practices. To spread this idea and empower customers, the messages
demonstrate different actions folks can take to improve the efficiency of their home.
Television has drawbacks, as well. The commercial breaks between programs can be diffi-
cult time slots for advertisers because there is a great deal of clutter from competing commercials,

targeted than network and spot television, so it has less waste. Disinterest is
another problem because people are often inclined to zip(fast forward) or
zap(change channels) commercials if they don’t have a DVR.
Another big drawback is that television advertising is expensive rela-
tive to other media, both for time and production costs. (Note:Television is
“expensive” in terms of dollar amounts even though it is relatively cheap in
terms of gross impressions because its audience is so much larger than that
of other media.) A30-second, prime-time spot averages about $185,000, and
most advertisers would want to run a commercial multiple times. That av-
erage, however, doesn’t mean much because costs vary considerably for a
highly rated prime-time show versus a lower rated program. Production
costs are higher than ads in other media, as well. They include filming the
commercial (several thousand to several hundred thousand dollars) and
paying the talent—writers, directors, and actors. When celebrities are used,
the price tag can be millions of dollars for the campaign budget.
Another problem is clutter, and its stepchildren, intrusiveness and
irritation. In the past, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) re-
stricted the allowable commercial time per hour to approximately 6 min-
utes, but the Justice Department overturned this restriction and the number
of commercials has increased significantly (up to 20 minutes per hour of
programming). As the number of commercials increases, the visibility and
persuasiveness of television advertising diminishes. As clutter has in-
creased, advertisements are becoming more intrusive to grab attention
from a disinterested and irritated audience. The high irritation level is what
has led viewers to mute and zap commercials.

now equipped to run mini-movies and ads electronically. The
job search company Monster.com has been successful with
trailers that replay as electronic signboard messages in public
spaces—another example of media convergence with video ap-
pearing as out-of-home media.
Promotional Videos
Promotional video networks run sponsored programs and com-
mercials, such as the channels you see in grocery stores, doc-
tor’s offices, and truck stops that distribute commercials by
video or satellites. The pioneer in this arena is Channel M,
which markets customized in-store video programming to such
companies as Payless Shoes and Kampgrounds of America.
Marketers, such as General Electric and Pepsi, are experi-
menting with short video clips—both live-action and animated—
that can be watched free on the video-on-demand service
available to Time Warner cable customers. The shorts can also
be seen on the GE website (www.ge.com/imaginationtheater),
as well as on sites like MySpace, Google Video, and YouTube.
Finally, videos and DVDs are used for product literature, as
well as in public relations for video news releases (VNRs) to
the media.

Looking Ahead
This chapter has provided an overview of traditional media, their characteristics, and their
strengths and weaknesses. But, in truth, traditional media hardly exist any more. An interview on
public radio’s NPR headlined, “In a 24/7 World, What Is a Magazine?” began with this line: “It’s
hard to know what a magazine is these days.” Is it paper? Is it a website? Martin Sorrell, head of
WPP, the world’s largest communication company (125 firms including Ogilvy & Mather and
JWTadvertising agencies) asks: “How do you define a newspaper or a magazine?” He observes,
“I doubt free-to-air television or, in particular, newspapers and magazines, will ever be the same
again.”41This is one of the key points of change that Kelley pointed out in his essay in the Part 4
opener. He observes that all media, including the traditional ones, will have some type of digital
and interactive component and this will only make media selection more challenging.
Not only are these traditional media formats changing, so are the ads that appear in them.
CBS promoted its fall season with ads in the magazine Entertainment Weeklythat contained video
clips of its new programs. Similar to musical greeting cards, the technology used a flexible, thin,
plastic screen that was activated when the two-page ad was opened. The videos also included a
Pepsi Max ad inside the CBS ad. An executive at Time Warner, publisher of EW, observed, “It we
can efficiently put video into magazines, think about the possibilities it would open up.”42
So let’s move on to the exciting and equally fast-changing world of digital media, which are
generating even more new opportunities for marketing communication. The next chapter will re-
view the dynamic world of online communication.
IT’S A WRAP
Aflac’s Duck
Spreads Its Wings
How effective is the Aflac duck? The Kaplan Thaler Group succeeded in creating a campaign that led to a
94 percent awareness of Aflac and an increase of 55 percent in U.S. sales during the first three years
of the campaign, followed by double-digit growth in the following years. This campaign earned a Gold Effie
for the duck who successfully communicated the brand personality as well as the honor of being voted one
of the best-known brand icons.
Will the next generation of this ad campaign be as effective as a new agency uses the duck to challenge
consumers to find out more about the company? Stay tuned.
In the meantime, you can learn much from these campaigns featuring the celebrated odd duck. This case
demonstrates that even in a changing media environment that puts much emphasis on the Web and social
media, traditional media are often critical to a campaign’s effectiveness. Traditional media helped drive con-
sumers to Aflac’s website. All components of the campaign worked together to educate consumers about the
brand, to increase brand comprehension, and have a little fun.
CHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 385
Also, you can learn that even as campaigns evolve, it’s important to stay true to the brand. According to
James Wisdom, senior manager of new media for Aflac, the message in social media, like that in the tradi-
tional media, has to “straddle a fine line between lighthearted quips and corporate messaging.”
Wisdom said, “We work very hard to stay true to the Aflac Duck as he has been defined in the past, while
defining his personality going forward.”
As the campaign takes flight, watch as our fine-feathered friend continues to show his plucky, rock star
personality and build his vocabulary beyond the one word he knows best, “Aflac.”

CHAPTER KEY POINTS
1. How does the Internet work,and what roles does it play in marketing communication?
2. What are the most common types of online marketing communication?
3. In what ways are Internet practices,issues,and trends evolving?
You’re in the (Virtual) Army Now

WaritcreatedaprecursortotheWorldWideWeb,calledtheAdvancedResearch
Projects Agency Network, better known as ARPANET. So when the U.S. Army
wantedtoincreaseitsranks,itwasano-brainertousedigitalmediaforrecruiting.
The revolution from analog to digital technology has brought about two fun-
damental changes facilitated in part by the invention of the personal computer.
First, it made it possible to produce and copy information exactly. Second, it be-
came easy to move information between media and to access or distribute it re-
motely. Interactivity became key.
These abilities have transformed the way people do business. Think about
what you can do with your computer. You can buy music, make airline reservations,
see how that sweater you’re thinking about buying looks in red, or find exotic types
of licorice, publish your own blog, participate in social media, and so on—all things
that would have been impossible before, say, 1995.
It also means that those who are afraid to embrace the changing media envi-
ronment are in danger of getting left behind. Clearly the U.S. Army is marching to
a different drummer when it comes to recruiting than it did before. Here’s what it
did to reach its core audience of 17- to 24-year-olds to achieve the goal of recruit-
ing more than 100,000 new soldiers each year.
It used the latest technologies to show the variety of exciting career opportu-
nities available in the U.S. Army. Since the 1980s the U.S. Army’s use of media has
shifted dramatically away from traditional radio and print media to the Internet.
It also took advantage of the growth of event marketing, unheard of in the
1980s. By 2007, event marketing accounted for about a fifth of the U.S. Army’s
total marketing budget. The U.S. Army typically has sponsored events such as
NASCAR and rodeo bull riding because they shared a common target audience. Re-
alizing they faced the challenging task of recruiting young people in the midst of

260 gigs of processing power to run the experience. Check out its website at

The fast-action, information-rich computer game experience and event im-
mersed participants in the world of soldiering. Prospective recruits viewed videos
of actual soldiers decorated for their actions in combat, and received live and
recorded briefings from team members to prepare for their virtual combat opera-
tion. As they participated in the mission, visitors tested their ability to be a team
member who followed rules of engagement, displayed leadership and Army val-
ues including integrity and respect, and used high-tech equipment. After com-
pleting the mission, participants moved to another area in the exhibit where they
were debriefed on their performance. Soldiers guided participants through a re-
view of the experience and stood ready to answer questions about soldiering.

The U.S. Army is a well-known organization and brand that is using innovative digital and inter-
active communication media to recruit soldiers. The Virtual Army Experience is a great example
of how the new media can be used to engage prospects and persuade them to commit. In this chap-
ter we will discuss a number of interactive media, including the Internet, e-mail, and social me-
dia, that connect people in a network of word-of-mouth communication. It’s a dynamic and
fast-changing media environment that challenges communication planners to not only keep up,
but also get ahead of the technological changes that are driving innovation and making this such
a creative area of marketing communication.
INTERACTIVE MEDIA: WEB 2.0 AND YOU
Because new technology is exploding, media planners are racing to try to understand the impli-
cations of this rapidly changing media landscape for advertising and marketing communication.
New hardware offerings such as super-smart phones, netbooks, smart books (like a smart phone
with a tablet computer), portable video players, and the next generation of e-readers are stirring
the imaginations of early adopters. New operating systems, called platforms, include not only the
iPhone, which has been the innovative leader, but also Research in Motion’s (RIM) Blackberry
and Google’s Android. MySpace, Facebook, Wikipedia, Craigslist, YouTube, Flickr, and Google
are just a few of the sites that provide new tools that permit users to customize messages and in-
teract, which creates new ways of looking at media use by consumers. The Part 4 Introduction by
Larry Kelley highlighted the impact of these changes.

thors of Citizen Marketers say, “Corporate decision makers are losing even the illusion of

Another trend noted in the Part 4 introduction is the convergence and blurring of media
forms, a shift that is challenging media planners, and one we’ll talk more about at the end of the
chapter. The Internet is the ultimate convergence medium because it bridges print and broadcast
media and blurs the distinction between them. Newspapers, magazines, and other print forms can
be delivered online, and their messages still look like print. Video is moving online and even on
to cell phones. We’ve talked about convergence in previous chapters, but the Internet is driving
this trend by creating an increasingly wired and connected world.

Web-delivered messages. Before we talk about Internet marketing communication, let’s first re-
view the basics of the Internet.
Internet Basics
Technically, the Internet is a linked system of international computer networks. The World
WideWebistheinformationinterfacethatallowspeopletoaccesstheInternetthroughaneasy-
to-use graphical format. However, most people use these terms Internet and Web interchange-
ably.The thing to remember is that the Internet, which didn’t come into common use until the

ating a dynamic environment that challenges old ways of doing business. The area seeing the
greatest change is media where traditional print and broadcast forms are reshaping themselves
foranonlinepresence.
The Internet is an important marketing communication medium because it combines the
characteristics of many other media—newspapers and newsletters, magazines, catalogs, directo-
ries, television, radio, phones, and film. It is useful for communicating brand information, but that
capability is a two-edged sword. Any major problem with a brand can be communicated around
the world instantly. Tiger Woods, one of the world’s greatest personal brands, found that out when
his minor car accident on the street outside his Florida home exploded into a blaze of global com-
munication filled with endless speculation and rumors about his life and loves.
The Internet plays a critical role in both consumer and business-to-business (B2B) customers’
brand decisions. Here are some of the reasons why it has become so important to consumers—as
well as the marketers who want to reach them—in such a short time:
• InformationBecause of easy searching, Internet users have access to a wealth of informa-
tion, not only about brands and companies, but also about trends, future developments, and
product reviews.
• ChoiceThe Internet offers more choices and consumers can easily do comparative shopping
online. That means they can learn more about brands, not only from a brand’s website but
also from third parties.
• AccessibilityThemajorityofthepopulationhasaccesstocomputers,andindividualswho
donotcangoonlineatworkorpubliclocations,suchaslibraries,schools,andInternet
cafes.
• SpeedThe Internet has grown to be a medium with unsurpassed speed and widespread cov-
erage. Especially with high-speed connection services, information travels across the Inter-
net almost instantaneously and is carried to almost all parts of the globe.
392 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
Online marketers value the Internet for the same reasons, however they also see benefits in
some basic business areas:
• CapitalOpening a business online is far less costly than opening a traditional brick-and-
mortar business.
• Cost ReductionsSelling online and keeping track of customer relationship behavior with
real-time data is also less costly than operating a traditional brick-and-mortar business.
• LocationThe Internet reaches beyond local markets, which is important for specialty goods.
For example, in Lincoln, NE, a business that specializes in selling licorice would find it hard
to thrive if the owners relied solely on people from the area patronizing it. The Internet al-
lows the market to live in the world, not just in a local location.
Anumber of different “nets” are used in marketing communication beyond the basic Inter-
net. Because it is an interactive “web,” the Internet is a relatively inexpensive communication
medium that connects a company with all of its stakeholders—employees, investors, and other
groups that have a stake in the success of the brand. Companies set up intranetsfor internal com-
munication and extranetsto connect employees with key external stakeholders, such as market-
ing communication agencies, suppliers, and distributors.
Here are some other important Internet terms and tools:
• URLs and Domain NamesAwebsite has an address called a URL(Uniform Resource Lo-
cator), which is its domain name,a global address that identifies a specific location in cy-
berspace on the Web where a document or website lives.
• PortalsAportalis a site that provides doors, or links, to other websites, such as AOLand
MSN. Yahoo!, for example, is a directory, or online guide to the Web. It started as a group of
favorite websites compiled by a couple of Stanford University students, who began catego-
rizing the sites as the list grew into the giant library now known as Yahoo! It is considered
the top Internet brand and is among the most trafficked websites in the United States. The
big three portals—AOL, MSN, and Yahoo!—account for 17 percent of all time spent on the
Internet in the United States. On average, MSN users spend 2 hours online daily, AOLusers
spend 2.5 hours, and Yahoo users spend 3 hours. MSN, however, has the biggest global
share of the three and uses that advantage to drive its other products, such as Internet Ex-
plorer, Windows, its Silverlight Web design application, and its Bing.comsearch engine.2
• LinksAlinkis an address to another website that can be accessed from the website cur-
rently being viewed. Often the links are designed to reflect the topic of the original site. For
example, Nike may have a link on a golf site that allows viewers to move back and forth
from the golf page to Nike’s golf product lines.
• Search EnginesGoogle is the biggest search engineused to find information and access
other sites but it is being challenged by Microsoft’s Bing.com,which also powers Yahoo’s
search function. You don’t have to know a specific website address; instead, you can type in
akeywordand the search engine will seek out all sites that provide information on the topic.
Most search engines also carry advertising, so they can be considered advertising media. Ex-
amples of more specific search sites are SeenOn.com,an online shopping guide that lets TV
fans find and purchase many of the products they see on TV, and iLike.com,which was set up
by musicians to help consumers find music they like. Craigslist provides local community-
basedinformation: who can repair a radio, where to find supplies for stained glass repairs,
how to locate job opportunities, and so on. Craigslist is noncommercial and doesn’t accept
advertising, but brands sometimes can be found there or searched for on the site.
• NetcastingThe emergence of new technology that makes it possible to broadcast TVand ra-
dio online is a practice called netcasting.Blip.tv offers new Web TVseries and helps the
producers find sponsors and advertisers. The decision by ABC to put previously run
episodes of its hit shows online and CBS’s experiments with “March Madness on Demand”
video streams for the college basketball championships are pushing this technological revo-
lution. MTVis working with Google to move its video content to the Web, and Disney has
released some of its movies for use on a video iPod. TVproducers are starting to produce
shows designed for the tiny 2.5-inch cell phone screen. In a new twist on convergence, a
start-up wireless carrier contributed a political parody show it created, the animated Lil’
Bush, to Comedy Central. This is the first time a U.S. TVnetwork broadcast a show that was
CHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 393
initially produced for cell phones. Netcasting also appeals to advertisers searching for new
ways to reach audiences who no longer are sitting in front of televisions.
• BroadbandThe term broadbandis used to indicate a high-speed connection to the Internet.
Slow speeds make it difficult to download large files; higher speed access makes it easier to
access complex files, such as streaming video.Finland has targeted 2015 as the date when
fast Internet connections will be guaranteed to all of its citizens. Other countries have similar
plans, but as of 2010 the U.S. Congress was working through the FCC to catch up and de-
velop similar plans.3Bandwidthis a term used to describe the carrying capacity of an indi-
vidual’s computer connection, that is, how much digital data it can handle.
The Internet Audience
Internet use has expanded over the years from sites appealing to young tech-savvy innovators to
sites devoted to just about any age or interest group. The most sought-after audience on the Web
continues to be young people, particularly young males who are hard to reach with traditional me-
dia. Teens spend more time online—or on their cell phones—than any other age group.

information, game playing, and social contact, although analysts predict that is changing as more
big Chinese brands begin to develop websites and offer products online.6
Internet Marketing
Parallel to the Internet’s ability to create new ways to communicate, it also has created new ways
to do business. We mentioned the size of the China market; in 2009 online transactions accounted
for only 1.2 percent of total retail sales in China compared to 5 percent in the United States, how-
ever, most experts predict that the Chinese will dramatically increase their level of Internet pur-
chases during the 2010s.
Most companies have a website that provides information, but many also sell products on-
line, particularly to the B2B market. These business operations also provide ways to track cus-
tomer behavior and preferences through databases and predictive modeling. Amazon.com, for
example is able to suggest books to a returning customer based on that customer’s previous pur-
chases, as well as search patterns. We referred to this in Chapter 5as behavioral targeting and it
represents one of the innovations resulting from the new technology offered by the Internet.
The online marketer eBay is important because it represents a way of doing business that is
different from traditional brick-and-mortar stores as well as a different way of thinking about buy-
ing, selling, and advertising—person-to-person commerce. It’s also called re-commercebecause
much of its listings are for used items, like an online garage sale. It pioneered a new form of on-
line commerce by linking individuals and small companies who had goods and services to sell
with people interested in buying those products. Craigslist has done the same thing for local ser-
vices and classified advertising.
In a novel experiment, GM tried selling new cars in California on eBay. The program ended

launch of Toyota’s new V-8 Tundra truck,
Toyota realized that many of the full-sized
truck buyers are the kind of people who
want to do things for themselves and put
their truck to the test. Many of them use
their big trucks to haul big loads, trailers,
or boats.
Toyota and its agency, Saatchi &
Saatchi, saw an opportunity to match this
audience with their media objective of
connecting in-market truck buyers with
credible, objective content about their
cars. They did it by creating a unique
partnership with HowStuffWorks.com
(HSW). HSW is true to its name: it ex-
plains how everything works. Just put in
your subject and it will give you a de-
tailed description of its inner workings.
HSW does it so well that they are able to
rely on organic search to get to their au-
dience, and their content consistently
ends up in the top 10 search results.
Toyota’s agreement with HSW was a
comprehensive package. There were the
usual display ads tied to relevant content.
For example, when someone typed in
“How to Tow a Boat,” HSW would give the
answer while displaying an ad about
Tundra’s powerful, high-torque engine.
There were 131 towing-related categories
alone! If “How to Brake While Towing” was
typed, the ad would be about the truck’s
huge rotors, which gave better braking
performance. In addition, HSW created
over 100 pieces of specific Toyota-branded
content per month for articles relating to
Tundra, as well as Toyota’s Prius and Venza.
By tapping into a tight community
with relevant, targeted advertising and
content, Toyota was able to garner terrific
online metrics and improve its image.
CHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 395
Trade associations, such as those serving realtors, have developed innovative services for
their members that make it easy to use online marketing. Local realtors, for example, can sign up
forRealtor.com,which not only carries online listings, but also provides templates for packaging
properties in attractive and accessible formats. The reason realtors value such services is because
they realize that more than 80 percent of real estate buyers start their searches on the Internet. Ed
Burd, who received the Real Estate Online Marketing Award of Excellence from Realtor.com,has
found that “print is out of date and there’s less response to traditional advertising.” He likes the
online service because he can provide quick responses to prospects and he gets data tracking in-
formation back from the online service.8
The Internet as a Marcom Medium
Online marketing communication (marcom) serves five primary purposes. First, it provides a
brand reminder message to people who are visiting a website. Second, it works like an ad in tra-
ditional media and delivers an informational or persuasive message. The third purpose, however,
is critical: it provides a way to entice people to visit the advertiser’s website by clicking on a ban-
ner or button that links to the website. This is called “driving traffic to the website.”
The most important roles from a customer-focus perspective, however, are search and inter-
activity. These are unique to Internet marketing communication. Search tools, such as Google and
Microsoft’s Bing.com,enable customers to find brands, customer reviews, and other product in-
formation. Interactivity makes it possible for consumers to move away from being a “target” and
initiate contact with a company or with other customers and have a conversation about a brand.
Early Internet marketing communication sites were either websites providing general infor-
mation about a company and its brands or an online version of the company’s catalog. More re-
cently Internet marketers have begun to move beyond the catalog mentality and are using links,
animation, and other technology to bring their products to life. Diego Contreras, art director at
Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky, describes how important online communication has become in his The
Inside Story.(CP(cid:2)B, incidentally was named Interactive Agency of the Year at the 2010 Cannes
Festival.)
Fashion sites, such as Stylecaster, ShopFlick, Smashing Darling, and Saks, use videos, links
to other designers, and wand-based functions that allow visitors to view fashion items from all
sides—even the insides of handbags. MyShape.comasks customers to type in body measurements
and then acts like a personal shopper presenting fashion items specifically chosen to enhance the
customer’s body shape.
Internet branding is different in some ways from other forms of brand marketing communi-
cation. As Web consultant John Williams explains, “The Internet is an interactive channel—one
that marries text, movement, sound and design to produce a comprehensive brand personality.”
He says that this new communication environment is both an opportunity and a challenge be-
cause, even though you can create an animated brand presence, “visitors remain completely in
charge and competitors are just a click away.”9
What Are the Functions of Internet Marcom?
Marketers and advertisers are most interested in the e-business or e-commerce function of the
Internet. These terms refer to all of the hardware, software, and computer know-how that provides
a platform for businesses that use the Internet to sell products and manage their business opera-
tions, such as advertising, customer service, personal sales, internal communication to employ-
ees, and external communication to outside stakeholders. In addition to the e-commerce role,
other Internet functions that are important to advertisers include the information, entertainment,
social, and the word-of-mouth, or dialogue, roles.
The Information Role The most important advertising-related role that the Internet plays is to

over the Internet. The site ezinearticles.com only uses reader-generated content, which offers
everyone the opportunity to write magazine-quality articles and publish them online. If not obvi-
ously commercial, the site is also an outlet for business-related articles. Many zines are aimed at
niche markets. The Root, for example, is an online magazine that provides news and culture from
a black perspective. You can find it at www.theroot.com, and also check out the advertiser that
supports this site.
Online encyclopedias, such as Wikipedia, are another huge source of information. Wikipedia
publishes contributions from anyone who wants to write and edit entries in a collaborative, open-
source system of information collection. The fifth most popular website in the world, it has approx-
imately 325 million visitors a month and 3 million contributors who write and edit the content in
10 languages. The site is so popular that it has spun off a number of other specialized sites that are
advertising supported, such as wikiHow, which is a how-to guide (how to cook a brisket, how to fix
a garage door opener) built on the same principles as Wikipedia. ShopWiki offers product reviews
and Wikitravel provides tourism information. So even encyclopedias are now an advertising medium.
The Entertainment Role Many users go online for entertainment, such as poker and other
games, playing the stock market, and keeping up with fashion, music, and videos. Some of these
CHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 397
entertainment opportunities are fun, and some are personally
challenging, but they all engage their users either as escape
or relaxation, and that also makes them a useful medium in
which to advertise because the messages can be associated
with positive experiences.
Computer games and video games are, of course, the
epitome of digital entertainment. One of the first computer
games, Pac-Man, was developed in 1980 by Namco and re-
leased for Atari in 1982. Adapted from its arcade game, the
movement of the little round yellow icon, which traveled
through a maze gobbling up cookies, was controlled by a
joystick. Four ghosts impeded his progress and when he en-
countered one directly he lost his “life” and was reanimated
back at the center of the maze to start his quest all over again.
You might be interested to know that Pac-Man had a spin-off
breakfast cereal. Here’s another piece of advertising trivia, in
1983 at age 8 Christian Bale (Dark Knight) acted in a Pac-
Man cereal commercial. You can watch this classic 1980s

clude Heavy.com, which attracts viewers to its mix of racy,

actual shows downloaded from TV.
The Social Role We mentioned brand communities in Chapter 5referring to groups of people
who are connected by a favorite brand, such as the Harley-Davidson HOG (Harley Owners
Group) fan club which you can check out at the Hog website (www.harley-davidson.com/
wcm/Content/Pages/HOG/HOG.jsp). The Internet has created large numbers of virtual commu-
nitieswhere customers and prospects hang out and discuss brand problems, solutions, and new
uses among themselves. Such websites, such as the one featured here for the Smart Car, create
opportunities for real-time research into consumer insights and feelings. Many of these sites are
not run by companies, but rather by fans, who feel free to express themselves openly. There are
also company-sponsored sites that are often controlled and sometimes have rules that limit what
can be discussed. The sites that are the most successful are the ones that encourage interaction
and networking.10
Anew category of websites that focus on social networkingallows users to express them-
selves, interact with friends, and publish their own content on the Internet. Facebook, MySpace,
and Twitter, which you probably know well, are sites that allow users to share personal informa-
tion with friends. Like the old mall and arcade hangouts, these are places where teens spend hours
talking to friends about their joys, crushes, and disappointments.
Hairong Li, a Michigan State professor and contributor to this book, explains that certain
characteristics of social media—personal content, user engagement, social relationships, and
group dynamics—differentiate social media from conventional mass media. The social engage-
ment helps individuals, particularly young people, develop a sense of self. Li explains that “shar-
ing experience with others is integral to how we construct a coherent yet often fragmented sense
of self in a networked society.”
The reason these social networking sites are so attractive to marketers is that they engage the
power of friendship-based influence. Because of these relationships, network members are more

inghercomment?
These social media relationships offer opportunities for marketing communication mes-
sages, particularly as people serve as viral marketing agents to take advantage of the social rela-
tionships these people have with their network of friends. Professor Li points out that “you may
have already seen some movie trailers and album posters on the pages of your friends. These trail-
ers and posters actually represent one of the newest forms of advertising—user-generated ads.
By user-generated ads, we mean the content of commercial nature that is created or posted on the
pages of users in social media that promotes a product, service, or cause.”
The Word-of-Mouth Role In addition to providing information and associating themselves with
entertainment and social networking, advertisers are turning to the Internet because it opens up
the possibility of two-way communication, as in conversations. This characteristic supports two
basic objectives that drive advertisers’use of the Internet: (1) it creates a dialogue with customers
and (2) it stimulates a conversation among and between customers and potential customers.
The first objective relates to the interactivity dimension of the Internet. Remember from

experience. The second objective relates to the power of word-of-mouth communication. Advertising
planners have developed a growing respect for media that generate buzz or word of mouth. The
idea is to get people talking about a brand because we have recognized that the most important
factor in consumer decision making is often the opinions of others, such as family and friends.
An annual study of media use by the BIGresearch firm, which polled 15,000 consumers, found
CHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 399
that the most influential form of media is word of mouth (WoM). The finding was supported by
other research that has found WoM to be the most important influence on consumer decision
making—considerably more important than traditional media.11
Ty Montague, former chief creative officer at JWT, points to his agency’s work for JetBlue
as a brand built almost entirely on word of mouth. He explains that the airline’s advertising “is
designed to provide as many ways as possible for fans of the brand to spread the word themselves,
from stuff like a high-tech booth where they can literally create their own testimonials, which get
run on TV, to things as simple and high touch as prepaid postcards in seat back pockets that they
can use to share their experiences.”12
Japanese marketing communication giant, Dentsu, expresses this idea in its B2C2C concept.

all of the new digital media, experts point out that digital marketers can learn a lot from offline
word-of-mouth campaigns. The vice president of social media at the Razorfish agency, for ex-
ample, looks offline to better understand “how the relationship between marketer and influencer
is developed and how their influence is measured.”13
TYPES OF ONLINE MARKETING COMMUNICATION
What kinds of Internet communication are available today to marketers? The industry is moving
so quickly that by the time you read this passage, other categories may replace or supplement
those we discuss here. Essentially, Internet advertising can be delivered as a traditional ad, just
like those you see in a magazine, or it can be presented in a number of other formats such as banner
ads, e-mail, brand blogs, and social sites, among other forms.
Websites
You’re probably familiar with these terms, but let’s review how the Internet is shaping up for
marketers. Sometimes called a home page,a company’s websiteis the online face it presents
to the public. The website is a communication tool that blurs the distinction between market-
ing communication forms, such as advertising, direct marketing, and public relations. In some
cases it looks like an online corporate brochure, or it may function as an online catalog. The
website can also be an information resource with a searchable library of stories and data about
products, product categories, and related topics. It may even deliver sales. In all cases, how-
ever, a critical function of a website is to create a brand or organizational identity and reinforce
the brand position.
TheGuitar Hero:Smash Hitswebsite, which we introduced in Chapter 11, is a good exam-
ple. You heard earlier from Diego Contreras, interactive art director at Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky,
on how he approaches design for online media. We also used some of his Guitar Hero:Smash Hits
banners in Chapter 11. Let’s continue that discussion with comments from him on how he devel-
oped the Smash Hitswebsite. He explained that Activision had a very small budget for this cam-
paign so they decided to focus their spending online. Here’s how the website idea developed
according to Contreras:
At first they wanted us to create a widget or application on their website to slowly reveal
the songs that would be featured in the game. We decided to take it further by creating a
website from scratch and promoting it with banner ads all over the Web. To add credibility
and a bit of a fun factor, we named the campaign the 2009 Guitar Hero Smash Hits Music
Awards.
To see how Web marketing communication agencies promote themselves and establish their
own brand identity, check out the Minnesota-based Risdall Advertising website (www.risdall.net).

chocolaty or cheesy, as well as standard menu categories. The site also has a seven-day meal plan-
ning tool, and a section about recipe substitutions and healthy alternatives.
The VW “Truth & Dare” website for its Jetta TDI diesel models (http://tdi.vw.com) uses
video clips and interactive tools to debunk myths about diesel, such as diesel is dirty or diesel cars
don’t start in the cold. In “diesel decaf,” for example, testers place coffee filters on the exhaust
pipes of various cars and then make coffee using them. Of course, the VWdiesel filter is so clean
there is no residue in the coffee. The site also features a blog forum and tools to compare the VW
TDI brands against competitors, such as a Savings Calculator, which compares fuel efficiency and
carbon emissions.15(To see the “coffee filter” test, check http://green.autoblog.com/2009/05/04/
vw-launches-tdi-truth-and-dare-with-coffee-filter-test.)
Some people may find a marketer’s website after doing a search using a search engine; oth-
ers may come across the website address in some other communication, such as an ad or brochure.
But another way is to encounter a link on a related site usually in the form of an ad with enough
impact to entice the visitor to leave the original site and move to this new one. Internet strategists
are keenly aware of the difficulty of enticing people to websites.
Like ads, sometimes websites have problems, as Sears found out when a Sears product page
carried a product description that proclaimed “Grills to Cook Babies.” The problem was that the
Sears website was open to editing by anyone who wanted to mess with it. Check out the story on
http://consumerist.com/2009/08/sears-caught-selling-grills-to-cook-babies-thanks-to-poorly-built-

delete the post, the effort blew up and created a hornet’s nest of negative publicity for Sears.

We briefly mentioned viral marketing in an earlier chapter, but it’s important to note this
e-mail social practice here. Designed to deliver a groundswell of opinion, buzz, or marketplace
demand for a product, viral marketinguses e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter to circulate a message
among family and friends. Depending on public interest in the topic, this practice can distribute
a message to an ever-widening network and messages can flash across the Internet like wildfire.
Remember “The Diet Coke/Mentos Experiment” that resulted in a geyser of e-mails that ex-
ploded again and again on the Internet? That viral advertising was watched by millions, and guess
what? Other viewers concocted their own versions and uploaded them on YouTube. Mentos mint
sales rose 15 percent. Was that entertainment, or advertising and is its impact on the brand posi-
tive or negative? Check out the YouTube version of this story at www.youtube.com/watch?v(cid:4)

Why Is Internet Advertising Growing So Fast?
What makes Internet advertising so exciting and attractive to marketers is that it combines the
best aspects of traditional media. You will recall that the major benefit of TVadvertising is mo-
tion, the benefit of direct response is interactivity, and one of the major benefits of print is its depth
of information. An Internet ad provides all of these benefits, and often, at a much lower cost than
traditional media.
Although the percentage of most marketing communication budgets spent on Internet ad-
vertising is still relatively small, it is growing fast. In 2009, for example, the United Kingdom be-
came the first major economy in which marketers spent more on Internet ads than they did on
traditional TVadvertising.17In the United States analysts announced in 2010 that total U.S. dig-
ital advertising was about to surpass print—a major tipping point in the ascendancy of the Inter-
net over more traditional advertising media.18
Most forms of online advertising weathered the recent recession better than most other forms
of traditional advertising.19In fact, media research company ZenithOptimedia reports that the In-
ternet was the only medium to actually attract higher ad expenditures in 2009. The report also pre-
dicts that by 2011, Internet advertising will increase from 10.5 percent of all ad expenditures to
15.1 percent.20
The greatest percentage of Internet advertising is found on a small group of large, estab-
lished sites that operate as electronic publishers, such as www.nytimes.com, www.WSJ.com,
and www.ESPN.com, as well as on major search engines and service providers, such as
Google, AOL, and Yahoo!. These media and search organizations have established reputa-
tions, and they know how to sell advertising, so they have been pioneers in the development
of Internet advertising.
Even though Internet advertising was less affected by the recession, AOLand Yahoo! suf-
fered from increased competition and both have been trying to rebuild their businesses by exper-
imenting with new models of online content and advertising sales. AOL, for example, is using
massive amounts of tracking data to tell what Web search topics are most likely to attract audi-
ences. The system can also predict interest in news stories, which will give direction to its online
newsroom. Its new ad model also allows advertisers to partner with AOLcreative teams on con-
tent development, either articles or videos. AOLand its partners may even mass produce digital
content including “advertorials,” which are paid articles by advertisers.21
One area that is struggling to figure out its Internet advertising policies is pharmaceuticals.
Heavily advertised—and regulated—in traditional media, drug manufacturers are unclear about
what the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s policies are for online advertising. Even though
huge numbers of consumers search the Internet for health information, the pharmaceutical com-
panies have been slow to advertise online because they are not sure what the disclosure require-
ments might be for this new medium.22
When you slice the online advertising pie, advertising on search engines and on the sites they
deliver gets the biggest piece at 47 percent, followed by display advertising at 35 percent. Class-
ified advertising gets 10 percent, referrals and lead generation ads 7 percent, and e-mail adver-
tising only 1 percent.23
402 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
Banner and Display Ads Small ads on other Web
pages that lure visitors to switch pages are called
banner ads.Visitors can click on them to move to the
advertised website, such as the one featured here in a
series of animated banner ads for Zippo lighters. Ban-
ner ads are easy to create and are usually placed on a
website featuring complementary products or related
topics.
Although banner ads were very popular when
they first appeared and continue to be a major part of
online advertising, the overall click-through rate has
dropped to less than 1 percent. The most successful
banner ads achieve 5 to 7 percent click-through and
can help build brand awareness even if they don’t de-
liver a high level of response.
The difference in click-through response lies in
the creativity and attention-getting power of the ban-
ner ad and where it is placed. The more related and rel-
evant a site is to the brand, the more likely it will

seen as intrusive and annoying, so some Internet advertisers have moved away from this for-
mat and some computer software programs block them.
• Micro-sitesormini-sitesare small websites that are the offspring of a parent website, such
as the TDI Diesel site on the corporate VWsite. For marketing purposes, the micro-site may
cover particular products, campaigns, events, or promotions. Micro-sites tend to be more
tightly focused than their parent sites and may be transitory because the reason for the site
might have a time frame and expire. Another variation allows advertisers to market their
products on other branded websites without sending people away from the site they’re visit-
ing. General Motors, for example, has used a mini-site on the Shell Oil site, which the
viewer can access and enlarge later. This type of advertising generally gets a higher click
rate than banners or display ads; the portal About.comestimates that 5 percent of the people
who see the sites click on them.
• Superstitialsare thought of as the “Internet’s commercial” and are designed to work like
TVads. When you go from one page on a website to another, a 20-second animation appears
in a window.
• Widgetsare tiny computer programs that allow people to create and insert professional-
looking content into their personal websites and also onto their TVscreens. They include
news notes, calculators, weather feeds, stock tickers, clocks, book or music covers, or other
Web gadgets that can be a brand name promotional offer. It’s a way to get a nonintrusive
brand reminder ad on the desktop, website, or blog. Widgets also refer to mini-applications
that pull content from some other place on the Web and add it to your site. In addition to get-
ting onto cell phone screens and social media pages, they also can monitor contacts when
someone clicks on the feature. Most recently Yahoo! has created TVwidgets that allow ac-
cess to content from new TVs by pushing a remote control button. The founder of
Widgetbox.comclassifies widgets as (1) self-expression tools (photos, clips, games), (2) rev-

enue generators on blogs (eBay categories, favorite DVDs or CDs from Amazon.com), and
(3) site-enhancement devices (news updates, discussion forums). Afourth type is a market-
ing communication message.
As advertisers have searched for more effective ways to motivate site visitors to stay longer,
they have used animation to become more entertaining with games and contests, interviews with
celebrities, even musical performances. Originally Internet ads were jazzed up using relatively
simple animation techniques to make elements move. New technologies—including plug-ins,
Java script, Flash, Silverlight, and media streaming, both video and audio—provide even more
active components. Research generally finds that the click-through rate nearly doubles when
motion and an interactive element are added to a banner ad.

to different delivery systems. Arecent study led by the giant Paris-based agency Publicis with
Microsoft, Yahoo!, CBS, and Hulu, the website portal for streaming TVprogramming, as part-
ners, tested a number of these formats and concluded that the best way to deliver video ads is
through an ad selector,a feature that offers a group of ads and invites viewers to choose one. The
test found that consumers are more likely to watch and remember video ads if they are able to
pick the ones they watch.25

up a link between his or her brand and a keyword or key terms, such as “chocolate éclairs” or
“real estate staging.” It’s the ultimate in brand linkage and association.
Search providers, such as Google, MSN, and Yahoo!, auction off positions that let advertis-
ers’ads be seen next to specific search results. This has brought a fountain of money to Google
over the years. These related ads are priced based on the number of consumer clicks on the ad,
with rates averaging around 50 cents per click. To explore how this works, “google” the term

marketing campaigns. Microsoft’s Bing.comand Google’s “Goggles” also offer visual searches
that display search results as pictures, rather than words. You can search for pink tennis shoes or
titanium tennis rackets and get a response in pictures.
Because consumers initiate the search, the adjoining ads are not perceived to be as intrusive
as other forms of advertising. People do hundreds of millions of searches a day, and businesses
spend billions to have their ads displayed next to the results. A benefit of online consumer
searches is that they leave a trail of clues about products, features, and advertising approaches.
This behavior can be mined for insights that lead to new products.
404 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
Arecent development is Google’s foray into real-time search,which not only produces the
usual search results, but also lets Google supplement the results with updates posted each second
on social media, such as Facebook and Twitter.27This mix of search and social media will only
increase the speed with which brand messages spread and will challenge the ability of companies
to monitor their brands’online presence.
Search optimization is the practice of maximizing the link between topics and brand-
related websites. Companies try to affect their search engine rankings in order to drive more traf-
fic to their websites. They want their ads to appear as close to the top of the list as possible in
order to have maximum visibility. An important first step for marketers in creating a viable web-
site is getting it registered with popular search engines so that it shows up early on the list pro-
vided by the search engine.
Classified Ads A small part of the online advertising piece, classified advertising, whether
through local media websites or Craigslist, is still used by local advertisers and organizations.
Previously the golden goose for local newspapers, the move to online “want ads” has been a big
reason why local newspapers are in trouble financially. Craigslist is a community exchange for
people who either want to sell something or are looking for something. Its business model is to
operate as a public service. It doesn’t accept advertising but does charge for real estate listings
and open-job postings.
Craigslist does have a problem with spammers who have automated the mass posting of ads,
which has caused grief for customers and led to lawsuits by Craigslist. The company is also su-
ing a San Francisco company that runs a look-alike, “parasite” site called Craigsup. Other legal
issues focus on its adult category, which carries explicit sexual-service ads.28
Internet Ad Sales The market for online display ads was estimated at $21 billion a year in 2009.
Google has been the most successful at attracting advertising, even during the recession, although
Yahoo! draws more traffic.29Google also dominates the search ad industry and sells display ads,
along with search ads, for thousands of sites.
Selling online advertising space is complicated. Major sites, such as MSNB.com and
History.com, sell ads on their pages charging premium prices because they are on high-traffic
sites. They can cost from $10 to $50 per thousand viewings depending on the visibility of the
position.30Advertisers and their media buyers get access to Internet sites through providers such
as DoubleClick, an Internet advertising service
owned by Google, that places more than 60 bil-
lion online ads per month. DoubleClick pro-
vides reports on the placement and performance
of these ads to both publishers and advertisers
and also helps create ads and widgets.
Middlemen companies act as brokers for
online ad space that they aggregate across dif-
ferent sites and package as single buys, in
effect setting up an ad network. These ad net-
workers offer less well designed sites and posi-
tions and may sell space for less than a dollar
per thousand viewers. They are criticized for
flooding the Internet with cheap and some-
times tacky ads. Data-mining companies like
Blue Kai and eXelate Media collect data on
how visitors move around among sites and
then sell access to advertising on groups of
sites that attract similar visitors. This is similar
to how local newspaper advertising can be pur-
chased through group contracts and makes
buying much more efficient.31
This is a button on the DoubleClick website that lets advertisers create
animated widget ads. If you were working for your local campus Google, Microsoft, and AOLhave gotten

on available ad space on large groups of websites. In effect,
they are cutting out the middlemen. Other big websites, such
as ESPN, Turner Broadcasting, and Forbes magazine, have
stopped doing business with the ad networks in order to gain
better control over the quality of the content on their sites.
The Online Publishers Association, which represents major
publishers of Web content, reported on a study that found
that ads on portals, as well as ads bought from ad brokers,
were significantly less effective than the ads that the pre-
mium sites offer. The idea is that the portals and ad net-
workers’ads may be cheaper but they appear in formats that
are less interesting and thus are less likely to connect with
visitors.32
Social Media Tools Online games engage potential customers with the brand

social networks (Facebook, Twitter), and online communi-
ties (sports and celebrity fans, brand communities) to build
relationships with customers. For example, for the launch of its 2010 GTI Hatchback, for ex-
ample, Volkswagen created a racing game using iPhones and iPod Touch to win a car. Players
could send messages on Twitter and post videos of their games on YouTube.

word-of-mouth advertising on steroids.
An example comes from the video game discussion of the Guitar Hero:Smash Hitswebsite
and banners by art director Diego Contreras in Chapter 11. That promotion was also supported by
a “Facebook Connect” function. Here’s how Contreras explained this idea:
Facebook Connect is a reflection of recent Web 2.0 technology and social media trends. It
basically allows you to log in to Facebook through the Smash Hits site and voice your
thoughts/comments about the site or “trash-talk” others on the comment section. Your
comments would also be posted on your Facebook Wall, as well as all of your voting re-
sults. So, say I voted for Bon Jovi for Song of the Year, it would show up on my Facebook
Wall with a link for my friends to vote for their favorite songs and post them to their pro-
files too.
In the A Matter of Principlefeature, David Rittenhouse, who is a media director at Ogilvy’s
online agency, explains his view of this rapidly growing and changing media environment and
the principle of homophilythat drives online communities and digital associations.
Asocial media campaign for the Ford Fiesta relaunch invited 100 people, who had been
thoroughly vetted by the Fiesta team, to take control of the brand’s online message. The Fiesta’s
manager of brand content calls it courageous and explains, “We had to be credible and stay out
of the mix, and that was a tough thing for all of us to do. But by screening all of these people we
knew they were going to tell effective and fun stories.”33
We mentioned that interactivity is one of, if not the, greatest advantage of online market-
ing communication. It makes conversations possible and brand-related conversations tend to
show up in blogs and chat rooms. In this section on social media, we’ll discus blogs, social net-
works, video and image-sharing sites, and social games and virtual communities.

for a generally anonymous audience. Some were interested in making money and others were into
news or politics. These personal publishing sites also contained links to related sites the bloggers
consider relevant. Although these sound like one-way communication tools, most blogs also in-
vite comments that are shared with other readers stimulating conversations, if not debates, among
them. Bloggers often have higher levels of credibility than ads or corporate websites, which are
seen as self-serving.
Corporations also use blogs in addition to their traditional websites to engage stakeholders
of all kinds. Corporate blogs are a way to keep employees and other stakeholders informed, but
employees may also be encouraged to have personal blogs. Microsoft has several hundred staffers
blogging on personal sites. Sales staffs have found that blogs are changing the sales process by
making more experiences with a product available to prospects and keeping customers current
with fast-changing technological trends. Small businesses can get help creating blogs—and
websites—from software that can be downloaded from WordPress.org.
The problem with blogs is that they take a lot of time and many bloggers run out of steam.
Asurvey by a blogger search engine, Technorati, reports that of the 133 million blogs they track,
95 percent are essentially abandoned. Mostly they died because of a lack of reader interest—or
of the marketing needed to build them an online presence. Technorati estimates that there are
some 7 to 10 million active blogs but probably between 50,000 to 100,000 generate most of the
page views.34Other bloggers have moved over to social media. Astudy has found that bloggers
are getting older as younger users have moved to Twitter.35
CHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 407
Another problem with blogs is that they are sometimes
criticized as “stealth advertisers.” Paid posts, where blog-
gers plug a product in return for cash or freebies from the
company, have caught the attention of the FTC. On a blog
for parents, for example, the blogger operator promoted a
$135 embroidered baby carrier. The blogger admits the
company sent the carrier free. These endorsements are now
being addressed by new advertising guidelines that require
bloggers to post “clear and conspicuous” disclosures that
they have received compensation or freebies.36
The concept of a blog with diary and essay postings was
reinvented in miniature by Twitter, which permits posts no
longer than 140 characters. Called tweets, these mini-posts
invite users to share their daily doings and immediate
thoughts with people who have subscribed, called followers,
to the micro-blog.Generally the followers are people known
to the Tweeter, although in the case of fans, they may ap-
proach the size and scale of a large mass audience. Actor
Ashton Kutcher, for example, became the first to collect
1 million followers on Twitter narrowly beating CNN’s
breaking-news feed in a widely publicized race.37
Advertising messages also can appear on Twitter as part
of a user’s stream of messages. As Professor Tom Mueller
points out, advertising creatives have always known that
short, succinct messages are better, but Twitter forces mar-
com messages into the tiny format of 140 characters.38
Agrowing group of Tweeters have signed up to allow
advertisers to send commercial messages under their name.
Sometimes the ads are testimonials embedded in a person’s
regular stream of Tweets (for example, where to go to find

Groups of people with a special interest can contact one another and exchange their opin-
ions and experiences through chat rooms,which are sites located online, sometimes as part of an
organization’s website, but sometimes completely independent of any company. For example, nu-
merous chat rooms are organized around various computer systems (Linux, Apple, ThinkPad,
Sega) and topics (one-to-one marketing, guerilla marketing, virtual marketing). The communica-
tion is so fast that announcements, rumors, and criticisms can circulate worldwide within a mat-
ter of minutes. Chat rooms also are good information sources about customer experiences as well
as competitors’offerings.
Social Networks The idea of an online community is the metaphor for social media sites, such
as Facebook, MySpace, and other private or brand-related sites. Social networks link friends,
fans, or others who share interest in some topic. But mostly, they are about friends. That’s why
on Facebook, when you are invited to connect with someone, you are asked to “friend” them.
Users can create posts on their own Facebook site but they can also post them on their friends
“walls,” as well as to other content sites.

According to BIGresearch, social media users tend to be younger and female;42however,
social media have seen the greatest growth in the over-35 market. Forrester Research estimates
that four in five online adult users in the United States are involved with social media at least once
a month.43And new professionally focused interactive sites, such as LinkedIn, are specifically de-
signed to serve the business community.
How are social media involved in marketing communication? Facebook accepts ads and has
a section on its site about how to create Facebook advertising (www.facebook.com/advertising),
as well as techniques to optimize your ads and track their performance. On Facebook advertisers
can either pay per click (CPC) or per thousand impressions (CPM).
Companies and brands now have Facebook and MySpace pages with their own brand pro-
files just like any other member. Facebook fan pages for brands engage consumers who have
questions or who are loyal users. P&G, which has set up an office in Silicon Valley to develop so-
cial networking sites for its many brands, says that the Pringles fan page has more than 2.8 mil-
lion global fans.44Facebook marketers hope to make friends with interested consumers who visit
their sites. These advertisers use video clips, quizzes, downloadable gifts like ring tones and
icons, and, of course, links to their own websites. For example, eBay has a special “Student Su-
perstore” page on Facebook called Half.com, a discount e-commerce site. Brand personalities,
such as the Geico Gecko, are particularly useful as a featured character on Facebook. Check out
his page at www.facebook.com/pages/The-Geico-Gecko/167996161475.Off-the-Wall, new soft-
ware by Resource Interactive, makes it possible for companies to sell directly from their Face-
book walls, which moves social media into a new dimension of social marketing.
H&R Block reached into the online tax filing space with a campaign that used a Facebook
page, as well as a dedicated digital TVspot, blogs, a YouTube channel, apps, and widgets. An
army of 1,000 Tweeters will respond to the “Ask a Tax Advisor” buttons on the Block website,
as well as answer questions directly and “listen” in on topics being discussed on community
forums. Realizing the growing importance of online services, the company hopes to maintain its
presence with digital filers, as well as support its stores and encourage filers to consult with its
staff of professional tax experts both online and in stores. The H&R Block campaign takes on
do-it-yourself competitor Intuit’s Turbo Tax, which has a long-standing, devoted online com-
munity of users.45
Politicians, who have been active users of websites, are also creating MySpace and Face-
book profiles with cool and funny things about themselves. Sarah Palin launched her
post–Governor of Alaska career from her Facebook page. It is all about connecting on a semi-
personal level with a group of like-minded individuals to attract votes, volunteers, and donations.
In terms of marketing communication applications, most of these social media forms also
can be set up by organizations to engage stakeholders in brand conversations (employee blogs,
for example, or corporate Facebook pages) or, if outside the organization, consulted for buzz,
trends, and feedback about brand perceptions. The point is that social media marketing can in-
crease a brand’s Web presence and help manage its Internet image.
Video and Image Sharing One particular type of social media is the community sites where
users can post videos (YouTube, Google Video) and photographs (Flickr). YouTube is the Goliath
of this genre with all kinds of videos from home shots of babies to parody commercials and brand-
sponsored films. Launched in December 2005, the video-sharing service plays more than 100 mil-
lionclips per day with some 65,000 clips uploaded daily. Visible Measures, which is a research
firm that tracks video viewing on YouTube and other video-sharing sites, found that Susan
Boyle’s version of “Cry Me a River” accumulated a record-breaking 100 million views after her
performance on the Britain’s Got Talentshow.46

keting that speaks to the under-25 set, experts say that reaching 1 million YouTube viewers is the
“magic number.” That’s generally thought to be the level that generates buzz and delivers significant
impressions to create a market response. Some brands and agencies even encourage mock ads cob-
bled together from clips and amateur video because they are, in some cases, highly creative.

Social Games and Virtual Communities It started with Second Lifein 2003. That is the idea that
a 3-D virtual world could become a playground for people who wanted to live imaginary lives on-
line by playing social games.Sort of a parallel universe, participants created their own avatars
who were fantasy images of themselves—some even got married and set up housekeeping with
another person’s avatar. Second Lifeeven has a commercial side with its own currency that you use

that serve the residents. Interest in Second Lifepeaked in 2007 when some 4 million people joined,
but it still continues with about a million people a month logging on. Second Lifeis popular enough
that some 1,400 companies and organizations, including IBM, still participate.47
In 2009 the action turned to FarmVille, a social game played on Facebook. It’s like a computer
game but rather than playing alone, you’re playing with friends. The idea is to grow crops either
through hard work or by buying farmcash by trading and selling crops, exchanging gifts, and ac-
cruing capital to expand your farm. The site makes money from ads and virtual goods that people
buy (with real money). Athird source of income is product come-ons, which are offers like those on
website ads, except that if you click on them, you are agreeing to try some product or service.
Social Media Strategies Marketers are experimenting to find the best ways to use social media
and take advantage of the strengths of these new media forms. Marketers who want to use social
media see value in conversations and customer relationship-building communication, rather than
targeting and promoting to a mass of anonymous consumers.
For example, Coca-Cola undertook an “Expedition 206” campaign in which the soft-drink
maker sent three 20-somethings to the 206 countries where Coke is sold. The 275,000-mile
journey is documented on its own website (www.Expedition206.com), as well as through posts
on Facebook and Twitter (@x206), with image and video sharing on Flickr and YouTube. Fans
following the journey can send in suggestions for what the trio should do or see in the various
countries. Coke will track media impressions created by the undertaking, as well as posts by
Facebook and Twitter followers, and website page views. One early success for the campaign
came with the internal communication and collaboration in planning between and among the
marketing, communication, and public relations teams. The event will also challenge local and
regional markets to develop their own supporting social media tools; in some cases they will
be using media that were unknown in their previous campaigns.48
Research has found that search ads combined with social media campaigns generate higher re-

Marketers who use social
media recognize the value marketing is less about being self-serving and more about serving and service. Social media are
in conversations and also about speed of response—its interaction is much more dynamic than previous media and
customer relationship- when questions are asked or complaints are posted, speedy response is essential. Marketers in
building communication. businesses where last-minute marketing and consumer decision making are important, such as ski
resorts, can benefit by providing real-time videos and photos, along with Tweets to skiers.
Understanding the notion of communities is critical. Some form spontaneously around a
topic; others already exist. Marketers can help form some communities and help people get to-
gether; in other communities they need to maintain a low profile. Abasic principle is to know the
community rules and respect that everyone is different. An interesting promotion by Fox media
used a newspaper ad to reach people who might be interested in joining FoxNation. It’s a digital
community centered on the FoxNation.comwebsite, which includes, videos, blogs, and news sto-
ries. The ad enlisted Uncle Sam, or at least his famous image and the “I Want You” pointing fin-
ger (see Chapter 4), to help promote the FoxNation.com.
The problem with social marketing is that it is changing so fast. MySpace gave way in pop-
ularity to Facebook about the same time Twitter appeared on the scene, and they all essentially
made chat rooms outdated. The social media we’ve discussed here are just a few sites in a huge
environment. Marketers who want an online presence need to keep up with new technologies and
new sites—and know how best to use them.
HOW IS INTERNET MARCOM EVOLVING?
The Internet itself is a catalyst for new thinking about how marcom can be used. New strategies
and practices have developed to extend this new world of Web-based marketing communication.
CHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 411
Offline Advertising for Websites
One of the most difficult problems facing Internet marketers is driving traffic to their sites. One way
to do this is to use offline advertising,which appears in conventional media to drive traffic to a web-
site. In the Chapter 12opening story, we explained how Aflac used a teaser ad in print media with
the headline “youdontknowquack.com” to entice readers to check out its site. Once there, readers
had a little test on common myths including one that asks about coverage of medical expenses. The
answer, of course, argued that everyone needs Aflac to cover all of those other expenses.

E-Media Developments and Applications
As we have said before, convergence is a big challenge, as well as an opportunity, for traditional
media industries where the differences between television, print, and the Internet media are blur-
ring. Just to remind you, here are some examples of these changes:
• An online version of the New York Times Sunday Stylemagazine appears as a new website
with daily articles and Web-only features.
• Esquiremagazine is experimenting with technology embedded in its print pages that can
trigger real-life video images when the page is held up to a Web camera.
• Podcasts,audio shows from the Web that can be downloaded to an MP3 player, are chang-
ing the way we listen to radio, as well as music. Walt Disney was one of the first companies
to explore the potential of podcasts for promotions when it used a series of them for Disney-

accesses websites that provide those services.53
Tagging, Hashtags, and Tag Clouds Search marketing is driven by keywords—the concept or
thing that you are searching for. In many of the social marketing formats, the posts are catego-
rized by tags. Similar to keywords, users of Twitter have created tagging, a way to track key-
words by inserting a hash symbol (#) before a word in a Tweet. In effect, you have “tagged” that
word and it becomes a category. Your note, as well as others with the same hashtag,will show

up as posts on www.hashtags.org.People tweeting about a
brand or company will tag their post with a # symbol plus
the company name. Others can follow the tag to see related
mentions about the brand or company.
Beyond Twitter mentions, tag cloudsare visual repre-
sentations of the use of keywords in searches and tags in so-
cial networking. A tag cloud creates a collage of words
associated with a certain phrase or name. The frequency of
use determines the weight or size of the associated word in
the network (or cloud) of associations. Originally popular-
ized by the photo-sharing site Flickr, tag clouds were created
from search keywords to help users find photos and videos
that had something in common. Tag clouds have been useful
in search engine optimization for Web pages. Hashtags and
tag clouds have been used by brands and their planners to an-
alyze the network of brand associations referenced on other
sites and messages. They give you a quick view of the most
talked about topics. For example, study the tag cloud for the
Phelps Group (www.thephelpsgroup.com), an IMC agency

Internet users is growing exponentially. The Internet audi-
ence is growing faster internationally than it is in the United States, particularly in developing
countries such as China and India.
Advertising and sales promotion laws differ from country to country. Differences in privacy
laws between Europe and the United States are expected to force American companies to change
the way they collect and share the consumer information they monitor and retrieve from cus-
tomers’ Web behavior. Web censoring is also a problem in certain countries with controlled
economies, such as China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam. State
control of the Internet leads to filtering of political information and suppression of criticism, as
well as limitations on marketing communication practices.54Even marketing efforts can be cen-
sored if they are judged to be undermining the local culture or religious standards.
Language is another factor. Although English is the dominant language on the Internet, some
advertisers who want to provide different websites for different countries have trouble ensuring
consistency across all sites. Another issue is exchange rates. Companies must decide whether to
offer prices in their own currency or in the local currency. For example, one Canadian shopper
reported that books on a Canadian website were cheaper than the same books on Amazon.com.In
addition, some companies make different offers available in different countries.

Issues in Internet Advertising
Two issues online advertisers continue to study are measuring Internet advertising and privacy
concerns.
CHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 413
Measurement The advantages of the Internet as a potential advertising vehicle are tremen-
dous, with rapid, near instantaneous feedback and results chief among them. Rather than wait
weeks or months to measure the success of a campaign, marketers can instead run ad tests on-
line, measure meaningful results within days, and quickly invest in the best performers with
minimal switching costs. One problem, however, is the question of what to measure—readers,
viewers, visitors, repeat visits, responses, sales? And how do such metrics equate to the reach of
other media?
Considerhits(the number of times a particular site is visited), viewers (the number of view-
ers to a site), unique visitors (the number of different viewers during a particular time period), and
page views (the number of times viewers view a page). These measures track a consumer through
a website, but they offer no insights as to motivation, nor do they tell us whether a visitor paid any
attention to the surrounding ads.
The primary method currently used to measure consumer response to Internet advertising is
click-through (the number of people who click on a banner ad). Many Internet advertisers con-
sider this measure insufficient, and a host of private research providers have emerged to expand
on that measure. For example, Denver-based Match Logic identifies for its clients what viewers
do next after not clicking on a banner ad.
Arecent problem is click fraud,which refers to clicks made either to make money for the
sponsoring site or to damage a competitor. NewCars.comfound itself under attack with a large
number of clicks coming from Bulgaria, Indonesia, and the Czech Republic. With pay-per-click,
the company had to pay a search engine every time a Web surfer clicked on its link. There’s even
a company, Click Forensics, that specializes in detecting click fraud.55
Internet Targeting and Privacy In addition to providing information, e-businesses also capture
information and use it to direct their marketing communication efforts to make messages more
personal and relevant to consumers. This is true for Internet advertising as well as e-mail adver-
tising and direct marketing, which we will discuss in Chapter 16.
Every time you order something from Amazon.com,for example, the company keeps track
and starts building a profile of your interests. When you go to Amazon the next time, the site will
probably open with an announcement about some new book or CD that might interest you. If you
have given Amazon permission, it will also send these announcements to you by e-mail. In other
words, companies that collect data about the behavior of their customers can better target them
with advertising messages and personalized special promotional offers. We referred to this ear-
lier as behavioral targeting. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) has an online campaign
that addresses the privacy issue.
But there are other tracking mechanisms, such as cookies,which are little electronic bugs,
that can be placed on your computer by a Web server to track your movements online. They don’t
do anything bad, like a virus does, but they do report back to their owners what sites you visited
and from that they build an online profile about you and your interests. On the good side, cookies
let companies store information about your preferences so you don’t have to retype everything
every time you go to that site.

used and whether its use violates their privacy. AOL, for example, assembles a huge database of cus-
tomer information, some of which it sells to other direct marketers. It admits this practice in its pri-
vacy policy, which is published on its website. It also buys information about its subscribers from
other outside database suppliers, which it can use to better target its customers’interests. And that’s
the primary reason companies collect this type of information: It lets them better target their adver-
tising messages and theoretically be more selective in how they contact customers and prospects.
Many companies try to maintain a responsible position by posting their privacy policy on
their websites, which details, among other things, how or whether the site is collecting data on its
visitors and how those data are used. Sometimes this information is easy to find, sometimes it is
buried on the site and difficult to access, and in some instances the website doesn’t have any pub-

looking into these practices and the industry is trying to head off legal action by taking steps to
make their practices more transparent. One proposal, for example, is for an icon that would ap-
pear on Web pages to let consumers know that their activity is being tracked.56 The European
Union monitors behavioral targeting practices and even started legal action against the United
Kingdom for permitting behavioral targeting without proper notification to consumers or for not
requiring opt-out mechanisms.57
Advantages and Limitations of Internet Advertising
Internet advertising is growing in popularity because it offers some distinct advantages over other
media, in addition to the explosion in its use by consumers. Most notably, it is relatively inexpensive.
Advertisers see it as a relatively low-cost alternative to mainstream advertising media. It is also a form
that reaches people who aren’t watching much television or reading newspapers. Another benefit of
Internet advertising is that it is relatively easy to track and reach a highly targeted audience.
Also, advertisers can customize and personalize their messages over the Internet. Thanks to
database marketing,an advertiser can input key demographic and behavioral variables, making
the consumer feel like the ad is just for him or her. Check out www.classmates.comfor an exam-
ple. Ads appearing on a particular page are for products that would appeal to a particular age
group. Someone who graduated from high school in 1960 would see banner ads for investments
that facilitate retirement as opposed to someone graduating in 2000 who might see career ads.
For the B2B advertiser, Internet advertising can provide excellent sales leads or actual sales.
Users of a typical B2B site, for example, can access the product catalogs, read the product spec-
ifications in depth, request a call from a salesperson, and make a purchase online.
The Internet can level the playing field for small and medium-sized companies that compete
against larger organizations. The cost of creating a website, a set of ads, and a database is afford-
able for virtually every marketer.
Undoubtedly, the most serious drawback is the inability of strategic and creative experts to
consistently produce effective ads and to measure their effectiveness. Technological limitations
can also cause problems for users with low bandwidth or a lack of computer expertise.
Consider, too, that clutter is just as much a problem with the Internet as it is in other media.
In fact, because multiple ads may appear on the same screen—many moving or popping up—the
clutter may be even worse.
Looking Ahead
This chapter has described the important developments in digital media and how online media
have changed the face of marketing communication. In particular, we’ve discussed the implica-
tions of shape-shifting media and the challenges, as well as opportunities, they create for mar-
keting communication. The next chapter pulls all of these opportunities together and describes
how media planning and buying are managed.
CHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 415
IT’S A WRAP
Mission Accomplished
The U.S. Army’s traveling Virtual Army Experience effectively reached and built relationships with potential
recruits by using media creatively and interactively. In addition to recruiting new soldiers, the VAE at-
tempted to reshape the public perceptions formed in popular culture to teach young people about the hard
work and sacrifice soldiers endure in the service to protect our country’s freedom each day.
“More than ever before, today’s audience is drawn to a brand they can interact and connect with on a
more personal level,” said Lt. Gen. Benjamin C. Freakley, commanding general of U.S. Army Accessions Com-
mand. “We want our prospects to experience the Army brand in a relevant way, so we infuse experiential op-
portunities into all of our marketing efforts. That way, our prospects can better understand what it’s really like
to be a soldier and, therefore, make an informed decision about serving our nation in the Army.” Sgt. Jason
Mike, a Silver Star recipient and one of the “Real Heroes” manning the event at Andrews Air Force Base, said,
“I hope that everyone who comes through here leaves with a greater appreciation for the Army and our men
and women in uniform.”
In the first three years of its operations, the VAE provided a glimpse of soldiering in the U.S. Army to more
than 205,000 unique visitors, and has helped identify more than 112,000 qualified prospects to the sales force.
It delivered an event cost per lead that was well below its goal. Importantly, it converted leads to U.S. Army
contracts. Of all the qualified leads generated through the VAE program, the conversion rate far exceeded the
stated goal. According to a 2008 New Recruit Survey Report published by U.S. Army Accessions Command,
the VAE became the fifth most attended Army event among new recruits. Pre-event and post-event assess-
ment surveys indicated that negative perceptions of a career in the U.S. Army were significantly dispelled as
well. According to the same 2008 survey, U.S. Army Accessions Command also reported that the VAE resulted
in the highest percentage of positive change in perception of the top Army event marketing programs.
The operation was deemed a success as a communication campaign. The U.S. Army has been decorated
with numerous awards for this project, including a Silver and Gold Effie for Brand Experience and Government/
Institution/Recruitment, respectively.

Dove Audiences Redefine Beauty
So far you’ve read a lot about effective brand communication. You’ve seen
how Burger King successfully kept its Whopper in the minds of the hungry,
how Wii became a cultural phenomenon, and how Chick-fil-A consistently
conveys its quirky “Eat Mor Chikin” message delivered by cows on billboards. As
these cases demonstrate, one of the fundamental principles of successful commu-
nication is the ability to understand how best to connect with the consumer.
Unilever’s campaign for Dove, which won a Grand Effie and Festival of Media
Award for “branding bravery,” provides another example of great advertising that
recognized a truth held by consumers and then connected on a personal level with
those consumers. The “Campaign for Real Beauty” touched a nerve and punctured
the cultural obsession with stick-thin bodies and Barbie doll images. The Dove
campaign was risky because it sought to literally redefine beauty in advertising and
to acknowledge a change in the way women see themselves. It could have been a
bomb, but it was a winner because it spoke to every woman’s need to look and feel
her best without promising or reinforcing impossible standards of beauty.
Unilever commissioned research that eventually drove the marketing cam-
paign. Some startling statistics from the study included these findings:
• Only 2 percent of the respondents believed they were beautiful.
• Of the respondents, 68 percent indicated they strongly believed that the media
and advertising set an unrealistic standard of beauty most women can’t achieve.
Here’s how the Dove “Campaign for Real Beauty” unfolded.
Dove recognized it needed to reach every woman, and to do that it strategi-
cally placed messages in many different media. The message of the Dove “Cam-
paign for Real Beauty” provided a deliberate contrast with that of the competition
in beauty and women’s magazines like Glamour,Allure,andVogue. Heavy empha-
sis was placed on print rather than television because of print media’s ability to stop
the audience and make them really look at the models in the ad and contemplate
the meaning of beauty.
419
420 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
Dove didn’t ignore broadcast media, however—they even ran an ad during
the Super Bowl. They also established a website (campaignforrealbeauty.com),
which urges a boost in self-esteem by defying stereotypes that define beautiful as
perfect—and skinny. Part of the campaign, a Web video titled Evolution, was a vi-
ral phenomenon that reached millions.
Spending a fifth of the normal amount for a personal-care product launch, the
Dove advertising was concentrated in the top 10 cities where it would have the
most immediate impact. Outdoor and transit advertisements were plastered on
billboards and buses to generate public debate.
A similar strategy was used in 2007 to launch Dove’sProAgeline, which con-
tinues the counterintuitive strategy by celebrating older women with their silver
hair, wrinkles, and age spots. In Canada, the campaign found its voice in Finding

As Unilever knows, media planning is a problem-solving process. The problem: How can media
choices help meet the marketing and advertising objectives? The ultimate goal is to reach the tar-
get audience with the right message in the best possible way at the best possible time in the most
efficient way possible. In this chapter, we review how a media plan is developed—how media
planners set objectives and develop media strategies. We then explore the media-buying function
and explain how media buyers execute the plan.
HOW ARE MEDIA PLANS CREATED?
Media planners are in the connection business, as the Dove case illustrates. Their work connects
brand messages with customers and other stakeholders. They identify and activate the points of
contact where brand messages touch consumers. The Dove plans included traditional media, par-
ticularly print and outdoor, but also websites, Internet videos, viral marketing, a theatrical play,
and party hosting. Note that this media plan involved a lot more than advertising, which supports
the point we made in Chapter 11that all forms of marketing communication use media.
Making connections that resonate with the audience is the hallmark of effective marketing
communication, wherever that may occur. Think about the U.S. Army’s power to connect with
recruits using the video game–based experience and event you read about in Chapter 13, as well
as the emotional connections created in the Dove “Real Women” and “ProAge” campaigns. An-
other example features embedded ads in video games as described in The Inside Story feature.
Not only was this an interesting ad placement, it also generated great publicity.
We mentioned in Chapter 11that traditionally, the advertising agency’s media department
has been responsible for developing the media plan with input from the agency’s account and cre-
ative teams and the marketer’s brand management group. More recently, media-buying compa-
nies have moved into the planning stage as well, bringing the expertise of their media researchers
and negotiators. Some major agencies have spun off the media function as a separate company;
then they contract with that company for their media planning and buying services. Others have

Like political campaigns, this rapid

video games, an industry that is highly
competitive and often in the public eye
with topics ranging from mature content
and video game ratings to the unveiling
of hotly anticipated titles. Corporate
communications professionals often act
as spokespeople for timely and occasion-
ally controversial issues.
There are many lessons to be found
by working in public relations in the video
games industry, like being creative in find-
ing opportunities to drive a story when
others might shy away. It’s exciting to
work for a company like EA, and there are
a lot of opportunities for the people who
speak on behalf of it. There is never a dull

ever had.

kept the planning in house but contract with an outside media-buying service. Once the media
plan is developed, a media-buying unit or team, either in the ad agency or external in a separate
media company, executes it.
Given the industry trends, the hot media shops have specialties in new media. For example,
the long-established Ogilvy agency launched neo@Ogilvy as a digital-media group to help ad-
vertisers figure out how to allocate their ad budgets in the vast array of new media, such as on-
line video, social networking sites, and search advertising. The Inside Storyby David Rittenhouse
in Chapter 5explained how agencies such as neo@Ogilvy approach the new arena of online be-
havioral targeting.
Media Research: Information Sources
Some people believe media decisions are the hub in the advertising wheel because media costs
are often the biggest element in the marketing communication budget. Not only are media deci-
sions central to advertising planning, media research is central to media planning. That realiza-
tion stems from not only the large amount of money that’s on the line, but also the sheer volume
of data and information that media planners must gather, sort, and analyze before media planning
can begin. Figure 14.1illustrates the wide range of media information sources and the critical role
media research plays in the overall advertising planning process.

• Market ResearchIndependently gathered information about markets and product categories
is another valuable tool for media planners. Mediamark Research, Inc. (MRI), Scarborough
(local markets), and Mendelsohn (affluent markets) are research companies that provide this
service. This information is usually organized by product category (detergents, cereals,
snacks, etc.) and cross-tabulated by audience groups and their consumption patterns. Acces-
sible online for a fee, this wealth of information can be searched and compared across thou-
sands of categories, brands, and audience groups. Although the reports may seem
intimidating, they are not that difficult to use. Figure 14.2is a page from an MRI report
showing how to read MRI data. Media planners use MRI data to check which groups, based
on demographics and lifestyles, are high and low in category use, as well as where they live
and what media they use.
• Competitive Advertising ExpendituresIn highly competitive product categories, such as
packaged goods and consumer services, marketers track how much competing brands spend

on media compared to how much they are spending on their particular brand. This is called
share of voice. In other words, marketers want to know which, if any, competing brands
have louder voices (i.e., are spending more) than they do. For example, if the total spent on
airline advertising last year was $200 million, and $50 million of that was spent by United
Airlines, UA’s share of voice would be 25 percent (50 (cid:6)200(cid:4)25%). Most agencies rec-
ommend that a brand’s share of voice be at least as high as its share of market. For a new
brand, obviously its share of voice needs to be more than its share of market if it wants to
grow.

• Media Coverage AreaOne type of media-related information about markets is the broadcast
coverage area for television. Called a designated marketing area (DMA),the coverage
area is referred to by the name of the largest city in the area. This is a national market analy-
sis system, and every county in the United States has been assigned to a DMA. The assign-
ment of a county to a DMAis determined by which city provides the majority of the county
households’TVprogramming. Most DMAs include counties within a 50- to 60-mile radius
of a major city center. Even though this system is based on TVbroadcast signals, it is uni-
versally used in doing individual market planning.
• Consumer Behavior ReportsWe mentioned some of the consumer research sources in
Chapter 5that are used in developing segmentation and targeting strategies. They are also
useful in planning media strategies. For example, media planners use such services as the
Claritas PRIZM system, Nielsen’s ClusterPlus system, and supermarket scanner data to lo-
cate the target audience within media markets.
The Media Plan
Themedia planis a written document that summarizes the objectives and strategies that guide
how media dollars will be spent. The goal of a media plan is to find the most effective and effi-
cient ways to deliver messages to a targeted audience. Media plans are designed to answer the fol-
lowing questions: (1) who (target audience), (2) what for (objectives), (3) where (the media
vehicles used), (4) where (geography), (5) when (time frame), (6) how big (media weight), and
(7) at what cost (cost efficiency). The first three are media objectives and the second group rep-
resents media strategies. To see where media planning and buying fit into the overall advertising
process, see Figure 14.3, which outlines the primary components of a media plan.
When IMC planners develop a media plan, they also take into consideration contact
points. These include exposure to traditional mass media, as well as word of mouth, place-
based media, in-store brand exposures, and the new, interactive media. We’ll discuss the IMC
dimension of media planning at the end of this chapter. To help you better understand the role
of media planners, read the discussion of a week in the life of a media planner in the accom-
panying feature.
WHAT ARE THE KEY STEPS IN MEDIA PLANNING?
Media planning is more than just choosing from a long list of media options. Traditional
measured mediaare chosen based on such metrics as GRPs and CPMs, which are explained later
in this chapter, but the new media lack similar metrics and are characterized more by such con-
siderations as the quality of the brand experience, involvement, and personal impact. Old-line ad-
vertising media planners are intent on buying reach and frequency, but the problem is that many
of their clients are looking for more effective outcomes, such as engaging experiences and brand-

along with the list of media options.
The four basic steps in media planning are targeting, setting media objectives, developing
media strategies, and analyzing the metrics of a media plan.
Step 1: Target Audience
Akey strategic decision is identifying a target audience. In media planning, the challenge is to se-
lect media vehicles that (1) are compatible with the creative executions and (2) whose audiences

best match those of the brand’s target audience. In other words, does the group of people who read
this magazine, watch this television program, or see these posters include a high proportion of the
advertiser’s ideal target audience? If so, then these media vehicles may be a good choice for the
campaign, depending on other strategic factors, such as timing and cost.
Media planners, for example, are unlikely to run ads for women’s products on the Super
Bowl, which is skewed 56 percent male; instead, they buy time on the Oscars, which has a much
higher percentage of female viewers. However, in 2010 Dove used the Super Bowl to launch its

message. As you can imagine, every media vehicle’s audience is different and therefore varies re-
garding what percentage of its audience is in the brand’s target audience. For example, Mercury
Marine, which makes outboard boat motors, targets households (HHs) that own one or more
boats. It prefers to advertise in magazines where it can feature beautiful illustrations of its prod-
ucts as well as room to explain the many benefits of its motors. Should it advertise in Time or
Boatingmagazine?Timemagazine reaches 4 million HHs, of which 280,000 HHs have boats; in

comparison,Boatinghas only 200,000 HH subscribers. If you said Time,sorry, you’re not being
very cost efficient. This is because even though Timereaches 80,000 more boat-owning house-
holds, it also reaches 3.7 million HHs that don’t own boats. Mercury would have to pay to reach
all readers, even those not in its target audience. By advertising in Boating,it can pretty well as-
sume that subscribers either own a boat or at least are interested in boating.
In addition to information compiled by the team’s media researchers, consumer insight re-
search also is used to identify and analyze the target audience’s media use patterns. Industry re-
search helps. For example, in a 2009 study, Harris Interactive Research found that 37 percent of
Americans said TVads are most helpful in making a purchase decision. Newspapers (19 percent)
came in second; only 14 percent said Internet search engines were most helpful. In fact, nearly
half of the respondents said they ignored Internet banner ads.2
This type of research that asks consumers what they think influences their behavior is best
used when combined with other consumer behavior findings. Why? Because most consumers
don’t really know what influences them. (Just ask some of your friends how much advertising im-
pacts what they buy. Most will probably say that “it doesn’t” or “just a little.”)
For the launch of the Audi A3, the McKinley (cid:2) Silver media team knew it needed an in-
depth understanding of its target audience of young males to develop a media plan that would
work for this difficult-to-reach group. From research they found that young males typically don’t
read or watch traditional media. They’re busy and skeptical about commercial messages. From
these findings the team came up with a profile of the target, which they described as “intelligent,
independent, and innovative” and heavy users of new media. This target audience for this prod-
uct category is made up of opinion leaders who influence their peers. They are not as interested
in buying an entry-level car as they are in getting “what’s next.”
Step 2: Communication and Media Objectives
Although creative decisions are sometimes made before media planning, this is changing. With
the increasing variety of media options available, smart clients and agencies are having up-front
cross-functional planning meetings that include creatives, media planners, and account execu-
tives. The point is that the media and message strategies are interdependent and decisions in one
area affect decisions in the other.
Marketing communication objectives, as you will recall, describe what a company wants target
audiences to think, feel, and most importantly, do. Media objectivesdescribe what a company wants
to accomplish regarding the delivery of its brand messages and their impact on the target audience.
The communication objectives provide guidance to media planners. For example, why
would brands want to spend some $3 million to advertise on the Super Bowl unless the buy fits
with its brand communication objectives? Pepsi, a long-time Super Bowl advertiser, pulled out in
2010 deciding that expensive brand reminder ads in front of an audience that already knows the
brand don’t make sense. On the other hand, brands that are building their images, launching new
products, or who want to use messages to shape public perceptions on a mass scale—the Super
Bowl reaches some 100 million viewers—might see the investment as a good one. Two advertis-
ers during the 2010 Super Bowl illustrate reasons corporations might want to make the invest-
ment. Hyundai, for example, wants to change its image from a maker of small, cheap cars to a
upscale image and Career Builder believes its job search services are appropriately communi-
cated to a broad population as the United States comes out of a recession.3
As we mentioned in Chapter 11, the two basic media objectives are reach and frequency.
Let’s consider how planners create strategies that deliver on those objectives.
The Reach Objective The percent of people exposed to a brand message one or more times

Using demographic and lifestyle data, planners can focus on reaching specific types of house-
holds (e.g., empty nesters, homes with two(cid:2)children under age 18, single-parent households, HHs
with incomes over $100,000) or individuals (males ages 25 to 49, people who rent). This enables
planners to better match media profiles with the characteristics of the campaign’s target audience.
428 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
Because most media reach large numbers of people who are not in the target market, how-
ever, most marketers are more interested in targeted reach, which is the percentage of a vehicle’s
audience that matches the brand’s target market. An estimate of targeted reach can be developed
assuming the brand’s target market can be identified in the vehicle’s audience profile. Targeted
reach is particularly important to calculate in order to estimate the amount of wasted reach,
which is the number of people in the vehicle’s audience who are neither customers nor prospects.
We mentioned this problem in our discussion of network television, which is particularly sus-
ceptible to this criticism because of its mass audience.
Assessing the media for target audience opportunities is a major challenge for media plan-
ners. The evening news on television, for example, reaches a broad mass-market audience; if your
target is women ages 25 to 49, then you have to consider the targeted reachof that news program.
Obviously both men and women watch news, so you know that your audience would probably be
half or less of that, especially since you are targeting a specific age group. Maybe the evening
news isn’t a good option to reach this target because there would be so much waste. Outdoor, as
theCourt TVposters illustrate, are a location-bound medium and posters are particularly good at
targeting a specified population.
The Frequency Objective As we explained in Chapter 11, frequencyrefers to the repetition of
message exposure. You should keep in mind that the frequency number for a media buy is actu-
ally the average number of exposure opportunities of those reached.
Because frequency is an average,it can be misleading. The range of frequency is often large:
Some people see a particular brand message once, while others may see it 10 times within a given
period.Average frequency,then, can give the planner a distorted idea of the plan’s performance
because all of those people reached vary in the number of times they have the opportunity to be
exposed to a message.
Suppose a media mix includes four magazines and each magazine carries one ad a week for
four weeks. The total number of message insertions would be 16 (4 magazines (cid:5)1 insertion a
SHOWCASE
These two posters for the Court TVtelevision program were created by Aaron Stern when he was an
award-winning copywriter at Venables Bell & Partners in San Francisco.

now works as a freelance copywriter. He and his work were nominated for

CHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 429
week(cid:5)4 weeks (cid:4)16 total insertions). It is possible that a small percentage of the target audi-
ence could be exposed to all 16 insertions. It is also possible that some of the target would not
have the opportunity to be exposed to any of the insertions. In this case the frequency ranges from
0 to 16. Thus, because the average frequency equals 8, you can see how misleading this average
frequency number can be.
For this reason planners often use a frequency distributionmodel that shows the percent-
age of audience reached at each level of repetition. Afrequency quintile distribution analysis
divides an audience into five groups, each containing 20 percent of the audience. Employing
media-usage modeling, it is then possible to estimate the average frequency for each quintile as
shown in the following table. For example, this table shows that the bottom 20 percent has an av-
erage frequency of 1, whereas the top 20 percent has an average frequency of 10. In this hypo-
thetical distribution, the average frequency is 6.
Frequency (Average Number
Quintile of Exposure Opportunities)
Top 20% of universe 10
20% 7
20% 5
20% 3
Bottom 20% 1
If the media planner feels it is necessary that 80 percent of those reached should have an av-
erage frequency of 8, then a more intensive media plan would be needed to raise the overall num-
ber of exposures; in other words, to shift the average from 6 to 8.
Effective Frequency Because of the proliferation of information and clutter, there should be
a threshold, or minimum frequency level, that produces some type of effect, such as a request
for more brand information, a change in attitude toward the brand, or the most desired effect—
purchase of the brand.
Astandard rule of thumb is that it takes 3 to 10 exposures to have an effect on an audience.
Principle
Obviously this frequency range is extremely wide. The “right” frequency number is determined
Effective frequency means
by several factors, including level of brand awareness, level of competitive “noise,” content of you add frequency to

pact a response (i.e., an effect), audience response research is necessary. If the desired effect/ level where people
response is not achieved, you may need to increase frequency of exposure or change the message. respond.
Research diagnostics, such as tracking studies, provide direction. The principle of effective fre-
quencyis that you add frequency to reach until you get to the level where people respond.
Media Waste In the discussion of targeted reach we mentioned waste as a result of targeting too
wide of a target market. Actually, there are two sides to waste—both reach and frequency. The
goal of media planning is to maximize media efficiency, which is to eliminate excessive overlap
or too much frequency. Efficiency is achieved, therefore, by reducing media waste. Media pro-
fessionals use their own experience, as well as audience research and computer models, to iden-
tify media efficiency. The point is, when additional media weight ceases to increase the response,
it produces waste.
Writing Media Objectives Given this discussion of the relationship between reach and fre-
quency, it should be clear that usable media objectives would focus on those dimensions ideally
including both factors. Here are some examples of media objectives:
1. Reach 60 percent of target audience with a frequency of 4 within each four-week period in
which the advertising runs.
2. Reach a maximum percentage of target audience a minimum of five times within the first
six months of advertising.
3. Reach 30 percent of the target audiences where they have an opportunity to interact with
the brand and users of the brand.
4. Reach category thought leaders and influencers in a way that will motivate them to initiate
measurable word of mouth (WOM) and other positive brand messages.
430 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
The first of these objectives is the most common. It recognizes that you can seldom ever
reach 100 percent of your target audience. It also acknowledges that a certain level of frequency
will be necessary for the brand messages to been seen/heard/read. The second objective would be
for a product where the message is more complex; through research (and judgment) it has been
decided that prospects need to be exposed to the message at least five times to be effective. In this
case frequency is more important than reach. Put another way, it is more important to reach a
small portion of the audience five or more times and have them respond than it is to reach a ma-
jor portion fewer than five times and have little or no response.
Objectives 3 and 4 deal directly with impact. To achieve these objectives, media buyers will
have to find media vehicles and contact points, such as events and sponsorships, where interaction
with the brand and its users is possible as opposed to using more passive media such as traditional
mass media. Note that objective 4 is not measurable as stated.
Step 3: Media Strategies
Strategic thinking in media involves a set of decision factors and tools that help identify the best
way to deliver the brand message. Regardless of whether a company spends a few hundred dollars
on one medium or millions of dollars on a variety of media, the goal is still the same: to reach the
right people at the right time with the right message.
Media strategyis the way media planners determine the most cost-effective way to reach
the target audience and satisfy the media objectives. Specific media strategies are based on ana-
lyzing and comparing various ways to accomplish the media objectives, and then selecting the
approach that is estimated to be the most effective alternative. The idea is that there are always
multiple ways to reach an objective, but which way is the best?
Strategies That Deliver Reach and Frequency In certain situations, for example, when the ob-
jectives call for high reach, the strategies used would involve creating broad exposure using many
media vehicles. For example, high-reach strategies might be used in order to provide reminders
for a well-known brand or to introduce a new product that has a broadly defined target market.
If the objectives specify high frequency, then the media strategies will probably be narrower
in focus with a more limited list of media vehicles. That would be the case for niche products with
tightly defined target markets (low reach) or for products that need a high level of information and
explanation. High-frequency strategies are also used to counter competitive offers and to build the
brand’s share of voice in a highly cluttered category. Sometimes a low-frequency objective is spec-
ified when there is less need for repetition. If you are advertising a two-liter Coke for 89 cents, you
don’t need to repeat the message a lot, but if you are trying to explain how DVR systems work,
then you may need more frequency.
Media Mix Selection The reach and frequency objectives also lead to decisions about the me-
dia mix. We mentioned earlier that you can rarely generate an acceptable reach level with just one
media vehicle. Most brands use a variety of targeted media vehicles, called a media mix,to reach
current and potential customers. ESPN, for example, uses TV, magazines, radio, and the Internet,
as well as original programming on its own ESPN channel, to promote its programs.
Media mixes are used for a number of reasons. The first is to reach people not reached by
the first or most important medium. Using a variety of media vehicles distributes the message
more widely because different media tend to have different audience profiles. Of course, these
different audience groups should generally fit within the brand’s target market.
Some people even reject certain media: television advertising, for example, is considered in-
trusive and Internet advertising is irritating to some people. Other reasons for spreading the plan
across different media include adding exposure in less expensive media and using media that have
some attractive characteristics that enhance the creative message. On the other hand, an Ad Age
columnist believes media planners shouldn’t give up traditional media just because digital media
have become “sexy” and are seen as having lower costs.4
Still, the reason for choosing a particular medium or a set of media vehicles depends on the
media objectives. What media will best deliver what effects—and can you reinforce and extend
those effects with a mix of media? If audience reach is an objective, then television still reaches the
largest audience; if frequency is important, then radio may be the best media vehicle to use. Print
and television are considered more trustworthy, so they might be used by a media planner for a cam-

paign that seeks to establish credibil-
ity for a brand or believability for a
product claim. The Practical Tips
box summarizes the reasons media
planners choose various media.
An analysis of one industry’s
media mix choices presents an inter-
esting argument about the logic of
the media mix. The telecom industry
(AT&T, Verizon, Sprint) was cri-
tiqued by BIGresearch and a team of
media researchers from Northwest-
ern University. Based on consumer
research and a customized analytical
model, the team was able to develop
an idealized set of media alloca-
tions. In comparison to actual ex-
penditures, the team concluded that
the industry overspends on televi-
sion at the expense of others, such as
the Internet, radio, magazines, and
outdoor. In particular, the consumer-
based research determined an under-
use of the Internet based on amount
of time, its ability to influence pur-
chase, and its lower costs.5
Media choices are sometimes
designed to deliver the strategy of
using one medium to deliver an au-
dience to another medium or mar-
keting communication tool. For
example, mass media have fre-
quently been used to promote spe-
cial events and sales promotions.

broadcast, which are basically in-
formative and awareness building
media forms, are often used to drive traffic to a brand’s website, which is more interactive and
experiential. The Frontier “Web” ad is an example of this use.
Geographical Strategies Another factor planners use in analyzing the target audience is geogra-
phy. Are potential customers found all over the country, therefore calling for a national campaign,
and does the client have the budget to afford such an extensive media plan? In most cases, the me-
dia plan will identify special regions or DMAs to be emphasized with a heavy-up schedule,which
means proportionately more of the budget is spent in those areas. The company’s sales coverage
area (i.e., geography) is a major factor used to make this decision. There’s no sense advertising in
areas where the product isn’t available. Most national or regional marketers divide their market ge-
ographically. The amount of sales produced in each geographic market will vary, and marketers try
to match advertising investments with the amount of forecasted sales or the sales potential.
To determine which geographical areas have the highest (and lowest) rate of consumption
for a particular product category, marketers compute a category development index (CDI)for
each market in which they are interested. Then they calculate a brand development index (BDI),
which estimates the strength of their brand in the various geographical areas. If General Mills
were to bring out a new line of grits, for example, it wouldn’t advertise nationally because most
grits are consumed in the South.

pany data.
Different strategies are used to deal with these levels, and they have implications for the me-
dia mix and schedule. Planners typically don’t make heavy allocations in weak sales areas unless
strong marketing signals indicate significant growth potential. Conversely, strong sales markets
may not receive proportional increases in advertising unless clear evidence suggests that com-
pany sales can go much higher with greater advertising investment. When there is a lot of com-
petitive activity, a heavy-up strategy may be used to defend the brand’s market share.
Scheduling Strategies When should a potential customer be exposed to a brand message?
Scheduling strategies are designed to identify the best times for consumers to come in contact
with a brand message.
For many product categories, prospective customers have one or more ideal times or places

watch the game.
Regardless of whether a company spends a few hundred dollars on one medium or millions
of dollars on a variety of media, the goal is still the same: to reach the right people at the right time
with the right message. If advertising budgets were unlimited, most companies would advertise
every day. Not even the largest advertisers are in this position, so media planners manipulate
schedules in various ways to create the strongest possible impact given the budget. Three sched-
uling strategies involve timing, duration of exposure, and continuity of exposure.
• Timing Strategies:When to Advertise?Timing decisions relate to factors such as seasonal-
ity, holidays, days of the week, and time of day. These decisions are driven by how often the
product is bought and whether it is used more in some months than in others. Timing also
encompasses the consumers’best aperture and competitors’advertising schedules. Another
consideration is lead time,or the amount of time allowed before the beginning of the sales
period to reach people when they are just beginning to think about seasonal buying. Back-to-
school advertising is an example. Advertising typically starts in July or early August for a
434 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
school calendar that begins in late August or September. Lead time also refers to the produc-
tion time needed to get the advertisement into the medium. There is a long lead time for
magazines, but it is shorter for local media, such as newspapers and radio.
• Duration:How Long?For how many weeks or months of the year should the advertising run?
If there is a need to cover most of the weeks, advertising will be spread rather thin. If the
amount of time to cover is limited, advertising can be concentrated more heavily. Message
scheduling is driven by use cycles. For products that are consumed year-round, such as fast food
and movies, advertising is spread throughout the year. In general, if you cannot cover the whole
year, you should heavy up the schedule in higher purchase periods. For example, movie mar-
keters do most of their newspaper advertising on the weekends, when most people go to movies.
Another question is how much is enough. At what point does the message make its
point? If the advertising period is too short or there are too few repetitions, then the message
may have little or no impact. If the period is too long, then ads may suffer from wearout,
which means the audience gets tired of them and stops paying attention.
• Continuity:HowOften?Continuityreferstothewaytheadvertisingisspreadoverthe

Figure14.4.
Apulsing strategyis used to intensify advertising before a buying aperture and then to re-
duce advertising to lower levels until the aperture reopens. The pulse pattern has peaks and val-
leys, also called bursts. Fast-food companies such as McDonald’s and Burger King often use
pulsing patterns as they increase media weight during special promotional pe-
Pulsing Option riods. Although the competition for daily customers suggests continuous ad-
vertising, they will greatly intensify activity to accommodate special events
such as new menu items, merchandise premiums, and contests. Pulsed sched-
ules cover most of the year, but still provide periodic intensity.
After a media schedule has been worked out in terms of what media will
run when and for how long, these decisions are plotted on a media flow chart.
Across the top is the calendar for the period of the campaign and down the side
is the list of media to be used in this campaign. Bars are then drawn across the
Campaign Time
calendar that identify the exact timing of the use of various media. When the
chart is complete, strategies such as pulsing and flighting are easy to observe.
You can also see where reminder advertising in less expensive media (in-store
signs) may fill in between bursts and pulsing in more expensive media such as
television. You can see a flow chart in the media plan example that follows later
in the chapter.
Aflighting strategyis the most severe type of continuity adjustment. It is
characterized by alternating periods of intense advertising activity and periods
of no advertising, called a hiatus. This on-and-off schedule allows for a longer
campaign. The hope in using nonadvertising periods is that the consumers will
remember the brand and its advertising for some time after the ads have

egy works, there will be a carryover effectof past advertising, which means
consumers will remember the product across the gap un-
til the next advertising period begins. The critical decision
involves analyzing the decay level, the rate at which
memory of the advertising is forgotten.
Size and Position Strategies In addition to selecting
the media mix, a media planner works with the creative
team to determine the appropriate size and length of the
message for each medium. This question of scope and
scale applies to all media—even transit advertising, as
the Yellow Cab ad illustrates.

CHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 435
Media Weighting Media planners often use decision
criterion called weighting to help them decide how
much to budget (we have referred to this as “heavy
up”) in each DMAor region and for each target audi-
ence when there is more than one. For example, if a
media planner is advertising disposable contact lenses,
there might be two target segments to consider: con-
sumers who need help with their eyesight and the eye
doctors who make the recommendations. You may re-
call the discussion of push and pull strategies in
Chapter 2, which is also relevant here. If the strategy is
to encourage the consumer to ask the doctor about the
product, the planner might recommend putting more
emphasis on consumer publications to execute a pull
strategyrather than focusing on professional journals
for eye doctors, which would represent a push strat-
egy.Aweighting strategy might be to put 60 percent of
the budget on consumers and 40 percent on doctors.
In the case of DMAs, weak markets may be given

in terms of seasonality, geography, audience segments,
and the level of brand development by DMA.
Step 4: Media Metrics and Analytics
Like every other aspect of marketing communication, media plans are driven by questions of ac-
countability. And because media decisions are based on measurable factors, identifiable costs, and
budget limitations, media planners are engrossed in calculating the impact and efficiency of their
media recommendations. As a MediaBank executive said, “Media departments are no place for
guessing. With millions—even tens or hundreds of millions—of dollars at stake, clients want hard
data showing that their budgets are being well spent.”6

To find a plan’s GRPs, you multiply each media vehicle’s rating by the number of ads
insertedintoeachmediavehicleduringthedesignatedtimeperiodandaddupthetotalforthe
vehicles.
Once the media vehicles that produce the GRPs have been identified, computer programs can
be used to break down the GRPs into reach and frequency (R&F) numbers. These R&F models are
based on consumer media use research and produce data showing to what extent audiences, view-
ers, and readers overlap.
To illustrate how GRPs are determined and the difference in R&F from one media plan to an-
other (using the same budget), look at the two media mixes that follow. Both are for a simple TV
media plan for a pizza brand. As you will remember from Chapter 12, a rating pointis 1 percent
of a defined media universe (country, region, DMA, or some other target audience description) of
households unless otherwise specified. Insertionsare the number of ads placed in each media ve-
hicle/program within a given period of time (generally four weeks). For example, in Table 14.1, if
436 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
the plan delivered a household rating of 6 with eight insertions, the program Survivor would
achieve an estimated 48 GRPs.
Using the same budget, the two different media mixes produce different GRPtotals. Agood me-
dia planner will look at several different mixes of programs that reach the target audience, figure the
GRPs for each, and then break this calculation into R&F estimates for each plan. Because ratings are
in percentages, the GRPs in both the plans in these tables indicate they reach more than 100 percent.
Of course, this is impossible, just as it’s impossible to eat 156 percent of a pie. This is why these num-
bers are called gross rating points; they include exposure duplication. Nevertheless, knowing the
GRPs of different plans is helpful in choosing which plan delivers more for the money budgeted.
How would computer models calculate reach and frequency numbers based on achieving
208 GRPs in plan A? The media mix model would estimate something close to the following:
R(cid:4)35, F (cid:4)6.9. (Even though reach is a percent, industry practice is to not use the percent sign
for reach numbers.) For plan B where the number of GRPs is 176, the estimated R&F would be
R(cid:4)55, F (cid:4)3.2.

How do you decide which is best? If a brand has a tightly targeted audience and wants to use
repetition to create a strong brand presence, then plan Amight be a wise choice because it has a
higher frequency (6.9 vs. 3.2). If, however, a brand has a fairly simple message where frequency
is less important, a planner would probably choose plan B because it has significantly higher
reach. The reason for the higher reach (55 vs. 35) with plan B, even though it has fewer GRPs, is
that plan B has a much more diverse set of programs that attract a more diverse audience than

Since the total audience obviously includes waste coverage, the estimate of targeted rating
points (TRPs)adjusts the calculation to exclude the waste coverage so it more accurately reflects
CHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 437
the percentage of the target audience watching a program. Because the waste coverage is elimi-
nated, the TRPs are lower than the total audience GRPs. Targeted rating points are, like R&F, de-
termined by media usage research data, which is available from syndicated research services like
MRI and from the major media vehicles themselves.
To illustrate the difference between HH GRPs and TRPs, we’ll use media plan A, shown pre-
viously. As shown in Table 14.2, the first column is HH rating points, while the new second col-
umn shows targeted rating points, or the percent of homes reached that include a female, age
25 to 49, with a college degree and an affinity for at least one outdoor sport. The insertions re-
main the same, but the TRPs are greatly reduced, as you can see when you multiply targeted
ratings by insertions. When the 80 TRPs are compared to the 208 HH GRPs, you can see that
128GRPs (208 – 80 (cid:4)128) were of little or no value to a natural food brand. The less waste, the
more efficient the media plan.

We’ve been discussing the basic steps in media planning. Let’s now consider the tools and
techniques of media strategy.
Cost Efficiency
As mentioned earlier, one way to compare budgets with the competition is called share of voice.It sets
the budget relative to your brand’s and your competitors’market share. For example, if your client has
a 40 percent share of the market, then you may decide to spend at a 40 percent share of voice in order
to maintain your brand’s competitive position. To calculate this budget level, you need to find the to-
tal ad spending in your category, as well as the share of market owned by your brand and your key
competitors.7For example, if the category ad spending totals $10 million, and you want your share of
voice to be 40 percent, then you would need to spend $4 million ($10 million (cid:5)0.40(cid:4)$4 million).
At the end of the planning process, after the media mix has been determined, the media plan-
ner will prepare a pie chart showing media allocations,a term that refers to allocating the budget
among the various media chosen. The pie chart shows the amount being spent on each medium
as a proportion of the total media budget. The pie chart visualizes the media mix and the relative
importance of each vehicle in the mix.
Although much of the discussion in this book has been focused on measured advertising me-
dia and their objectives, it’s useful to note that the other IMC disciplines are also concerned about
proving their efficiency. Public relations, for example, has established metrics comparable to
those used in evaluating advertising media. The A Matter of Principlebox explains how impor-
tant it is to integrate not only media planning, but also evaluations of efficiency comparing these
other areas with advertising media planning. The author also explains the concept of earned me-
dia,in contrast to purchased (and measured) media.
CPMs, TCPMs, and CPPs Advertisers don’t make decisions about the media mix solely in
terms of targeting, geography, and schedule considerations. Sometimes the decision comes down

to cold, hard cash. The advertiser wants prospects, not just readers, viewers, or listeners; there-
fore, they compare the cost of each proposed media vehicle with the specific vehicle’s ability to
deliver the target audience. The cheapest vehicle may not deliver the highest percent of the target
audience, and the highest priced vehicle may deliver exactly the right target audience, so the se-
lection process is a balancing act between cost and reach.
The process of measuring a target audience’s size against the cost of reaching that audience

sand and cost per point.
The term cost per thousand (CPM)is industry shorthand for the cost of getting 1,000 im-
pressions. CPM is best used when comparing the cost of vehicles within the same medium
(comparing one magazine with another or one television program with another). This is be-
cause different media have different levels of impact. To be more precise and determine the ef-
ficiency of a potential media buy, planners often look at the targeted cost per thousand
(TCPM).
CHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 439
To calculate a CPM for a broadcast commercial, you need only two figures: the cost of an
ad and the estimated audience reached by the vehicle. Multiply the cost of the ad by 1,000 and di-
vide that number by the size of the broadcast audience. You multiply the cost of the ad by 1,000
to calculate a “cost per thousand.”

• Calculating CPMIn the following example, CPM is calculated based on Timereadership
and the price of a one-page, four-color ad, $240,000. Remember, you want to know what it
costs to reach 1,000 readers.
Cost of ad (cid:5) 1,000

Readership
$240,000 (cid:5) 1,000
CPM (cid:4) (cid:4) $12.31 CPM
19,500,000
• Calculating TCPMTo figure the TCPM, you first determine how many of Time’s readers
are in your target audience. For the sake of discussion, we’ll say that only 5 million of
Time’sreaders fall into our target audience profile. As you can see from the following calcu-
lation, the TCPM greatly increases. This is because you still have to pay to reach all the
readers, even though only about one-fourth of them are of value to you.
Cost of ad (cid:5) 1,000
TCPM (cid:4)
Readers in target audience
$240,000 (cid:5) 1,000
TCPM (cid:4) (cid:4) $48.00 TCPM
5,000,000
• Calculating CPPNow we’ll look at how to determine cost per point (CPP),which esti-
mates the cost of reaching 1 million households based on a program’s rating points. Divide
the cost of running one commercial by the rating of the program in which the commercial
will appear. If a 30-second spot on Lostcosts $320,000, and it has a rating of 8, then the cost
per rating point would be $40,000:
$320,000
CPP = = $40,000 CPP
8 rating
• Calculating TCPPTo figure the targeted cost per point (TCPP), the rating points based on
the target audience you want to reach, determine what percentage of the audience is your tar-
get. In the case of Lost,we will estimate that half of the audience is our target. Thus, the
overall rating of 8 is reduced to 4 (50% (cid:5)8(cid:4)4 rating). Now we divide the one-time cost of
$320,000 by 4 and find the TCPPis $80,000:
$320,000
TCPP = = $80,000 TCPP
4 target rating
We can do this calculation to compare several different programs and identify those
with lower costs.

Media Optimization In our earlier discussion of media mix strategy, we looked at the efficiency
of various media plans. Tools that help estimate the most optimum use of various media plans us-
ing computer models involve calculating the weight of a media schedule and optimizing the
schedule for the greatest impact. These optimizationtechniques enable marketers to determine
the relative impact of a media mix on product sales and optimize the efficiency of the media mix.
Generally the models can create an unlimited number of media combinations and then sim-
ulate the sales produced by each. Chrysler’s digital agency, Organic, has designed a system to de-
termine the best way to allocate the marketing communication budget. Here’s how it works: “The
system calculates how much ad spending is needed to meet certain sales targets and then analyzes
how both online and offline ads affect Web activity and, ultimately, sales.”9Using optimization
models, the media planner can make intelligent decisions, given factors such as budget, timing,
and so forth. Other optimization services are CPM Advisors (www.cpmadvisors.com), Aggregate
Knowledge (www.aggregateknowledge.com), and Telmar (www.telmar.com).
The issue of media optimization, however, is bigger than just numbers and estimates of ef-
ficiency. It also involves questions of media overload and consumer irritation, as the A Matter of
Principlefeature argues.
A Sample Media Plan
Media plans do not have a universal form, but there is a common (and logical) pattern to the de-
cision stages as we have outlined in this chapter. To illustrate one style of presentation in a real-
life setting, we use an actual media plan for a Women’s Health Services program based in
hospitals. This media plan example was contributed by Amy Hume, who was media director
CHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 441
WOMEN’S HEALTH SERVICES MEDIA PLAN
Launched in winter 2009–10 in hospitals throughout the central United States, the Women’s Health Services Program
(WHSP) combines the health care services that women may be exposed to throughout their lives under one roof. It
brings together services beyond just gynecology, like oncology, dermatology, cardiology, and more. It aids women by
providing one central point of contact—a concierge—to coordinate their appointments.
Communication Objectives
• Establish awareness of a new Women’s Health Services Program opening in select local hospitals throughout the
Heartland of the U.S.
• Generate buzz and word of mouth
• Drive requests for information via Web and phone
Strategic Plan Development
While “all women” were the target, we knew that the best opportunity started with wealthy, more educated women
who would act as influencers in the market. As a result, we focused, demographically, on,—Working Women Ages
30–54 with HHI $75M+, with or without kids.
It was important for us to gain further insight into their behaviors and attitudes relating to health care, commu-
nication and everyday routines. Via both syndicated research and primary research we uncovered many insights that
helped direct the plan:
Activities/Behaviors
• They work out?—either at home, in a club, or outdoors.
• They exercise to manage their weight, be more relaxed, reduce health problems.
• While most women are not passionate about working out, many say it is an essential part of their lives.
• They travel to/from work an average of 7.5 miles—either in car or public transportation (depending on the market).
• They go to a coffee shop usually 1x/day—both independents and chains.
• They use the Internet for e-mail, social networking and to research just about anything.
• But particularly health-related issues—2/3 of online health site users are female.
• Women make 75% of health care decisions, spend 2/3 of health care $, and account for 2/3 of hospital procedures.
Attitudes
• Women’s most influential source of information or advice is their circle of friends:
• Women rely on advice and opinions of those individuals around them who have proven themselves in the past.
• They respond to anecdotes/storytelling—they will connect to an engaging narrative relating the lives and experi-
ences of other women.
• Through our primary research we found that many women have phone conversations with female relatives
once/day.
• Conversation serves many purposes in women’s lives: recharging, validation, and learning.
• Women focus on the emotional—happiness, peace of mind, fulfillment, self-confidence—vs. more traditional,
material, outward manifestations of success.
• When choosing health care they are looking for:
• “Someone who knows me,” “Ability to help with issues,” “Treat me as an individual.”
• It’s important for women to be communicated to on a personal level.
• They believe it’s stressful and hard to find a physician who’s interested in their overall health.

awareness involved two tasks: generating buzz among the target audience and creating
442 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
With this background and research, we were able to establish our key strategies.
Strategies
• Overall, we determined that we would be most effective by using a combination of traditional and non-traditional
vehicles that intersect women in relevant, yet respectful places—and in non-traditional ways.
• We knew that it was important to seek contacts that increase relevance—that tie into her perception of healthy
living—nutrition, fitness, and relaxation—and into her passions—family and hobbies.
• Also, we needed to recommend contacts that would help provide impact, and thus increased receptivity of the mes-
sage. Those that would signal “for me” (personal, part of my world), be trustworthy, and provide opportunity for
narrative/storytelling.
• Finally, it was important to get out of the traditional health care mold and get her to react and engage.
Who (Target)
Active Female Health Managers
• Working women, married, ages 30–54, with or without kids
• More likely to ask their doctor to send them to a preferred specialist or hospital
• Indirectly, their knowledge, experience, and passion for updated health information makes them a valuable re-
source?—they have a large sphere of influence.
Where (Geography)
While the program itself was launching in 10 cities, we decided to focus on the more efficiently priced, mid-sized metro
areas in the Central U.S. —Minneapolis, Denver, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Kansas City.
When (Timing/Seasonality)
Launch September 2009 to lead up to multi-city opening. Also coincides with time of “renewal” with the back-to-
school mentality.
Provide additional support in January as people are making resolutions—mostly in the area of health.
Follow up with an effort in May tied into Women’s Health month.
How Much (Weight Levels/Budget)
We analyzed competitive advertising pressure of other hospitals and health centers in these markets as well as promi-
nent women’s programs like Brigham & Women’s, Oregon Health & Science University Center for Women’s Health, and
the Iris Cantor Women’s Health Center. We determined that there was little consistent mass media pressure in any mar-
ket by these entities.
enough interest that the campaign would cause the target to search for information using the
website and phone number provided in the campaign materials.
• Strategic Plan Development:Consumer InsightsThe key to this media plan is under-
standing the consumer market for the Women’s Health Services Program (WHSP).
Background research from the campaign’s situation analysis is used to describe the
women in this market in terms of their activities and behaviors, as well as their attitudes
and feelings.
CHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 443
Due to the absence of substantive competitive reach and frequency benchmarks by competition or like programs,
based weight level objectives on history and experience:
• During launch, generate 85% reach/4.0 frequency per month
• For follow-up months, 65%/3.0 as budget allows
We were working with a Year One budget of $3.0MM to cover all markets.
What (Vehicle Selection)
Magazines: Be where they’re searching for health care information—62% of women ranked magazines as their #1
source of information for healthy eating habits, fitness, health, and overall well-being. They will provide the oppor-
tunity for long-form messaging. Recommend use of local magazines as well as regional editions of national maga-
zines to provide reach.
Radio:Close to50% of active health managers listen to the radio everyday; and 50% always listen when they’re in their
car; they rely on radio to keep them informed. But, they tend to change the station when commercials come on. Thus,
we need to use radio in a non-traditional manner. Recommended using 1–2 top-reaching stations per market and
establish relationships with key DJs. Bring them to the Center’s pre-opening to experience the staff, the atmosphere,
and expose them to the services so that they will then talk about the Center during their shows. This will
allow women to hear from a trusted source, yet via a good reaching medium, while not immediately turning the dial.
Out-of-Home: Use traditional billboards and transit advertising to intersect women during their daily routine. Helps
create a surround-sound approach.
Place-Based: Based on their daily routines and behaviors, we recommended placements in Health Clubs, Coffee
Shops, Grocery Stores, and Mall/Retail Centers. The messaging would need to be specially tailored to these en-
vironments and placements.
Internet:
• Other websites: Determine key sites within each city and talk with top-rated health sites nationally to gain a
presence—particularly contextually via articles. Research blogs and chat rooms to determine other electronic
avenues for contact.
• Social media: Use social networking technologies like Twitter to push out news about the doctors and other
specialists working in the programs, information on events .
•WHSP website: Develop a website that will provide resources and links for women including the opportunity for
community such as: blogging, chat rooms, message boards, as well as a feedback and research tool. Aggregate
content that affects all women, but be specific when it comes to each community to ensure the local flavor and
expertise. Also recognize that women will need to be pulled into the site via news, information—important to
first go where they are first.
• Hospital websites: Tie into the partner hospital websites to create a special women’s corner that links to the
WHSP site.
Events/Seminars:Invite women in each community to a grand opening celebration with 2–3 key speakers. Follow up with
quarterly seminars, which will encourage women to spread the word—“bring your sister or your mom.” Developa
membership program that will provide an opportunity for Brand Ambassadors, creating a women’s health care
“community.”

444 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
WHAT IS THE BIG PICTURE OF MEDIA PLANNING?
As we have noted previously, when most people think about media, they think about traditional
mass media and advertising. Media planning in an IMC context is complicated by the ways me-
dia interact in integrated programs. We’ll discuss two of these practices that add complexity to
the process: IMC planning and global media planning.
IMC and Contact Point Planning
When IMC planners think about media, they think about message delivery systems and that in-
cludes all of the media used in various types of marketing communication. Direct response, for
example, which is the topic of Chapter 16, can appear in traditional media (print with fill-in-
blanks to get more information about a brand or place an order; infomercials on TV), but also in
letters mailed directly to the home or office, telemarketing (phone calls to the home or office),
and in digital forms, such as e-mail and Twitter. Public relations places stories in all of the tradi-
tional media including trade media, but also uses publicity tours, speeches and interviews with
executives, special events, corporate videos, blogs, and websites, to name a few.
As DePaul University marketing professor Steve Kelly says, “Because the Internet allows
marketers to make their marketing dollars measurable and accountable, much like the direct mar-
keters have done for years, the goal now is to make all marketing communications measurable.
Thus, integrated marketing communications becomes the goal.” He explains, “IMC tries to tie it
all together. IMC is the goal of most marketers, but multichannel is what they actually do.”10
An example of IMC multimedia planning comes from The Today Show, which launched a
new recipe website and mobile application in sponsorship with Unilever. The “Cooking School”
website contains previously aired segments of “Today’s Kitchen” and streaming video webisodes,
as well as recipes, cooking tips, and promotions for Unilever brands such as Bertolli, Country
Crock, Hellmann’s, and Ragu. The recipes can be downloaded at home or to a mobile device. A
Smartphone app allows users to compile recipes and build shopping lists. The “Cooking School”
partnership links mobile, online, and broadcast media.11
Another distinctive feature of IMC media plans is its emphasis on contact points. Media
planning in an IMC campaign focuses on every important contact point. These can include a va-
riety of experiential media, as well as conventional media. Think about all the ways you come in
contact with a brand message when you fly on an airline—reservations, check in, baggage check-
ing, the gate, the cabin attendants and officer’s messages over the loudspeaker, the seats and food
and other cabin features, departure and arrival times, deplaning, baggage again, not to mention
customer service when you miss a plane or a bag gets lost. That’s just a brief list and you can prob-
ably add to it. Alist of contact points an IMC planner might consider would be endless, but a sam-
ple list is available online on this book’s website (www.pearsonhighered.com/moriarty).
Dentsu’s ContactPoint Management Tokyo-based Dentsu, which is the world’s largest individual
agency, has a strong IMC orientation, which shows up in the way Dentsu planners create IMC me-
dia plans. Dentsu’s ContactPoint Management offering is a section in its IMC 2.0 model that identi-
fies a wide diversity of contact points, including but not limited to such separate communication
functions as public relations, sponsorship, direct-response marketing, events, word of mouth
(WOM), in-store (signage, POP, personnel), sales promotion, traditional advertising media (broadcast,
print, out-of-home), sports, entertainment, interactive (Web, podcasting), mobile media, and new out-
of-home (OOH) media. Let’s take a closer look at Dentsu’s approach to IMC media planning.12
The objective of Dentsu’s ContactPoint Management planning is to select the most effective
contact points required to achieve the desired communication goals and to implement optimum
integrated communication programs that eliminate waste. ContactPoint Management focuses on
two strategies that are critical in delivering effective integrated communication:
1. Identify the value contact points, that is, the emotion-driving points at which or during
which consumers come in contact with a brand.
2. Move away from the traditional B2C model, in which business targets a consumer with a
message, to a more interactive B2C2C model, in which a business talks to consumers who
talk to other consumers. This approach uses mass media to stimulate interconsumer com-
munications, or word of mouth, which delivers messages more persuasively.
CHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 445
Media selection recognizes that (1) contact points that work well must differ depending on
the communication goal and (2) contact point effectiveness will differ from product category to
product category and from target to target.
An example of how Dentsu manages a full set of brand contact points comes from an auto-
motive campaign where two target audiences have been identified as Fathers (male, 50s) and
Daughters (female, 20s). The communication objective is to position the new subcompact car
model as “fun driving for grown men” and “a small cute model for young women.”
The various contact points considered are evaluated and ranked using a proprietary contact
point planning system called VALCON (Value ContactPoint Tracer). Dentsu planners also have
access to hundreds of media-related databases with vast volumes of contact point information to
consult in this process. The final decisions about media usage are based on the roles and effects
of the various media.
For the new subcompact, contact points were evaluated based on three objectives: their ability
to launch a new product (recognition, build awareness), arouse interest (evaluation), and make the
target feel like buying (intention, attitude). Here are the results by points assigned to various options:

Cross-Media Integration Media selection also considers message needs. Here is where media
planning and message planning intersect. Brand reminders, for example, are often found in tele-
vision commercials and in OOH media. More complex information-laden messages are more
likely to be found in magazines, direct mail, or publicity releases. If you want to stimulate im-
mediate action, you might use daily newspapers, radio, or sales promotion.
With the increasing push into digital media, the chief marketing officer at a digital media com-
pany reminds planners that “Brand advertising is about telling a story, not just directing traffic.”
446 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
TheAtlantic Monthly
magazine used a
multiplatform
campaign that
integrated messages
from neon signs to
create an event that
was filmed for videos
that were seen on a
website.
He calls for refocusing on media basics: “Interactivity has given us new options to tell a story, so-
cial media have given us tools to make it spread, and digital more broadly has forced advertisers
to consider utility to the user.” But he insists: “The basics persist—find paths to the consumers
where you can get scale, buy attention, and repeat.”13
The challenge is to create cross-media integration, which means the various media work to-
gether to create coherent brand communication. Planners seek to create a synergistic effect be-
tween the messages delivered in different media. In traditional media, this is sometimes called
image transferand refers to the way radio, in particular, reinforces and re-creates the message in
a listener’s mind that was originally delivered by other media, particularly TV.
An example of cross-media integration comes from the revitalization campaign for the Atlantic
Monthlymagazine. To reinforce its position as an intellectual leader, the campaign used the slogan:
“Think. Again.” To bring that idea to life, the campaign presented 14 of Atlantic’smost thought-
provoking questions as 14 huge neon signs placed around New York. At night the creative team
taped interviews with viewers as they wondered about the brightly lit messages. These videos,
which showcased the personal, profound, and sometimes hilarious responses, were housed on a
website and used as a hub for a debate of these great issues. So it was OOH marketing that created
an event that turned into videos that enlivened a website (see http://thinkagain.theatlantic.com). In
this case, to quote media scholar Marshall McLuhan, media became the message. Was it success-
ful? The magazine saw a double-digit increase in readership and the number of visitors to
TheAtlantic.comincreased by 27 percent over the previous year.
Global Media Planning
Advertising practitioners can debate global theories of advertising, but one fact is inescapable: a true
global medium does not currently exist, which means global media plans have to piece together
worldwide coverage using a variety of media tools. Television can transmit the Olympics around
the globe, but no one network controls this global transmission. An advertiser seeking global expo-
sure, therefore, must deal with different networks and different vehicles in different countries.
Satellite transmission now places advertising into many homes, but its availability is not uni-
versal because of the footprint(coverage area of the satellite), technical limitations, and regula-
tions of transmission by various governments. Satellites beam signals to more than one country
in Europe, the Asian subcontinent, North America, and the Pacific, but they are regional, not
global, in coverage. Despite its regional limitation, satellite transmission is still an enormous fac-
tor in the changing face of international advertising. Star TV, with an audience spanning 38 coun-
tries, including Egypt, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Russia’s Asian provinces, reaches a market of
some 2.7 billion people. It is closely followed by CNN and ESPN. Sky Channel, a U.K.-based
CHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 447
network, offers satellite service to most of Europe, giving advertisers the opportunity to deliver a
unified message across the continent.
The North American, European, Asian, and Latin American markets are becoming saturated
with cable TVcompanies offering an increasing number of international networks. Such broad-
casters include the hugely successful Latin American networks of Univision and Televisa, whose
broadcasts can be seen in nearly every Spanish-speaking market, including the United States. One
of Univision’s most popular programs, Sabado Giganta, is seen by tens of millions of viewers in
16 countries.
HOW DOES MEDIA BUYING WORK?
So far in this chapter, you’ve read about media plans and the key steps you would take to develop
a media plan, and you looked at some important big picture issues related to media planning. As
you recall, the media plan is a recommendation that the client must approve before any further
steps are taken. In fact, planning is only the first stage in advertising media operations. Once the
plan directions are set, media buyers convert objectives and strategies into tactical decisions.
They select specific media vehicles and negotiate and contract for the time and space in media.
In this section we explain how the media buyer makes the media plan come to life. Amedia buyer
has distinct responsibilities as outlined in Figure 14.6.
Media Buying Complexities
Buying is a complicated process. The American Association of Advertising Agencies lists no
fewer than 21 elements of a media buy. The most important one, however, is matching the media
vehicle to the strategic needs of the message and the brand. In this section, we examine the most
important buyer activities: providing information to media planners, selecting the media vehicles,
negotiating costs, monitoring the media choices, evaluating the media choices after the campaign, Principle
and handling billing and payment. Media buyers should
be consulted early in
• Provide Inside InformationMedia buyers are important information sources for media plan-
planning as they are
ners. They are close enough to day-to-day changes in media popularity and pricing to be an a good source of
important source of inside current information. For example, a newspaper buyer discovers information on changes
that a key newspaper’s delivery staff is going on strike, or a magazine buyer’s source reveals in media.

that the new editor of a publication is going to change
the editorial focus dramatically. All of these things can
influence the strategy and tactics of current and future
advertising plans.
• Select Media VehiclesThe media planner determines
the media mix, but the buyer is responsible for choos-
ing the specific media vehicles. AMediaweekarticle,
for example, identifies patterns in media buyers’deci-
sion making. Astudy reported in 2010 found that
ESPN was the top cable choice of media buyers, fol-
lowed by Disney, TNT, TBS, the Food Network,
USA, HGTV, Comedy Central, and Bravo. In terms
of buys on network TV, the study found that ABC
was best, followed by Fox, NBC, and CBS.14In terms
of programs, American Idolhas been the most-
watched show on TVsince 2007, even though its
numbers started dropping in 2009. More than 25 mil-
lion watched the show in 2009.15Online media buy-
ing is usually handled through ad networks and the
big portals. AOL, Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft are
four of the five biggest online ad networks; the
Microsoft Media Network is the fastest growing
service.16
Armed with the media plan directives, the buyer
seeks answers to a number of difficult questions as vari-
ous media vehicles are considered. Does the vehicle have

for a complex ad. those questions bear directly on the campaign’s success.
• NegotiateJust as a person buying a car often negotiates for the best price, so does a media
buyer negotiate for the best prices. The key questions are whether the desired vehicles are
available and whether a satisfactory schedule and rates can be negotiated. Aside from finding
the aperture of target audiences, nothing is more crucial in media buying than securing the
lowest possible price for placements.
Every medium has a published rate card, but media buyers often negotiate special prices for
volume buys. The buyer must understand the trade-off between price received and audience ob-
jectives. For example, a media buyer might be able to get a lower price for 30 commercials on
ESPN, but part of the deal is that half the spots are scheduled with programs that don’t reach the
primary target audience. So the price may not be a good deal in the long run. Here are some other
negotiation considerations:
• Bargain for Preferred PositionsMedia buyers must bargain for preferred positions,the lo-
cations in magazines and other print media that offer readership advantages (see Chapter 12).
Imagine the value a food advertiser would gain from having its message located in a special
recipe section that the homemaker can detach from the magazines for permanent use. How
many additional exposures might that ad get? Because they are so visible, preferred posi-
tions often carry a premium surcharge, usually 10 to 15 percent above standard space rates.
• Demand Extra Support OffersWith the current trend toward using other forms of market-
ing communication in addition to advertising, buyers often demand additional promotional
support. These activities, sometimes called value-added media services,can take any num-
ber of forms, including contests, special events, merchandising space at stores, displays, and
trade-directed newsletters. The “extra” depends on what facilities each media vehicle has
and how hard the buyer can bargain.
CHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 449
• Monitor PerformanceAmedia buyer’s responsibility to a campaign does not end with the
signing of space and time contracts. The media buyer is responsible for tracking the perfor-
mance of the media plan as it is implemented and afterward as part of the campaign evalua-
tion. Buys are made in advance, based on forecasted audience levels. What happens if
unforeseen events affect scheduling? What if newspapers go on strike, magazines fold, or a
television show is canceled? Buyers must fix these problems. Underperformance and sched-
ule problems are facts of life. Poorly performing vehicles must be replaced, or costs must be
modified. Buyers also check the publication issues to verify whether advertisements have
been placed correctly. Buyers also make every attempt to get current audience research to
ensure that schedules are performing according to forecast. Media buyers are even found out
“riding the boards,” which means they check the location of the outdoor boards to verify that
the client is receiving the outdoor exposure specified in the plan.
• Postcampaign EvaluationOnce a campaign is completed, the planner’s duty is to compare
the plan’s expectations and forecasts with what actually happened. Did the plan actually
achieve GRP, reach, frequency, and CPM objectives? Did the newspaper and magazine
placements run in the positions expected? Such analysis is instrumental in providing guid-
ance for future media plans.
• Monitor Billing and PaymentBills from the various media come in continuously. Ulti-
mately, it is the responsibility of the advertiser to make these payments. However, the
agency is contractually obligated to pay the invoice on behalf of the client. Keeping track of
the invoices and paying the bills are the responsibility of the media buyer in conjunction
with the accounting department.
In addition to negotiating, bargaining, buying, and monitoring the execution of a media plan,
media buyers also have to deal with situations that crop up and complicate the planning. In effect,
they are also troubleshooters. Buyers deal with the temporary snags in scheduling and in the repro-
duction of advertising messages that are sometimes unavoidable. Buyers must be alert for missed po-
sitions or errors in handling the message presentation and ensure that the advertiser is compensated
appropriately when they occur. Apolicy of compensating for such errors is called “making good on
the contract,” known as make goods.Here are some of the common problems they may run into:
• Program PreemptionsSpecial programs or news events sometimes interrupt regular pro-
gramming and the scheduled commercials. In the case of long-term program preemptions,
such as war coverage, buyers may have difficulty finding suitable replacements before the
schedule ends.
• Missed ClosingsMagazines and newspapers have clearly set production deadlines, called
closings, for each issue. Sometimes the advertising materials do not arrive in time. If the
publication is responsible, it will make good. If the fault lies with the client or the agency,
the publication makes no restitution.
• Technical ProblemsTechnical difficulties are responsible for numerous goofs, glitches, and
foul-ups that haunt the advertiser’s schedule. Bleed-throughs(the printing on the back side
of the page is visible and conflicts with the client’s ad on the front side) and out-of-register
color(full-color printing is made from four-color plates, which sometimes are not perfectly
aligned) for newspapers, torn billboard posters, broken film, and tapes out of alignment are
typical problems.

Multichannel Buying (and Selling) It should be clear from this review of media buyers’re-
sponsibilities that this is a challenging job. Anumber of media services are available to help make
buying for complicated media plans easier.
General Electric and its media arm, NBC Universal, for example, promoted its media op-
portunities using a multichannel plan that includes broadcast, cable, and the Internet, as well as

original programming on its own channels. But the difference is that the media deals are pack-
aged around a cause, such as the environment or wellness. Campbell Soup, for example, spon-
sored health segments on NBC’s The Today Show, as well as Dr. Nancy Snyderman’s MSNBC
health program.18The idea is to match the media use of the target audience in all its complexity.
Newspapers have long offered simplified buys through such companies as Nationwide
Newspapers, which can handle classified and display advertising in more than 21,000 newspa-
pers. The Newspaper National Network is a trade association representing some 9,000 newspa-
pers that also handles ad placement. In the digital world, DoubleClick’s DARTfor Advertisers
(DFA) service helps advertisers manage online display and search marketing campaigns across
online channels. All of these services not only place ads, but also provide performance data to
help optimize a buy, as well as report on the effectiveness of a marketer’s specific plan.

Global Media Buying The definition of global media buying varies widely, but everyone agrees
that few marketers are doing it yet. However, many are thinking about it, especially computer and
other information technology companies that are being pursued by media such as CNN. Today,
the growth area is media buys across a single region. As media become more global, however,
some marketers are beginning to make the leap across regions. About 60 percent of ad buys on
CNN International are regional, and 40 percent are global.
In Europe, the rise of buying “centrals” came about with the emergence of the European
Union and the continuing globalization of trade and advertising. Buying centralsare media or-
ganizations that buy across several European countries. Their growth also began with the devel-
opment of commercial broadcasting and the expansion of media choices. These firms have
flourished in an environment of flexible and negotiated rates, low inflation, and a fragmented ad-
vertising market. The buying centrals have nearly three-fourths of the media market in France,
nine-tenths in Spain, and about two-fifths in Britain, Holland, Italy, and Scandinavia.
The important thing, however, is to be able to consider cultural implications in media use.
For that reason media planning and buying companies are also specializing or buying companies
that know specific cultures, such as the Hispanic market in the United States and the Chinese mar-
ket in Asia. Zenithoptimedia, for example, is a global media-buying company that has created ZO
Multicultural, a multicultural unit that helps clients trying to reach ethnic markets.
Media Planning and Buying Trends
Advertising experts have been proclaiming the demise of mass media advertising for a number
of years. It reached a high buzz level when Bob Garfield, an Advertising Age columnist, got
industry-wide attention with his book, The Chaos Scenario,in which he speculated about the me-
dia landscape in coming years when over-the-air network TVis gone and everyone accesses their
news, entertainment, and advertising any way they wish: TV, phone, camera, laptop, game con-
sole, or MP3 player. His concept of “listenomics” emphasizes the importance of consumer-in-
charge media choices.19
The truth is that the media landscape is dynamic and changing so fast that it’s hard to keep
track of how the media business is practiced. All of these changes create new ways of operation
and new opportunities for innovative media planners and buyers.
CHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 451
Unbundling Media Buying and Planning We’ve mentioned before the growth of media-buying
services, such as the media megashop Starcom MediaVest, as separate companies that specialize
in media buying. This is a shift in the way the media industry is organized, a change referred to
asunbundling media services.This happens when an agency transforms its media department
into a separate profit center, apart from the agency. This then allows the media group to work for
clients who may be competitors to some of those handled by the agency. Because these compa-
nies control the money, they have become a powerful force in the advertising industry, leading to
a tug of war over control of planning. Faced with competition from these independent media com-
panies, many large agencies have set up or bought their own buying services to compete with the
independents and go after outside business.
Some of these media companies are now offering consolidated services, which means
bringing the planning and buying functions back together. To take advantage of this consolida-
tion argument, some media companies are also adding special planning teams for other related ar-
eas such as events, product placement, Internet, and guerilla marketing programs. WPP’s
MindShare created an agency-within-the-agency called the Wow Factory to develop ideas for
nontraditional media.20For a major presentation to Coca-Cola, Starcom MediaVest pulled a team
together that represented basic media planning and buying, research, consumer insights, pro-
gramming, product placement, entertainment marketing, and integration solutions.21At this point,
these big media companies begin to look more like traditional agencies.
Online Media Buying A bigger threat to agencies than media-buying services comes from
Google and Yahoo!, which, although not ad agencies, are making inroads into media buying and
selling. Google is using its website to sell ads primarily to small advertisers and publishers who
find its automated advertising network, Google Adworks, to be a cost-effective way to connect
with one another. Agencies are trying to figure out if Google and Yahoo! are friends or enemies
and what their move into online media buying will do to the revenue stream. Google, however, is
betting that its expertise in search advertising, which matches ads to user interests, will give it an
advantage over traditional ad media services.
New Forms of Media Research As we mentioned earlier, one challenge media planners face is
the lack of reliable audience research and measurement metrics for the new media. The traditional
“measured” media with their CPMs were at least somewhat predictable in level of impact. But
the metrics for online media—hits and clicks—don’t really tell us much about impact. Compar-
ing TRPs and clicks is like comparing apples and oranges.
We also know that exposure does not equal attention, which is a huge problem for evaluat-
ing the impact of television. In other words, just because the television is on does not mean any-
one is watching; and just because a program is on does not mean anyone is watching the ads.
Search advertising on the Internet is also complicating things because, if it’s successful, it
steals viewers away from the original site. Does ESPN benefit when viewers leave its site to click
on the banner ad for StubHub Ticket Center? As one critic observed, search advertising may make
sense as a form of direct marketing, but it is a nightmare for content publishers who sell adver-
tising on their pages. In such a situation, how do you evaluate efficiency of the publisher’s site?
Of the search advertising? If one is a winner, doesn’t that automatically mean the other is a loser?
Viral marketing is equally difficult to measure, although YouTube is developing analytic
data to help media planners assess the impact of the video-sharing site. Other companies such as
Visible Measures, Unruly Media, and Millward Brown’s Link provide viral monitoring services
that assess the impact not only of YouTube, but also of multiple online platforms. As such ser-
vices mature, marketers will become smarter about selecting marketing communication messages
with the most viral video potential.22
Another problem is that media research is based on each medium as a silo—separate stud-
ies for separate media. Most of the research services are unable to tell you much about the effec-
tiveness of combined media; the impact such as seeing the same message on television and then
reading about it in a newspaper story or ad is difficult to evaluate.
452 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?
Looking Ahead
That point leads to the next part of the book in which we review specific areas of marketing com-
munication, such as public relations, direct response, sales promotion, and sponsorships—all of
which are important aspects of multiplatform IMC programs. Then we’ll apply this wider world
of IMC to specific situations, such as retail, business-to-business, nonprofit, and international
marketing. We’ll end Part 5 with a discussion of evaluation and wrap up the effectiveness theme
that is so important in today’s brand communication.
IT’S A WRAP
Beauty of a Campaign
This chapter identified media strategies that are relevant to advertisers as they decide how to reach their
audience effectively. The point is that the key to effective customer-focused advertising is staying sensi-
tive to consumers and understanding how they think, act, and feel—and where they’ll be able connect with
the brand message.
The provocative copy in the Dove “Campaign for Real Beauty” challenges the audience to reconsider
how they define beauty and to love their bodies, no matter what their age or shape. The campaign gener-
ated a huge buzz. But did it work to sell the product?
According to Unilever, the campaign resulted in a 24 percent sales increase during the advertising period
across the entire Dove brand.
The brand also fared well globally. When it was launched in the United Kingdom, sales of Dove Firming
Lotion reportedly increased by 700 percent in the first seven months after the posters appeared. It generated
a substantial press interest, with about 170 editorial pieces written in the first four months after the launch in
Great Britain.
The campaign radically changed the Dove brand image with its culturally relevant message. Initial pub-
licity generated more than 650 million media impressions in the United States, estimated to be worth more
than $21 million in free media exposure.
Moreover, the definition of beauty portrayed in advertising really seems to be changing. When asked
about the images in Dove ads, 76 percent said women in the ad are beautiful, and 68 percent said, “It made
you think differently about the brand.”
Advertising Agenamed the Dove’s “Evolution” Web film as one of its best non-TV campaigns of the
decade. The viral film earned more than 6 million hits and lots of mentions in the national press on shows like
Good Morning AmericaandThe View, which translates to about $150 million worth of media time. Although
the video drew some criticism, overall the response was overwhelmingly positive. The play, Finding Body and
Soul, won a Festival of Media award. Beautiful.

PRINCIPLES: IMC AND
TOTAL COMMUNICATION
Hundreds of different communication activities deliver brand messages both formally through
planned communication programs and informally through other activities. This section provides
a framework for you to understand how all of these programs and tools can work together to en-
gage target audiences with consistent, persuasive messages that get people talking about a brand.
In this part we introduce a collection of key marketing communication tools whose activi-
ties need to be coordinated as part of an integrated communication program. To help you under-
stand how this works to deliver effective brand communication, consider the summary of lessons
learned by Professor Tom Duncan, one of the early leaders in IMC education.
Lessons We Have Learned
about IMC
Originally IMC was about creating “one voice, one look” across all messages in a campaign. So
the print ad “looked like” the television commercial and the billboard matched the website. We
now know that a more effective approach to IMC has moved from this narrow “execution” fo-
cus to a much broader focus on branding and customer brand perceptions. Rather than just
using advertising to sell products, companies now want to use everything that sends a
message to create a coherent brand presence that leads to long-term brand relationships.

IMC is a common-sense ongoing process for managing brand perceptions and experiences,
as well as customer expectations about the brand. IMC planning delivers the brand essence (po-
sition, personality, image) in all marketing communication, but also at all brand contact points.
It engages all stakeholders in meaningful and often interactive brand experiences. When these
best practices are applied, they lead to solid brand relationships and that leads to enhanced brand
equity.
The chapters in this part introduce you to the various marketing communication tools and
platforms, including public relations, direct response marketing, and promotions. We tie every-
thing up with a chapter on the IMC umbrella which reviews basic IMC principles and practices,
as well as the big picture of total communication. The last chapter focuses on how these various
tools evaluate effectiveness.

3. What key decisions do public relations practitioners make when they create plans?
4. What are the most common types of public relations tools?
5. Why is measuring the results of public relations efforts important,and how should that be done?
The Ultimate Road Trip
The quest started with Hampton Hotels’ challenge to the public relations firm
Cohn & Wolfe to create awareness among customers of the 1,600 Hampton
hotels across the United States and position the brand as a civic-minded in-
dustry leader. The destination was a campaign that helped save many landmarks
of historical and cultural significance.
So why should a midpriced hotel brand, which includes Hampton Inn and
Hampton Inn & Suites, care about preserving the nation’s landmarks when its busi-
ness is renting rooms?
A road map in the form of research guided the way. Results from a survey of
about 1,000 people revealed that 9 out of 10 Americans believe it is important to
preserve the country’s roadside landmarks. Furthermore, 83 percent of respon-
dents indicated that corporations ought to share responsibility for preserving the
nation’s landmarks.

markingsignificanteventsinthecountry’shistoryastheydrivetotheirdestinations.
Also Hampton stands for traditional American values, civic responsibility, and
devout patriotism. Even its logo is red, white, and blue. So there seemed to be mu-
tual interests between the goals of the corporation and its guests.
But the most important reason for undertaking this project is to build good-
will, the greatest asset any organization can have. A well-informed public with a
positive attitude toward an organization is critical to the organization’s survival—
and that is why creating goodwill, this positive attitude, is the primary goal of most
public relations programs.
Here’s how Cohn & Wolfe, together with Hampton, created a campaign that
generated great pride for the hotel and helped preserve culturally or historically
important roadside landmarks. Some of the highlights of the program included:
• Building a “Save-A-Landmark” website offering vacation or weekend “drive-
abouts” to landmarks across the country
459
460 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
• Making the website interactive by permitting visitors to suggest and vote for
landmarks that needed saving
• Involving nearly 1,000 Hampton employees, who proudly participated in the
restoration projects.
To date, this 10-year initiative has helped save more than 40 landmarks, from
the world’s largest Santa Claus in North Pole, Alaska; to 100-year-old mission bells
in San Diego, California; to an antique wooden carousel in New Orleans; to the
Eleutherian College in Madison, Indiana, the first college in pre-Civil War America
to admit students regardless of race or gender. Most recently, Save-A-Landmark
refurbished the National Civil Rights Museum (seen in opening photo), originally
the Lorraine Motel and site of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Hampton
has donated more than $2.5 million and hundreds of thousands of volunteer hours
toward the project.

tation as a company that cares, turn to the end of the chapter and read the It’s a

When you hear about Hampton taking responsibility to improve the communities where its ho-
tels are located, doesn’t that make you feel good about deciding to sleep there? You don’t have
to think hard to discover lots of other corporations and organizations trying to make their audi-
ences feel good about their brand and gain the goodwill of the public, which is one objective of
public relations. We focus our discussion in this chapter on the role of public relations in an or-
ganization, exploring how goodwill can be used effectively in a marketing communication pro-
gram. You’ll read about the types of PR programs, planning, and tools, and also about gauging
their effectiveness.
WHAT IS PUBLIC RELATIONS?
Public relations is a fundamental communication discipline covering a wide range of functions
that help an organization connect with the people it touches. Those functions include internal re-
lations, publicity, advertising, press agentry, public affairs, lobbying, issues management, in-
vestor relations, and development.
Public relations is used to generate goodwill for an organization. That mission is as broad in
scope as the definition suggests: “Public relationsis the management function that establishes
and maintains mutually beneficial relationships between an organization and the publics on
whom its success or failure depends.”1Afield that is rapidly changing and growing, public rela-
tions is increasingly used to build and maintain reciprocal relationships through dialogue and
two-way communication in our networked society.
Public relations focuses on all the relationships an organization has with its various publics.
Bypublics,we mean all the groups of people with which a company or organization interacts:
employees, members, customers, local communities, shareholders, other institutions, and society
at large. Another term for this is stakeholders,which refers more specifically to people who have
a stake, financial or otherwise, in a company or organization. In the Hampton case, the “Save-A-
Landmark” campaign reaches multiple publics, including the residents of the areas where the ho-
tels are located, travelers, and its employees.
Public relations is practiced by a wide range of organizations—companies, governments,
trade and professional associations, nonprofit organizations, the travel and tourism industry, ed-
ucational systems, labor unions, politicians, organized sports, and the media. Most organizations
have in-house public relations departments that handle the organizations’public relations work,
although many also hire outside public relations agencies. Public relations is a dynamic, global

profession. One organization, The Global Alliance for Public Relations and Communications
Management, represents 160,000 pros in about 70 countries. Find out more about this group at
www.globalalliancepr.org.
On one level, public relations is a tactical function in that PR staff produce a variety of com-
munication tools to achieve corporate image objectives. On a higher level, it is a management
function that monitors public opinion and advises senior corporate managers on how to achieve
positive relationships with various audiences (publics) to effectively manage the organization’s
image and reputation. Its publics may be external (customers, the news media, the investment
community, the general public, government bodies) and internal (shareholders, employees).
Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPPGroup, one of the largest advertising and marketing services
groups in the world, believes that “public relations and public affairs are probably higher up on
the CEO’s agenda than advertising, market research, or other forms of specialist communication.”
As Sorrell notes, public relations practitioners have “access to the CEO’s office,” which can give
them more influence on corporate policies.2
Public Opinion
Public relations programs are built on an understanding of public opinion on issues critical to the
organization, such as the company’s impact on the environment and its local community or work-
ers’rights and how a company deals with its employees. Public opinion,the term describing what
a group of people thinks, expresses beliefs based on their experiences with people, events, insti-
tutions, or products.
The public relations strategist researches the answers to two primary questions about public
opinion to design effective public relations programs. First, which publics are most important to
the organization, now and in the future? Second, what do these publics think? Public opinion is
sometimes confused with mass opinion. Public opinion differs from mass opinion in that public
opinion examines specific subgroups rather than a more general mass audience. Particular em-
phasis falls on understanding the role for each of the publics of opinion leaders,important peo-
ple who influence the opinions of others
Reputation: Goodwill, Trust, and Integrity
Public goodwill is the greatest asset any organization can have. Awell-informed public with a
positive attitude toward an organization is critical to the organization’s survival—and that is why
creating goodwill is the primary goal of most public relations programs.
Sometimes a totally unexpected crisis can threaten an organization’s respect and trust. For
example, managers at Domino’s Pizza had to deal with two employees in a North Carolina store
who thought it would be funny to post a YouTube video of themselves messing with ingredients—
think “mozzarella curl in the nostril” and “sneezing on a salami.” It wasn’t real funny to the com-
pany when it had to place ads nationwide apologizing for the antics of the two.3
Beyond responding to immediate issues, a public relations program that is tuned to creating

lic relations organizations have created codes of ethics, which encourage ethical behavior of in-
dustry members. The Public Relations Society of America’s Code of Professional Standards for
the Practice of Public Relationsspells out core values of conduct, such as truth, accuracy, fair-
ness, and responsibility to the public. It also includes specific provisions regarding the free flow
of information, fair competition, disclosure of information, protection of confidential and private
information, and avoidance of conflicts of interest.5Other industry organizations, such as the In-
ternational Association of Business Communicators (IABC) and the Council of Public Relations
Firms, offer similar codes.
It is critical for public relations professionals to act ethically. It is equally important for the
clients and organizations they represent to act with integrity. The trust on which goodwill is based
comes from corporate integrity. One communication expert who has experience with multinational

yourself. The value of a good reputation is difficult to measure. Although considered a soft asset,one
that is not usually included in a company’s financial statement, it can be significant in determin-
ing company and brand value. The lack of a good reputation can be devastatingly costly, as British
Petroleum discovered after weeks, even months, of trying to deal with an oil leak in the Gulf of
Mexico and its decision to reimburse businesses harmed by the spill.
Comparing Public Relations and Advertising
Designing ads, preparing written messages, and buying time or space are the key concerns of ad-
vertisers. Their objective is to create the consumer awareness and motivation that deliver sales.
The goal of public relations specialists is communicating with various stakeholders, managing
the organization’s image and reputation, creating positive public attitudes, and building strong re-
lationships between the organization and its constituents.
Ultimately, the difference between advertising and public relations is that public relations
takes a longer, broader view of the importance of image and reputation as a corporate competi-
tive asset and addresses more target audiences. Public relations and advertising also differ in how
they use the media, the level of control they have over message delivery, and their perceived cred-
ibility. Daniel Edelman, founder and chairman of Daniel J. Edelman, Inc., a major public rela-
tions firm, describes this as the “golden age of public relations,” in part because of the many ways
PR engages with its publics who are active participants in the
communication process.8Here are some specific differences
between public relations and advertising:
• Media UseIn contrast to buying advertising time and
space, public relations people seek to persuade media
gatekeepers to carry stories about their company.
Gatekeepersinclude writers, producers, editors, talk-
show coordinators, and newscasters. Although public re-
lations has a distinguished tradition, people often
mistake it for publicity,which refers to getting news
media coverage. Publicity, however, is focused on the
news media and their audiences, which is just one aspect
of public relations, and it carries no direct media costs.
Even when public relations uses paid-for media like ad-
vertising, the message focuses on the organization, with
little or no attempt to sell a brand or product line.
• ControlIn the case of news stories, the public relations
strategist is at the mercy of the media gatekeeper. There
is no guarantee that all or even part of a story will ap-
pear. PR writers write the story, send it to the media, and
cross their fingers that this story will appear. In fact,
there is the real risk that a story may be rewritten or re-
organized by an editor so that it no longer means what
the strategist intended. In contrast, advertising runs ex-
actly as the client who paid for it has approved and it
runs as scheduled.
• CredibilityThe public tends to trust the media more than
they do advertisers. This consumer tendency to confer

CHAPTER 15 • PUBLIC RELATIONS 463
Relations,observes that today’s sophisticated and skeptical consumers know when they are
being informed and when they are being “sold to.” He explains, “PR closes the marketing
credibility gap because it is the one marketing communication tool devoted to providing in-
formation, not salesmanship.”9
In a recent study researchers found that a media placement has about the same effectiveness
as advertising. Contrary to the oft-repeated assumption that editorial coverage generates more
value than equivalent advertising, they did not find that PR scored higher on most of the mea-
sures: brand recognition, message believability, overall interest, or consumer preference.10
Another way to build credibility is through corporate social responsibility.John Paluszek,
senior counsel at Ketchum, an expert in the area of public relations corporate social responsi-
bility, and a member of our advisory board, says, “One of the great growth areas for PR is cor-
porate social responsibility/sustainable development/corporate citizenship.”11 Many examples
confirm this trend of doing well by doing good. For example, Bill Gates’philanthropic efforts
boosted public opinion of Microsoft and generated goodwill for his corporation in the process.
General Electric’s Ecomagination campaign helps raise awareness of sustainability issues
(http://ge.ecomagination.com). The Pepsi Refresh Project aims to raise at least $20 million for
donations to local organizations and causes proposed by the public in health, arts and culture,
the environment, and education.12Often these efforts use advertising to accomplish their public
relations goals.
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES
OF PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAMS?
The word relationsinpublic relationsrefers to relationships with various stakeholders. In fact,
the main subspecialties in the field—public affairs, media relations, employee relations, and fi-
nancial relations—call attention to important relationships with such groups as the general pub-
lic, media, employees, and the financial community. Figure 15.1outlines the various publics, or
stakeholders, for a multinational company. The term relationship marketingintroduces a point
of view in marketing planning that evolved from public relations.13
The key publics addressed by relationship programs in public relations are the media, em-
ployees, members, shareholders and others in the financial community, government, and general
public. Here are the specialty areas that focus on these relationship programs:
• Media RelationsThe area that focuses on developing media contacts—that is, knowing who
in the media might be interested in the organization’s story—is called media relations.
When you say public relations,most people immediately think about publicity, which indi-
cates the importance of this media function. The organization initiates publicity and provides
pertinent information to the media. Asuccessful relationship between a public relations per-
son and editors and producers is built on a PR person’s reputation for honesty, accuracy, and
professionalism. Once this reputation is tarnished or lost, the public relations person cannot
function effectively as a liaison between a company and the media.
• Employee RelationsPrograms that communicate information to employees are called
employee relations.This function may belong to public relations, although it may also be
the responsibility of human resources. Arelated program is called internal marketing,
which deals with communication efforts aimed at informing employees about marketing
programs and encouraging their support.
• Financial RelationsAll the communication efforts aimed at the financial community, such
as press releases sent to business publications, meetings with investors and analysts, and the
annual report, which the federal government requires of publicly held companies, are re-
ferred to as financial relations.
• Public AffairsCorporate communication programs with government and with the public on
issues related to government and regulation are called public affairs.For example, a com-
pany building a new plant may need to gain the approval of government health and public
safety regulators. Public affairs also includes lobbying. Lobbyingoccurs when a company
provides information to legislators to get their support and vote on a particular bill. It also

includes communication efforts with consumer or activist groups that seek to influence gov-
ernment policies. Issue managementis another term for this function. In addition to gov-
ernment relations, public affairs programs also monitor public opinion about issues central
to the organization’s interest and develop programs to communicate to and with the public
about these issues.
• RecruitmentPublic relations professionals are sometimes involved in employee recruitment,
working with human resources and also membership recruitment for organizations. This
may involve preparing ads, websites, and literature on the company or organization, as well
as arranging events.

• Cause MarketingWhen companies, such as Hampton Hotels, associate themselves with a
good cause by providing assistance and financial support, the practice is called cause mar-
keting.This topic, along with the related areas of nonprofit marketing, public communica-
tion campaigns, social marketing, and mission marketing, will be discussed in more detail in
Chapter 18. Häagen-Dazs’association with the disappearance of honeybee colonies, which
was described in the opening case of Chapter 3, is an example of cause marketing.

ment, marketing public relations, and public communication campaigns are distinctive because of

can gain experience while you’re in school, as these students did. See The
Inside Story by Mark Thomson at www.pearsonhighered.com/moriarty
for an example of an unusual career that relates to public relations.
Corporate Reputation Management The area that focuses on an orga-
nization’s image and reputation is called corporate relations.The over-
riding goal of reputation managementin a corporate relations program
is to strengthen the trust that stakeholders have in an organization. Pub-
lic relations expert Fraser Seitel offers advice about the importance of
managing corporate image in The Practice of Public Relations:
Most organizations today understand that corporate image is a fragile
commodity, and to improve that image they must operate with the
“implicit trust” of the public. That means that for a corporation in the
21st century, winning favorable public opinion isn’t an option—it’s a
necessity, essential for continued long-term success.14
Since corporate reputation is a perception, it is earned through
deeds, not created by advertising. Starbucks and Walmart offer examples
of corporations working hard to create positive perceptions. Cause mar-
keting, which we just mentioned, is one way corporations demonstrate
their social responsibility.
Starbucks is battling misperceptions that characterize it as a cor-
porate giant with a media- and consumer-focused PR initiative called
“Starbucks Shared Planet,” which you can read about on its website
(www.starbucks.com). The program shows Starbucks’efforts in the areas
of ethical sourcing, environmental stewardship, and community involve-
ment. Visitors to the interactive site are even offered the opportunity to
customize their own global responsibility report.
Walmart, one of the world’s biggest companies with more than $400
billion in annual sales, also faces the challenge of maintaining a positive
image. Walmart’s corporate website explains its efforts to be a good cor-
porate citizen (go to www.walmart.com, then click on “Corporate Web-
site”). You can read about its commitments to the disaster relief efforts
for Haiti and Chile earthquake victims, to employing veterans, to build-
ing sustainability, and to improving health and wellness. One story de-

the possibility of a disaster and plan how to deal with the bad news and
all the affected publics. Toyota’s recall of defective cars in 2010, cyanide-
laced Tylenol (a classic case from 1982), and the 2010 BPDeepwater Horizon oil disaster are all
examples of crises that public relations professionals would handle, or at least consult with the
corporations’top executives. Tiger Woods’admission of infidelity caused a crisis for the brands
like Gatorade, Gillette, and Accenture who’d hired him as a spokesperson.

Public Communication Campaigns Used as a way to change public opinion, public communi-
cation campaignsalso discourage socially harmful behaviors, such as driving in areas with high
levels of air pollution. Sometimes they are engaged in counter marketing as they try to argue
against other advertising messages. For example, the Florida truth®campaign by the Porter Nov-
elli agency was designed to counter big tobacco companies’advertising that appeals to teenagers.
The strategy was to get young people to rebel against the tobacco industry. An extension of that
campaign by Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky featured teens in one award-winning commercial piling
body bags outside Phillip Morris’s New York headquarters. The campaign produced the largest
single-year decline in teen smoking in nearly 20 years.
Taken to the global level, public diplomacy is public relations writ large. President Obama
and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton manifest efforts to promote the United States’interests in-
ternationally. You can read about a public communication campaign to change public opinion
about the war in Iraq in the A Matter of Principlebox.
Marketing Public Relations One area where advertising and public relations overlap is
marketing public relations (MPR).Tom Harris, author of The Marketer’s Guide to Public Re-
lations,says MPR is the fastest growing area of public relations. He defines MPR as the process
of planning and delivering programs that encourage sales and contribute to customer satisfaction
by providing communication that addresses the needs and wants of consumers.
MPR is different from a more general public relations approach in its consumer, brand, and
sales focus. However, the need to establish a credibility platform is similar in both; that’s what
PR brings to marketing and is PR’s greatest strength in an integrated marketing communication
program. In other words, MPR supports marketing’s product and sales focus by increasing the
brand’s credibility with consumers.

WHAT KEY DECISIONS GUIDE PUBLIC RELATIONS PLANS?
Planning for a public relations campaign is similar to planning an advertising or IMC campaign.
The plan should complement the marketing and marcom strategies so the organization commu-
nicates with one clear voice to its various publics. The plan also identifies the various key publics
and the public relations activities that PR people use to address the interests of its various publics.
In addition to identifying key targets, public relations plans also specify the objectives that give
direction to the PR program or campaign. Assessing the effectiveness of the campaign in achiev-
ing its objectives is important, just as it is for advertising campaigns.
Research and SWOT Analysis
Research is used by an organization, as well as outside PR agencies, throughout the planning and
implementation of a PR plan. It’s also used afterward to determine if the effort was successful and
if the organization is spending its money wisely on the public relations efforts.
The PR effort may also begin with a more formal type of background research, called a
communication auditto assess the internal and external PR environment that affects the orga-
nization’s audiences, objectives, competitors, and past results. An annual audit or a campaign-
specific audit can be used to ensure that a program is on track and performing as intended. Often
benchmarkingis used to identify baselines from previous audits or audits of other related com-
panies and industries so there is a point of comparison. Agap analysis,which measures the dif-
ferences in perceptions and attitudes between groups or between the organization and its publics,
may be part of the analysis.

Since public opinion is so central to public relations programs, companies often use ongo-
ing research to monitor opinions and attitudes. The Porter Novelli agency annually tracks Amer-
ican institutions’credibility and consumers’concerns about such topics as health, nutrition, and
their lifestyles. The agency suggests that such information is useful in identifying people’s ori-
entation to health messages. It’s also helpful in targeting various types of publics based on their
general attitudes toward key issues, such as antismoking. The survey has consistently found that
the credibility of institutions such as government, the media, and corporations is declining.
As in marketing or advertising planning, a PR plan begins with background research lead-
ing to a situation analysis, or SWOTanalysis, that evaluates a company’s strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats. This analysis reflects a general understanding of the difficulty of
changing people’s attitudes about issues such as corporations and their role in protecting the en-
vironment. Understanding the nature of the problem makes it easier to determine the appropriate
communication objectives and the target stakeholder audiences, or publics, who will be addressed
by the PR efforts. In public relations planning, the situation analysis can include such topics as
changes in public opinion, industry and consumer trends, economic trends, governmental regu-
lations and oversight programs, and corporate strategies that affect a company’s relationships
with stakeholders.
Targeting
As in other marketing communication areas, it is important to understand the target audience be-
fore designing the campaign. Research is conducted to identify the appropriate publics to which
to address the public relations message. When Hampton Hotels asked Americans their opinions,
they found that 9 out of 10 people believed that roadside landmarks should be saved and that most
of those surveyed, 83 percent, thought that corporations should share the responsibility for doing
so. Creating the “Save-A-Landmark” campaign was a natural connection between consumers and
the innkeeper, and research provided a key insight.
CHAPTER 15 • PUBLIC RELATIONS 469
Objectives and Strategies
Avariety of objectives guides a PR plan, and the organization can use myriad strategies to carry
out the plan. Public relations objectives are designed by PR planners to make changes in the pub-
lic’s knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to a company, brand, or organization. Usually,
these objectives focus on creating credibility, delivering information, and building positive im-
ages, trust, and corporate goodwill.
Acompany may also seek to change behavior, but that is a difficult task. Before changing
behavior, a communication effort may need to change people’s beliefs, attitudes, and feelings. In
many PR efforts, these communication effects are easier to accomplish and measure than behav-
ior change. Typical public relations objectives include:
• Creating a corporate or organization brand
• Shaping or redefining a corporate reputation

other stakeholders. Regardless of the reason for change,
“communication with principal stakeholders ranks high in
the hierarchy of factors that predict success. Communication
is second only to the main stakeholders’participation in the
process.”18
Involvement Strategies Public relations uses participation
to intensify stakeholder involvement with a company or
brand. Involvement can create interest and a feeling of ex-
citement, but more importantly it can drive loyalty. Getting
people to participate in an action plan is one way to drive be-
havior change. For example, Pizza Hut’s “Book It” effort is
an incentive program used by schools to offer free pizzas to
reward students for reading.
The Big Idea
Creative ideas are just as important in public relations as in
advertising—and for the same reason: to get attention. The
Clark County Desert Conservation Program in Nevada wanted
to promote desert environments and threats to their ecology.

just like Punxsutawney Phil does in the East. Who would have

PR stunts designed to get publicity are also
part of the promotional arsenal. Janet Jackson’s
big exposure during the 2004 Super Bowl half-
time show is an example of a stunt that got lots of
visibility for the performer. Critics say the over-
exposure was in poor taste, but other PR experts
say it was an example of a stunt that will be
talked about for years. Jackson also gathered
twice the number of U.S. press mentions as the
Super Bowl commercials did that year.19Denny’s

PR’s Role in IMC
In integrated programs, advertising and public relations aim at selected targets with different but
complementary messages. Note that the term strategic communication is more often used than
IMC in public relations programs. As one researcher observed, “In IMC, company assets and
product assets are managed at the same time.”23In many companies, advertising and public rela-
tions are separate, uncoordinated functions. People working in public relations are often trained
as journalists, with little background in marketing, and they focus on corporate image rather than
product sales. These different orientations can sometimes create inconsistencies in an organiza-
tion’s communication efforts.
Public relations uses a variety of marketing communication tools just as advertising does.
Advertising is particularly useful in corporate image and reputation programs. Direct marketing
is sometimes useful in sending out corporate books and DVDs. The Internet is important because
the corporate website is one of the primary ways to disseminate information about an organiza-
tion. PR activities, such as publicity and special mailings of DVDs, can help drive traffic to the
corporate website. Sales promotion is used in support of PR activities, such as special events. In
some cases, it’s hard to know whether an event is a sales promotion or public relations effort.
But it’s not just the use of these tools that makes PR a viable IMC function, it’s also the fact that
PR can contribute valuable effects, such as credibility.

and new opportunities are emerging for public relations,
publicity, and product placements to be integral parts of in-
tegrated marketing communication programs One way that
advertising and PR have worked together is in the Ad Coun-
cil’s work, such as the classic Smokey the Bear campaign.
WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON
TYPES OF PUBLIC RELATIONS TOOLS?
The public relations practitioner has many tools, which we
can divide into two categories: controlled media and uncon-
trolled media. Controlled media include house ads, public
service announcements, corporate (institutional) advertising,
in-house publications, and visual presentations. The sponsor-
ing organizations pay for these media. In turn, the sponsor
maintains total control over how and when the message is de-
livered. Uncontrolled media include press releases, press
conferences, and media tours. The most recent new media are
electronic, which might be categorized as semi-controlled
media.Corporations and businesses control their own web-
sites, for example, but other websites (particularly those that
are set up by critics and disgruntled ex-employees), blogs,

and chat rooms about the company are not controlled.

company. Word of mouth, or buzz, is important to PR pro-
grams because of the persuasive power of personal conver-
sation. PR programs, particularly employee communication programs, may be designed to
influence what people say about the company, but ultimately the comments are outside the com-
pany’s control. Table 15.1summarizes these tools.

Advertising
Public relations programs sometimes employ advertising as a way to create corporate visibility
or strengthen relationships with its various stakeholder audiences. The primary uses of advertis-
ing are house ads, public service announcements, and corporate advertising.

Public Service Announcements The ads for charitable and civic organizations that run free of
charge on television or radio or in print media are called public service announcements (PSAs).
The United Way, the American Heart Association, the Greater Chicago Food Depository (see the
accompanying ad), and local arts councils all rely on PSAs. These ads are prepared just like other
print ads or commercials, and in most instances ad agencies donate their expertise and media do-
nate time and space to run the ads.

ognizedefforts.Anotherclassicisthe“Pollution:KeepAmericaBeautiful”campaignfeaturedhere.
Getting donated time and space is not easy. The PSAdirectors at various media receive a bar-
rage of public service campaigns every week on different issues, and they must choose which ones
to run. There is no guarantee which markets will see the campaign elements, and there is no guar-
antee that the same people will see the print and TVversions of a campaign. Some PSAcampaigns
do not get any airtime or print placements.
Studies of PSAeffectiveness can help guide nonprofit organizations. For instance, a look at
PSAs to combat drunk driving, particularly among the college population, found that the usual
anti–drunk-driving messages are not as relevant to this audience as they might be. They do not
address the students’greatest fear: being pulled over and charged with a DUI. The study also
found that a localized PSA, one that mentions or uses a local community angle, is more mean-
ingful to the college-age group.25
Professor Herb Rotfeld recognizes that many cam-
paigns have produced effective PSAs to help address social
ills in the A Principled Practice box. Yet he questions
whether these campaigns alone can solve the social prob-
lems they seek to address, especially considering their de-
pendency on the generosity of media outlets to offer free
time and space. PSAs can help make people aware of social
problems, but they may not eliminate them.
SHOWCASE
Matt Miller, art director at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners,
explained the strategy behind this ad for the Greater Chicago
Food Depository. “Even though it may be hard to hear, the
truth is, people are skeptical of charities these days. The
Greater Chicago Food Depository wanted to stand out among
the rest. [It wanted] to reassure Chicagoans that the food
and money they donate goes to other less fortunate
Chicagoans. And that’s why we created the “Fight Empty
Plates” campaign.”

other groups depend on time or space donated by that advertising alone is the solution.
Corporate Advertising With corporate advertising,a company focuses on its corporate im-
age or viewpoint. There is less emphasis on selling a particular product unless it is tied in to a
good cause. For that reason, the ad or other campaign materials may originate in the public rela-
tions department rather than the advertising department.
An example of corporate advertising that is tied to a socially redeeming program is the Tar-
get Guest Card. To increase use of the credit card, the Martin/Williams agency of Minneapolis
had to find a compelling reason for people to shop at Target and use the card. Target’s typical cus-
tomer is female, ages 25 to 54, and her most important concern is her family. The agency team
proposed a “Take Charge of Education” campaign, a simple fund-raising program for local
schools tied to use of the Target Guest Card. One percent of the value of the purchases made with
the card would go to a qualifying K–12 school of the cardholder’s choice. The fund-raising pro-
gram for schools showcases Target’s commitment to education, an area of great importance to
Target customers. So far Target has given more than $273 million to schools.26It gives 5 percent
of its income—$3 million—to communities every week.
Corporate identity advertisingis another type of advertising that firms use to enhance or
maintain their reputation among specific audiences or to establish a level of awareness of the com-
pany’s name and the nature of its business. “The Johnson & Johnson Campaign for Nursing’s
474 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
Future” celebrates the profession and helps recruit and retain nurses in one of
its initiatives. Companies that have changed their names, such as Accenture
(formerly Andersen Consulting), have also used corporate identity advertising.
Sometimes companies deliver point-of-view messages called advocacy
advertising. General Electric’s Ecomagination campaign that we mentioned
before, for example, shows that the company wants to be a caretaker of the en-
vironment and is creating products in line with that philosophy. Another ex-
ample comes from Procter & Gamble. Following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil
spill P&G recognized that many animals are injured or killed by the 24 million
gallons of oil that typically pollute North American waters each year. In re-
sponse it created a campaign for Dawn liquid dishwashing detergent . The soap,
known to be tough on grease, yet gentle, connects naturally with the advocacy
effort to rescue birds and marine mammals harmed by oil spills. Dawn’s
“Everyday Wildlife Champions” campaign aims to inspire people to get in-
volved.27Dawn urges consumers to go to www.dawnsaveswildlife.comto enter
numbers printed on the back of bottles, which triggers a $1 donation from Proc-
ter & Gamble to wildlife groups. Consumers can also volunteer to help wildlife
causes via Facebook.
Dawn’s environmental cause-related campaign proved particularly timely
in light of the massive BPoil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Donating more

behalf of a company or brand. Human footwear maker Teva created sandals for
an Asian elephant with foot problems. The result was an article and photo that ran as a news items.
PR expert Tom Harris calls this type of media coverage “an endorsement that money can’t buy.”29
Media relations is often seen as the most important core competency for PR professionals.
Media relations specialists know media that would be interested in stories about their companies.
They also develop personal contacts with reporters and editors who write regularly on topics
related to their organization’s industry. As Carole Howard, author of a media relations book, ex-
plains, “Good media contacts proliferate once they are established.”30In addition to personal con-
tact, the primary tool used in media relations is the news release, along with press conferences
and media tours.
News Releases Thenews releaseis the primary medium used to deliver public relations mes-
sages to the various external media. Although the company distributing the news release controls
its original form and content, the media decide what to present and how to present it. What the
public finally sees, then, is not necessarily what the originating company had in mind, and so this
form of publicity offers less control to the originating company.
The decision to use any part of a news release is based on an editor’s judgment of its news
value.News valueis based on such considerations as timeliness (something just happened or
is about to happen), proximity (a local angle), impact (importance or significance), or human
interest.
News releases must be written differently for each medium, accommodating space and time
limitations. Traditional journalism form is followed, which means the 5Wformat is standard—in
other words, the release should lead with answers to questions of who, what, why, when, where,
and how. The more carefully the news release is planned and written, the better the chance it has
of being accepted and published as written. Note the tight and simple writing style in the news
release from global public relations and communication firm Weber Shandwick.
The news release can be delivered in a number of ways—in person, by local deliveryservice,
by mail, by fax, or by e-mail. Sometimes a company is hired that specializes in distribution, such
as the U.S. Newswire. Originally these companies sent news releases by mail or delivery services,

but today news releases are more likely to be distributed electronically through satellite and Web-
based networks. PR Newswire, U.S. Newswire, and BusinessWire are services that provide tar-
geted distribution to special-interest media outlets or handle mass distribution of news releases,
photos,graphics, video, audio, and other materials. If your organization decides to use e-mail, here
is a set of guidelines for delivery:31
• Use one reporters name and address per “to” line.
• Keep subject line header simple.
• Boldface“FOR IMMMEDIATE RELEASE” on the first line above the date.
• Catch attention with a good headline.
• Limit length (shorter than print’s 500-word limit).
• Use the 5Wformat.
• Do not include attachments.
• Link to a URLwhere other background information and photos are posted.
• Remember readability and use short paragraphs, bullets, numbers, and lists to keep it scannable.
• Put contact information below the text.
• Close with conventional end signs such as “30” or “######.”
476 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
Video news releases (VNRs)contain video footage for a television newscast. They are ef-
fective because they show target audiences the message in two different video environments: first
as part of a news report and then reused later in an advertisement. Of course, there is no guaran-
tee that a VNR will be used. One study found that VNRs aired in the Miami market were used be-
cause they had high visual quality and simple stories.32 The online video channel Skype also
offers a new way to deliver VNRs.
Pitch Letters Ideas for feature stories,which are human interest stories rather than hard news
announcements, have to be “sold” to editors. This is done using a pitch letterthat outlines the
subject in an engaging way and sells a story idea. Companies use this form to feature interesting
research breakthroughs, employees, or corporate causes. Not only is the distribution of press re-
leases moving online, so are the letters pitching editors with story ideas. Ragan Communications,
publisher of Interactive Public Relations, lists some tips for getting reporters and editors to read
e-mail pitch letters in the Practical Tipsbox.
Press Conferences Apress conference—an event at which a company spokesperson makes a
statement to media representatives—is one of the riskiest public relations activities because the
media may not see the company’s announcement as being real news. Companies often worry
about whether the press will show up for a press conference. Will they ask the right questions, or
will they ask questions the company cannot or does not want to answer?
To encourage reporters to cover press conferences, companies may issue a media kit,usu-
ally a folder that provides all important background information to members of the press, either
before or when they arrive at the press conference. The risk in offering media kits (also called
press kits) is that they give reporters all of the necessary information so that the press conference
itself becomes unnecessary.
Media Tours Amedia touris a press conference on wheels. The traveling spokesperson makes
announcements and speeches, holds press conferences to explain a promotional effort, and offers
interviews.
Publications
Organizations may provide employees and other publics with pamphlets, booklets, annual re-
ports, books, bulletins, newsletters, inserts and enclosures, and position papers.

The Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) requires that each publicly held company
publish an annual report.Acompany’s annual
report is targeted to investors and may be the sin-
gle most important document the company dis-
tributes. Millions of dollars are spent on the
editing and design of annual reports. These re-
ports are especially important to stockholders
and potential investors.
Some companies publish material in print or
online, often called collateral material,to support
their marketing public relations efforts. Corporate
publications, marketing, and sales promotion de-
partments and their agencies also produce training
materials and sales kits to support particular cam-
paigns. Think about the high-quality brochures

making it available for others to publish on their
own sites as well. The site doesn’t like overtly
promotional content, but a company can provide a service piece related to its business—any kind
of “how-to” piece is welcome. For example, if you have a client that does faux painting, a gen-
eral article on the art of faux painting and how to use it as a design element can also carry a short
bio and link to your client’s site.
Other Tools
In addition to advertising, publicity, and publications, public relations practitioners have various
other types of materials and activities in their professional toolkits.
DVDs, CDs, Podcasts, Books, and Online Video DVDs and podcasts have become major pub-
lic relations tools for many companies. Corporate books have also become popular with the ad-
vent of simplified electronic publication. Costing $1,000 to $2,000 per minute to make, videos
are not inexpensive. However, they are an ideal tool for distributing in-depth information about
a company or program. Because they are easier to duplicate, DVDs are reducing this cost. Some
companies have taken stock of the YouTube phenomenon and are using online video to reduce
costs and draw attention to messages on corporate websites. Monsanto, for example, posted video
clips of testimonials from farmers using Monsanto products on its site, hoping to attract cus-
tomers, employees, and policy makers.
Speakers and Photos Many companies have a speakers’ bureauof articulate people who will
talk about topics at the public’s request. Organizations as varied as Apple Computer, Harvard Uni-
versity, and the Children’s Hospital in Houston, Texas, all have speakers’bureaus that can arrange
presentations to local groups and classes.
Some publics, particularly the news media, may want pictures of people, products, places, and
events. That’s why PR departments maintain files of photographs that are accurate, up to date, and well
composed. The permissions for ads in this book were provided because they present the advertisers in
a positive light. Companies seldom give permission to use ads that authors intend to criticize.
Displays and Exhibits Displays and exhibits, along with special events and tours, may be im-
portant parts of both sales promotion and public relations programs. Displays include signage and
478 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
booths, racks, and holders for promotional literature. Amodel of a new condominium complex,
complete with a literature rack offering brochures about its development, is an example of a dis-
play. Exhibits tend to be larger than displays; they may have moving parts, sound, or video and
usually are staffed by a company representative. Booth exhibits are important at trade shows,
where some companies may take orders for much of their annual sales.
Special Events and Tours Some companies stage events to celebrate milestones, such as key
anniversaries and introductions of new products. Toy company Mattel celebrated Barbie’s
50th birthday by re-releasing a dozen retired models to celebrate different eras, such as Bar-
bie in 1970s bell bottoms and as an 80s rocker with a spiky pink wig. Her birthday party in-
cluded an appearance at New York’s Fashion Week with outfits designed by top fashion
designers.33
These are high-visibility activities designed to get maximum publicity. Special events can
be the public relations manager’s responsibility as well as a sales promotion activity. The use of
fancy staged events has seen the most growth. Corporate sponsorship of various sporting events
like golf tournaments and car races has evolved into a favorite public relations tactic.
Nonprofits also use events as promotional opportunities. For example, the American Mu-
seum of Natural History used a coordinated, branded media event to announce the unveiling of a
47-million-year-old fossil. The event was timed to coincide with an article in a scientific journal,
as well as a History Channel film, a book release, an exclusive news arrangement with ABC, and
a website.34
Thomas Harris, cofounder of Golin/Harris Communications, considers Steve Jobs to be one of
the world’s greatest public relations people. When Jobs took the stage to announce the Apple iPhone,
the product launch generated an estimated $400 million in free
publicity. According to Harris, by the time the iPhone went on
sale six months later, it had already been the subject of 11,000
print articles and had generated 69 million hits on Google for
what bloggers were calling the “Jesus phone.” Jobs repeated
the feat with the announcement of Apple’s iPad, generating
lots of buzz for its new tablet. Harris also had to do damage
control with a large press conference when the new iPhone 4
was panned for its antenna problems.
Events can also be important for internal communica-
tion. Learning objectives and employee buy-in for a new
campaign are often accomplished through meetings, semi-
nars, and workshops sponsored by a company, typically in
conjunction with training materials and other publications.
To facilitate internal marketing, town hall forumsare some-
times used. Forums provide management with an opportu-
nity to make a presentation on some major project, initiative,
or issue and invite employees to discuss it.

Online Communication
PR practitioner and author Fraser Seitel says, “While it is
irrefutable that the Internet and social media have changed
communication forever with newfound immediacy and perva-
siveness, it isn’t the case that the Internet has replaced human
relationships as the essence of societal communications. Nor

tools available to marketing communicators and particu-

External Communication As a workshop conference on the Web’s usefulness in public rela-
tions notes, “The World Wide Web can be considered the first public relations mass medium in
that it allows managed communication directly between organizations and audiences without the
gatekeeping function of other mass media.”37Hampton Hotels involved the public by letting peo-
ple learn about the landmark project and vote directly on which landmarks should be refurbished
on its website (www.hamptonlandmarks.com).
Corporate websites have become an important part of corporate communication. These sites
can present information about the company and open up avenues for stakeholders to contact the
company. Website newsrooms distribute a company’s press releases to the media and other inter-
ested stakeholders. One study noted that the Web’s interactive dimension is particularly impor-
tant: “If you build a highly interactive and informative website, then you can capitalize on
building brand and corporate image through longer and more intense exposures than any other
type of campaign.” The study also found that interactivity—being able to contact the company—
is more important than the actual information.38
In addition to websites, the Internet has become the favorite tool of media relations profes-
sionals as well as journalists. Furthermore, most press releases are now distributed online either
by sending them directly to reporters or to such services as PR Newswire, which then handles
mass distribution online to appropriate publications.
Internal Communication E-mail is a great way for people at separate worksites to communi-
cate. You can get a fast reply if people on the other end are checking their mail regularly. It is also
an inexpensive form of internal communication. Internal company e-mail may have its public re-
lations downside, however. It can be used in court. Some of the most damaging evidence the fed-
eral government presented against Microsoft in its antitrust suit in 1998 came from e-mail
messages exchanged within the company.

Internal company networks have great benefits. Intranets and corporate portals (an extensive
collection of databases and links that are important to people working in a company) encourage
communication among employees in general and permit them to share data, such as customer
records and client information. Some companies urge employees to set up personal home pages
as part of the company portal, which allows them to customize the material they receive and set
up their own links to crucial corporate information such as competitor news, product information,
and case histories.
Web Challenges The Internet presents at least as many challenges to public relations professionals
as it does opportunities. Search engine optimization is a major issue for online experts who continu-
ally try to improve the process of key word searching that leads interested Web users to their sites.39
Although the Internet makes it possible to present the company’s image and story without
going through the editing of a gatekeeper, it is much harder to control what is said about the com-
CHAPTER 15 • PUBLIC RELATIONS 481
pany on the Internet. According to Parry Aftab, a lawyer specializing in computer-related issues,
“It used to be that you could control the information because you’d have one spokesman who rep-
resented the company. Now where you have thousands of employees who have access to an e-mail
site, you have thousands of spokesmen.”40All employees have “an inside view” of their company,
whether sanctioned by the PR department or not.
Gossip and rumors can spread around the world within hours. Angry customers and dis-
gruntled former employees know this and have used the Internet to voice their complaints. A
number of these people have set up websites, such as the Official Internet AntiNike website,
alt.destroy.microsft,I Hate McDonald’s, Toys R Us Sucks, GTE Sucks, Why America Online
Sucks, Packard Bell Is Evil, and BallySucks. As a defense against this negative press,
some companies are registering domain names that might cause them trouble. For example,
JP Morgan Chase bank owns IHateChase.com, ChaseStinks.com, and ChaseSucks.com, but
notchasebanksucks.com, which is an active website critical of the company.
When Motrin posted an online ad on a Saturday about mothers who carried their babies in
slings suggesting that this fashion caused back pain, outraged mommy-bloggers and Twitterers
wasted no time calling for boycotts. Makers of Motrin responded by the end of the weekend with
an apology and removed the ad.41
Some companies monitor the Internet to see what is being said about them so they can re-
spond to protect their reputations. Thousands of companies have hired eWatch, a firm that pro-
vides Web monitoring services, to collect such information.
THE BOTTOM LINE
As you’ve seen throughout this chapter, businesses and organizations have many ways to reach
their publics. It’s critical to find a way to break through the media clutter for public relations as
well as advertising messages. Some tips from an article42about how small businesses can com-
municate their messages effectively include:
• Wrap Your Story Around a Bigger IdeaFind a broader context or news hook for your prod-
uct or service and show how your company fits into it.
• Keep It Short and PersonalWhen reaching out to journalists, a few quick sentences via
e-mail,free from industry jargon, explaining who you are and what your business is usually
will suffice. Try to keep the first e-mail readable without having to scroll down. Also, refer-
ring to past works by journalists shows you understand their area of coverage.
• Pay Attention to Web BasicsBuilding a website and getting good rankings on search engines
such as Yahoo! and Google can help customers find businesses, especially new ones. Con-
sider blogging as a way to tell your story and interact with the public. Using sites such as
technorati.comcan help turn up other like-minded bloggers. Podcasting and online video-
sharing sites such as YouTube.comcan help tell your story, but do it creatively, avoiding
purely commercial pitches.
• Host EventsThese don’t have to be expensive, but small themed events with food and drink
for customers can be a good draw, particularly on streets crowded with multiple merchants.
• SeekOutBrandAmbassadorsFindcustomerswillingtotalkupyourproducttoothers,anden-
couragetheirword-of-mouthmarketingwithdiscountsorfirstlooksatnewproductsandsales.
• Publish a NewsletterIt sounds old fashioned, but with so much information coming to peo-
ple online these days, a mailed paper newsletter to customers can seem more personal than
mass e-mails and help your business stand out.
Why Measure Public Relations Results?
As in all marketing communication areas, public relations evaluation is based on setting measur-
able objectives from the beginning of planning. Objectives that specify the impact the program
seeks to have on the various publics can be evaluated by the PR manager if they contain bench-
marks and target levels.
However, measuring the impact of public relations efforts has been difficult. It’s hard to
know what effect clips (or news stories about the company or organization) have on the bottom
line, for example. Catalogs from retailers that feature over-the-top gifts have some value, even if
the items are never sold, because publicity has its own value. The theory is that even consumers
482 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
who don’t purchase the swanky gifts like a $1.8 million Virgin Galactic Charter to Space, avail-
able through Neiman Marcus, still want to be associated with such luxury.43It is also difficult to
separate the effects of public relations from advertising or direct mail. In an effort to solve this
problem, Procter & Gamble has developed an analytic tool to quantify the sales impact of public
relations. In the end, public relations activities need to be evaluated against specific objectives es-
tablished in the public relations plan.
Rapid changes in the media environment further complicate measurement metrics. The Pub-
lic Relations Society of America has convened a group of experts to collaborate and recommend
standardized methods to measure program effectiveness.44
Figure 15.2illustrates that various public relations tactics are controlled, semi-controlled, or
uncontrolled messages. They all play a role in a communication campaign plan. The model iden-
tifies perception, emotion, cognition, persuasion, association, and behavior as categories of ef-
fects that might need to be measured in an evaluation program.
In the past, public relations practitioners have tracked the impact of a campaign in terms of
output (how many news releases led to stories or mentions in news stories) and outcome (attitude
or behavior change). PR firms and companies have hired companies such as BurellesLuce that
specialize in monitoring media coverage. Such tracking and the evaluation of attitude and be-
havior change is done to prove the effectiveness of the PR program, so that they can learn from
their efforts and fine-tune future campaigns. To get a comprehensive picture of PR’s impact, prac-
titioners evaluate process (what goes out) and outcome (media use, effect on the target audience).
Although some still argue that not all the value of public relations programs is measurable,45
others claim that is it possible to increase the use of metrics to determine what impact the cam-

paign is having on sales and business. The public relations community is rethinking the impact
of digital and social media.46Some key concerns are integrating how results from traditional and
new media affect the results of the whole campaign and moving from a mind-set that considers
impressions to one that looks at engagement and conversion rates.
Looking Ahead
This is the first in a set of chapters that focuses on specific marketing communication areas. In
this chapter we reviewed the practice of public relations, as well as its specialty areas, planning
practices, and tools. The next chapter will look at direct-response practices.
IT’S A WRAP
Milestones
for Hampton’s
Landmark Campaign
In this chapter you’ve read about the importance of earning a good reputation. Goodwill is invaluable. But
companies can’t thrive on goodwill alone. It is also essential for an organization to be profitable. The Hamp-
ton Hotels “Save-A-Landmark” campaign achieved its goal of creating awareness, which, in turn, increased
hotel revenue and generated goodwill.
Hampton Hotels earned its good reputation, in part, by becoming a civic-minded industry leader and
helpingrestoremorethan40landmarks,whicharelivingsymbolsofAmericaningenuity,pride,andhistory.
Thiscampaignhelpedstrengthenrelationshipswithitspublics:itsguests,itscommunities,anditsemployees.
Media took notice of these good works, with major news organizations, magazines, and newspapers cov-
ering the Save-A-Landmark project. In 10 years, the program has generated an estimated nearly 5.3 billion in
media impressions and resulted in close to $25 million in ad equivalency for the brand.
Two weeks after the campaign launched, the Save-A-Landmark website generated nearly $70,000 in on-
line bookings and more than $700,000 in its first year. The site has since resulted in more than $3 million of
incremental revenue for the brand.
For these outstanding efforts the “Save-A-Landmark” campaign received much recognition. President
George W. Bush presented the Preserve AmericaPresidential Award to Hampton Hotels. It also received the
National Preservation Honor Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a Silver Anvil, and more
than 75 other industry awards.

He’s Cute; He’s Green; He Sells Insurance
Odds are that you know this little fellow. Maybe you were one of the half-
million people who voted to make the GEICO Gecko one of two favorite
advertising icons. The Gecko’s biography will show you what a far-reaching
impact he’s had on the car insurance business and how direct marketing can suc-
cessfully employ spokes-creatures to replace a sales force.
A subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway corporation, GEICO is the
leading direct-response auto insurer in a category dominated by major brands,
such as Allstate and State Farm. Its biggest marketing challenge is to generate in-
quiries for rate quotes and to motivate people to call or go online to find out
how they can save money, which is reflected in its long-standing brand promise,
“15 minutes could save you 15 percent or more on car insurance.”
ThebirthofTheGecko(that’shiswholename)occurredin1999asadhonchos
atTheMartinAgencylaboredoverwhattodowithanaccounttheyhadforGEICO,
an acronym for the not-so-catchy-sounding Government Employees Insurance
Company. One member of the creative team noted that customers often mispro-
nounced“GEICO”as“Gecko,”andsomeonedrewadoodleofthelittleguy.
The Gecko tells fundamental truths about the human condition in goofy ways.
The oddball humor caught on with the audience, although Ted Ward, vice presi-
dent for marketing for GEICO, admits he didn’t immediately fall in love with the lit-
tle guy. Ward said, “I quickly became much more fond of him as we sold more
policies. I’m a big fan of anything that makes our phone ring or website click. He
really has helped us brandwise.”
Ted Ward described the business: “We have essentially a direct-to-consumer
business model. We try to strip out costs to deliver the lowest price—which in-
cludes having very few agents in a process by having a superior technology model,
which back in the ‘70s was direct mail; in the ‘80s and ‘90s, a telephone; and in the
last 10 years, the online delivery of rates.”
It’s not just GEICO’s endearing icon that makes the campaign work. GEICO
uses The Gecko strategically to accomplish the work that its rival auto insurers do
by hiring an army of sales middlemen.

488 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
You may have noticed that GEICO doesn’t just stick with The Gecko in all of its
commercials. The reason has much to do with the size of the market, which includes
just about anyone who drives a car. Realizing that one creative approach will not
appeal to everyone, GEICO uses a diverse approach to reach a wide audience.
That means The Gecko appeals to some, while the indignant Cavemen capture
others’ attention, and customer testimonials with celebrities like Little Richard
reach even others. Another twist is a campaign dubbed “Rhetorical Questions”
that doesn’t feature any of the company’s mascots. Instead commercials ask rhetor-
ical questions, such as “Does Elmer Fudd have trouble with the letter R?” and “Did
The Waltonstake way too long to say goodnight?”

GEICO’s advertising has had on the industry. Watch competitors’ like State Farm
and Allstate, which have advertised for years with gentle, homespun messages pro-
moting family and security. They are now including more humor, high action, and
other attention-getting techniques to make you remember their brand when it
comes time to buy auto insurance.

Direct marketing is an exciting, dynamic field that is becoming more dominant in marketing
communication because many, if not most, marketers are moving to more interactive forms of
customer communication. Marketers use direct marketing in every consumer and business-to-
business (B2B) category. IBM, Xerox, and other manufacturers selling office products use direct-
response marketing communication, as do almost all banks and insurance companies. Airlines,
hotels, and cruise lines use it. Packaged-goods marketers such as General Foods, Colgate, and
Bristol Myers; household product marketers such as Black and Decker; and automotive compa-
nies use it. Direct marketing shows up in membership drives, fund-raising, and solicitation for
donations by nonprofit organizations such as the Sierra Club and Audubon Society and by polit-
ical associations, so it is also used by other marcom tools, such as public relations.
In this chapter we will discuss the practice and process of direct-response marketing com-
munication (DMC), the key players, the tools of direct marketing, and the principles of integrat-
ing direct marketing into the total brand communication effort.
WHAT IS DIRECT-RESPONSE MARKETING COMMUNICATION?
Why do you suppose marketers continue to use “junk mail” that fills up mailboxes? Or e-mail
spam? Or phone calls by telemarketers? Can these tools possibly be effective?

marketing communication. Because this type of messaging is specifically designed to motivate
an immediate response, it is sometimes also called direct-response marketing. And because DMC
is designed to generate immediate responses, this means it is also easy to tell quickly if the mes-
sages are meeting their objectives. In other words, unlike mass media advertising and public re-
lations, the effects of DMC are more immediate and more measurable.
The Direct Marketing Association is the professional association for this category of mar-
keting communication. We’ll define direct-response marketing as a multichannel system of
marketing that uses a variety of media to connect sellers and customers who deal with each other
directly rather than through an intermediary, such as a wholesaler or retailer. There are two pieces
to the direct marketing business: first, direct marketing relies on communication that is sent in
some form direct to the consumer and, second, the response (sales, sign-up, request for informa-
tion) comes directly back to the source. In both cases there is no intermediary, such as a retailer.
As noted in Figure 16.1, direct marketing includes a strong focus on market research to guide
strategy and database development to better target customers and prospects and invite them to in-
teract with a company. Using an interactive communication model, the contact is designed to
elicit an immediate response, usually a sale, as well as invite customers to contact a company. It
also helps marcom planners listen to what their customers are saying as they respond.

The Direct Marketing Industry
The direct marketing industry begins with research and database development. Its main tools are catalogs, direct mail,
telemarketing, direct-response advertising, the Internet, and other new media.

media eliminate the cost of message delivery—the media cost (although there may still be a cost
for producing these messages).
Direct marketers use a variety of traditional and nontraditional media, including catalogs, direct
mail, telemarketing, mass-media advertising, the Internet, and new forms of media such as cell phones,
smart phones (iPhones, Droids), BlackBerries (personal digital assistants, or PDAs), and social media
such as Facebook and Twitter. Recently direct response has come to mean more than just advertising
as it has expanded into new media that support entertainment platforms and social networks.
Who Are the Key Players?
The four main players in direct-response marketing communication are (1) marketers who use di-
rect response to sell products or services; (2) agencies that specialize in direct-response advertis-
ing; (3) phone, mail, or Internet media that deliver messages; and (4) consumers who are the
recipients of the information and sometimes initiators of the contact.
Marketers Who do you suppose are the biggest users of direct marketing? Traditionally, the
types of companies that have made the greatest use of direct marketing have been book and record
clubs, publishers, insurance companies, sellers of collectibles, and gardening firms.
More recently, computer companies have used the direct-response model effectively. Dell,
for example, has built its business platform on direct marketing of computers directly to con-
sumers rather than through dealers, as its competitors do. This is also true for GEICO.
Why don’t Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM copy the Dell model and sell computers di-
rectly? For one thing, their retail dealers, who deliver big sales to these companies, would retal-
iate if these companies started experimenting with direct sales. Furthermore, it takes a lot of effort
and infrastructure to set up a direct-marketing business. Rather than an army of sales reps, Dell
employs an army of people in fulfillment who take the order, match the product to customer spec-
ifications, handle the money, and arrange for shipping.

AgenciesandMediaCompanies Thefourtypesoffirmsindirect-responseadvertisingincludead-
vertisingagencies,independentdirect-marketingagencies,servicefirms,andfulfillmenthouses:
• Advertising AgenciesMost major agencies whose main business is mass-media advertising
either have a department that specializes in direct response or own a separate direct-response
company. Even if there isn’t a special division or department, the staff of the agency may
still be involved in producing direct marketing pieces.
• Direct Marketing AgenciesIndependent direct marketing agencies create the DMC mes-
sages, arrange for their delivery to a target audience, and evaluate the results.
• Service FirmsService firms specialize in supplying printing, mailing, list brokering, and
data management, as illustrated by the Melissa DATAwebsite near the end of the chapter.
• Fulfillment HousesThis business is responsible for making sure consumers receive whatever
they request in a timely manner, be it a catalog, additional information, or the product itself.
In terms of media, there are also thousands of telemarketing and Web marketing firms that
handle contact with consumers, as well as a variety of other more traditional media companies.
One of the most active direct-mail media organizations, for example, is the U.S. Postal Service.
We’ll discuss these tools later in the section on DMC media.
Customers and Prospects Although people might dislike the intrusiveness of direct-response
advertising, many appreciate the convenience. It is a method of purchasing goods in a society that
is finding itself with more disposable income but with less time to spend it. Anew generation of
consumers armed with push-button phones and a billfold full of credit cards likes to shop from
home. This push-button shopper is joined by an even larger group of mouse-clicking shoppers.
Although it takes some daring to order a product you can’t see, touch, feel, or try out, more and

Objectives and Strategies DMC planning begins by delineating the specific objectives. Direct
marketing can be used to (1) provide in-depth product information, (2) drive traffic to a store or
website, (3) develop leads for or follow-up sales contacts or other direct-response efforts (lead
generation,also called prospecting), (4) drive a response, (5) retain or strengthen customer re-
lationships, and (6) test offers to predict their effectiveness.

donations, memberships, and volunteers. UNICEF, for example, used a creative mailer for its child
soldier campaign. The challenge was to communicate the idea that Africa has the world’s highest
number of child soldiers fighting in wars they don’t believe in for causes they don’t understand.
UNICEF’s goal is to save these kids from war and give them an opportunity to rejoin society. The
Y&R Johannesburg agency in South Africa took on this challenge and developed a direct-response
program that was sent to UNICEF supporter lists, as well as potential corporate sponsors.

Direct marketers make these basic objectives more specific by spelling out such factors as
timing, amount of increase, and the acquisition of information about consumers’specific behav-
ior, such as where they see the product. For example, a local Ford dealership might expect its
direct-marketing program to increase showroom traffic by 60 percent in the next 90 days, but one
objective also might be to test the effectiveness of a booth at a local shopping center.

All of the variables that are intended to satisfy the needs of the consumer are considered part
of the offer. These variables include the price, the cost of shipping and handling, optional features,
future obligations, availability of credit, extra incentives, time and quality limits, and guarantees
or warranties. The offer is supported by a message strategy, a media strategy, and the database.

Because DMC messages can be individually targeted, the more personalized the message the
better. For example, when a customer orders a book from Amazon.com, the company’s system
immediately suggests similar books. When one of the airlines sends out promotional offers to its
frequent flyers, these messages often show the number of miles traveled in the past year and the
number of rewards earned year to date. This is obviously a personalized message and definitely
attracts more attention.
ADMC message should reflect whether the offer is a one-step offer or two-step offer. Be-
cause a one-step offerasks for a direct sale response, it must include a mechanism for respond-
ing to the offer. Atwo-step offeris designed to gather leads, answer consumer questions, set up
appointments, and drive customers to a website or retail store.
Finally the message needs to counter consumers’ reluctance to buy. Buying something
through direct marketing has elements of risk because there is no salesperson or store to rely on
for assistance and information. Most direct-response messages will include copy intended to put
the buyer’s mind at rest. Guarantees and warranties are important, but another strategy was used
in a GEICO flyer to newspaper subscribers, and also in similar looking ads in the business press,
to reassure buyers about the company’s reliability.
The Response/Order Generating a response is the third step in the direct marketing process (see
Figure 16.2). To maximize the response/order rate, the DMC message must make it as easy as
possible for customers to respond. One way to do this is to offer a variety of ways in which to

respond—online, mail, phone, and fax. Also, if phone is one channel, then the more hours the
phone lines are open, the better. When customers respond online, it is important that the company
immediately acknowledge the response, thanking the customer for the order and advising when
the product will arrive. The types of customer service offered, such as toll-free telephone num-
bers for product support, free limited-time trials, and acceptance of several different credit cards,
are important techniques for overcoming customer resistance to responding. To create urgency,
the direct marketing message may also include a promotional device such as a gift or limited-
time-only price deal.
Fulfillment and Customer Follow-Up The next step in the direct marketing process is called
fulfillment,which is responding to customers’responses by getting the product to those who or-
der it. Fulfillment includes all of the back-end activities of processing the transaction, including
delivering the product, receiving payment, and providing customers with tracking numbers so
they can trace the delivery of their orders. The most critical aspect of successful direct marketing,
however, is maintaining a customer relationship.
Relationship Building Direct marketers use a database to track customer interactions and trans-
actions, the final step in Figure 16.2. Measuring and evaluating consumer behavior helps the

CHAPTER 16 • DIRECT RESPONSE 495
there is an emphasis in DM on learning what is most effective and employing that information
in succeeding efforts. Such accurate measurements and adjustments are largely responsible for
DMC’s success.
WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY MEDIA OF DMC?
Personal sales is the original and most effective—and also most expensive—form of direct mar-
keting. Sales persons are found in stores, they knock on the doors of homes, and they also make
calls on business prospects. Personal sales are also a part of home parties, which are sponsored
by such companies as Mary Kay and Weekenders.
Avon, which was named ninth on a list of “The Ten Most Successful Brands of 2010,” is one
of the biggest direct sales companies with its millions of sales representatives and some $11 mil-
lion in revenue.1Anew Avon little sister brand is Mark, a college program for direct sales on cam-
pus. The Mark college co-eds roam dormitories and sorority houses selling Mark beauty products
and fashion accessories. In early 2010, there were more than 40,000 Mark Girls signed up in
North America. The new organization combines personal sales with an e-boutique, iPhone app,
and Facebook e-shop.2
Beyond personal sales, direct marketing employs five primary tools to achieve its objectives:
(1) direct mail, (2) catalogs, (3) telemarketing, (4) direct-response advertising, and (5) online
e-marketing. What is typical of all of these forms is that they offer an opportunity for in-depth in-
formation. Copywriter and professor, Karen Mallia, who wrote the Part III opener, observes that
“direct marketers have known for years that people considering expensive or complex products
want information, and people will be persuaded when that information is delivered in copy that
sells while it tells. Much Internet advertising is simply direct marketing in electronic form: e-mails
are just another kind of “letter,” and search-engine advertising is direct copy at its tightest.”
Direct Mail

Study.3
Adirect-mail piece is a print advertising message for a product or service that is delivered
by mail. It may be as simple as a single-page letter or as complex as a three-dimensional package
consisting of a letter, a brochure, a sample, a premium, and an order card with a return envelope.
With the advances in digital printing, it is now possible to personalize not only the address and
salutation on the letter but also other parts of the information as well as the offer. Called variable
data campaigns,these marketing messages can be highly targeted, even unique to the recipient.
Kodak’s NexPress Digital Production Color Press is specifically designed for this application.
The following guidelines can be helpful for putting together direct-mail pieces:
• Get the attention of the targeted prospect as the envelope comes from the mailbox.
• Create a need for the product, show what it looks like, and demonstrate how it is used.
• Answer questions, as a good salesperson does, and reassure the buyer.
• Provide critical information about product use.
• Inspire confidence, minimize risk, and establish that the company is reputable.
• Make the sale by explaining how to buy, how to order, where to call, and how to pay for the
purchase.
• Use an incentive to encourage a fast response.
Most direct mail is sent using a third-class bulk mail permit, which requires a minimum of
200 identical pieces. Third class is cheaper than first class, but it takes longer for delivery. Esti-
mates of nondelivery of third-class mail run as high as 8 percent. The response rate for direct mail
can vary from 0.1 to 50 percent, but it’s typically in the 2 to 3 percent range. The primary vari-
ables are the offer and target audience. Offers mailed to current customers generally have a higher
response rate than those sent to noncustomers.
496 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
Because of the high level of nonresponse, direct mail is also a fairly costly tool in terms of
CPM. It can be cost efficient, however, because it can be designed to reach a highly targeted au-
dience with an offer of interest. It also is much easier to calculate the actual payout rate—at what
point do the returns of the investment begin to exceed the costs? That’s why it is considered so
much more accountable than other forms of marketing communication. As summarized here, di-
rect mail has a number of advantages and limitations:
Advantages and Limitations of Direct Mail
Advantages Description
Tells a story The medium offers a variety of formats and provides enough
space to tell a complete sales story.
Engages attention Because direct mail has little competition when it is received, it
can engage the reader’s attention.
Personalizes the message Because of the use of databases, it is now possible to personalize
direct mail across a number of consumer characteristics, such as
name, product usage, purchase history, and income.
Builds in feedback Direct mail is particularly conducive to marketing research and
can be modified until the message design matches the needs of
the desired target audience.
Reaches the unreachable Direct mail allows the marketer to reach audiences that are
inaccessible via other media.
Limitations Description
Negative perceptions The main drawback of using direct mail is the widespread
perception that it is junk mail. According to a Harris-Equifax
Consumer Privacy Survey, about 46 percent of the public see
direct-mail offers as a nuisance, and 90 percent consider them an
invasion of privacy.
Cost Direct mail has a higher cost per thousand than mass media. A
great deal of this high cost is the cost of postage. (However, it
reaches a more qualified prospect with less waste.) Another cost
factor is the maintenance of the database.
Mailing list To deliver an acceptable response rate, the quality of the mailing
list is critical. It must be maintained and updated constantly.
Response rate Because of the changing nature of mailing lists, as well as the
difficulty of keeping relevant data in the database, the response
rate can be as low as 2 or 3 percent. Even with that low response,
however, database marketers can still make money.
Vulnerability Direct-mail delivery is vulnerable to natural disasters as well as
catastrophes such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Direct-Mail Message Design The functions of a direct-mail message are similar to the steps in
the sales process. The message must move the reader through the entire process, from generating
interest to creating conviction and inducing a sale. It’s all done with a complex package of printed
pieces. Most direct-mail pieces follow a fairly conventional format. They usually consist of an
outer envelope, a letter, a brochure, supplemental flyers or folders, and a reply card with a return
envelope. These can be one-page flyers, multipanel folders, multipage brochures, or spectacular
broadsheetsthat fold out like maps big enough to cover the top of a table.
How the direct-mail piece looks is as important as what it says. The most critical decision
made by the target is whether to read the mailing or throw it away, and that decision is based on
the attractiveness and attention-getting power of the outer envelope. Amailing for Krispy Kreme
got attention when it created a coupon mailer in the shape of a box of doughnuts. Attached to the
mailer was an offer to buy a box of a dozen and get another dozen free. Instead of the usual 2 to
3 percent response rate, Krispy Kreme got an 11 percent response. The envelope should spark cu-
riosity through a creative idea as the Billings mailer for its “Trailhead” campaign illustrates.

Historically, the letter has been the most difficult element in a direct-mail package
to develop and therefore the focus of much research. Over the years many techniques have proven
effective in getting consumers to read a direct-mail letter, flyer, or brochure. Here are some hints
for writing an effective direct-response letter:
1. Get AttentionTo grab attention or generate curiosity, use pictures and headlines that tout
the product’s benefits.
2. Be RelevantSend the right message to the right person.
3. PersonalizeUse a personalized salutation. If the individual’s name is not available, the
salutation should at least be personalized to the topic, such as “Dear Cat Lover.”
4. Use a Strong Lead-InBegin the letter with a brief yet compelling or surprising statement.
For example, “Dear Friend: I could really kick myself!”
5. The OfferMake the offer as early in the body of the letter as possible and dramatize it.
6. The LetterExplain the details of the offer and use testimonials or evidence that clearly de-
scribes benefits to the customer to create conviction.
7. Drive to WebsiteUse short pieces and drive interested prospects to the website for details.
8. The ClosingEnd by repeating the offer and stating additional incentives or guarantees and
a clear call to action.

How does “snail mail” compare to e-mail? One direct marketer, Per Annum, which sells
planners, diaries, and albums for the corporate gift market, found that its orders dropped 25 per-
cent when the company changed from direct mail to e-mail. The company had been spending
$20,000 a year on personally signed letters that offered a discount on early orders. The com-
pany realized the change was a mistake even though the e-mail messages were cheaper. It de-
pends on the offer, of course, but in this case the reduced cost wasn’t worth the decrease in
sales.4

Issues: Trees, Water, and Waste Critics of direct mail cite its environmental impact. Production
of direct mail uses an estimated 100 million trees and 28 billion gallons of water annually.5And
untold millions of dollars are spent for disposal and recycling. In Colorado alone, recycling ex-

Catalogs
Acatalogis a multipage direct-mail publication (in print) that shows a variety of merchandise.
Following the explosion of digital media, however, catalogs have also evolved into easy-to-use
online publications. Originally the market of the big retailers Sears and Montgomery Ward, the
glossy big books now are those produced by such retail giants as Lands’End, Eddie Bauer, and
L.L.Bean. The industry estimates than more than 17 billion catalogs are mailed in the United
States each year—that’s about 50 for every person.6The industry also accounts for a big share of
the paper consumed annually—more than either magazines or books.

The traditional catalogs all have a variety of brands and products but there are also brand
catalogs whose merchandise is all from the sponsoring brand. J. Crew, for example, features
J. Crew-branded clothing. Marriott invites travelers to purchase its bed, bath, and room decor
products from a catalog that is available in its rooms. The real growth in this field is in the area
of specialty catalogs. There are catalogs for every hobby and for more general interests.
The reason paper catalogs continue to be such a force in direct marketing is that they pay.
Glossy catalogs still move people to buy in ways that digital images don’t, although catalogs can
drive traffic to websites where the actual purchase is made.8
Online catalogs cross the line between e-commerce and direct marketing. Amazon.com’s
website, for example, contains complete information about the product offerings, such as book
reviews, as well as a way to place an order, pay for it, and contact customer service if there is a
problem. The website operates like a direct-mail catalog, but interactivity makes it even more use-
ful than a print version can be. Customers can make inquiries and the company can use its data-
bases to personalize customer communication.
Even though some issued warnings early on about how the Internet would kill off catalogs,

lasting impression. culled consumers who receive catalogs but don’t order from them.
Another factor in the effectiveness of catalogs is the nature of the interactions between cus-
tomers and the company, whether over the phone or the Internet. Lands’End has been a model of
customer care that leads not just to brand loyalty, but also brand love. Lands’End has been rec-
ognized for doing things like marshalling a corps of some 200 employee volunteers who respond
to customer mail. The company has even been known to replace products before the customers
discover they are faulty. Jeanne Bliss, chief customer officer at Lands’End, who helped create
this culture of customer care explains that this high-touch approach has won Lands’End a lot of
love, a point she writes about in her book, I Love You More Than My Dog.9
Some catalog retailers have their own stores, such as title nine, Williams-Sonoma and
Tiffany’s. Banana Republic, which began as a catalog marketer and then moved into retailing, is
now launching its first catalog since 1988. Many large retailers are now multichannel, using cat-
alogs, websites, and stores. Some marketers, such as L.L.Bean, have also seen their catalog mail-

ings drive business to their websites. Bean expects that its online sales will soon overtake its cat-
alog business, but it will still send out catalogs as a way to generate online sales. The advantages
and limitations of marketing communication via catalogs are listed here:
Advantages and Limitations of Catalogs
Advantages Description
Targeted Can be directed at specific market segments.
Engages attention Employs high-quality design and photography
Complete information Extensive product information and comparisons are provided.
Convenience Offer a variety of purchase options.
Limitations Description
Negative perceptions Catalogs are viewed as junk mail by many recipients.
Costs The cost per thousand catalogs is higher than that for mass media.
Response rate The response is relatively low at 3 to 4 percent.
Mailing list Databases must be constantly maintained.
Anumber of marketers are using video or CD catalogs because these provide more infor-
mation about their products. Car companies, for example, use online catalogs or CDs. The mes-
sage can be interactive and feature animated illustrations. The catalog presents graphic
descriptions and detailed text on the current models, including complete specifications. With
some, you can even custom design your dream car.
Telemarketing
Before telemarketing calls were greatly limited by government-supported do-not-call lists, more
direct marketing dollars were spent on telemarketing phone calls than on any other DMC

medium. That’s because telemarketing is a form of personal sales, but a lot less expensive. An in-
person sales call may cost anywhere from $50 to $1,000 after factoring in time and transporta-
tion. In comparison, a telephone call ranges from $2 to $15 per call. That is still expensive if you
compare it to the CPM of an advertisement placed in any one of the mass media ($10 to $50 per
thousand); however, the returns are much higher than those generated by mass advertising be-
cause they are intrusive, personalized, and interactive. The caller also can respond to buyers’ob-
jections and make a persuasive sales argument.

There are two types of telemarketing: inbound and outbound. An inbound telemarketingor
incoming telemarketing call is initiated by a customer. The consumer can be responding to an ad,
catalog, e-mail, or fax. L.L.Bean’s telephone representatives are trained to handle inbound calls
in such a helpful manner that the company often features their friendly approach in its catalogs.
Calls originating from the firm are outgoing or outbound telemarketing.These calls typically
generate the most consumer resistance because they are uninvited, intrusive, and unexpected.
Telemarketing Message Design The key point to remember about telemarketing messages is
that they need to be simple enough to be delivered over the telephone. If the product requires a
visual demonstration or a complicated explanation, then the message might be better delivered by
direct mail. The message also must be compelling. People resent intrusive telephone calls, so
there must be a strong initial benefit or reason-why statement to convince prospects to continue
listening. The message also must be short; most people won’t stay on the telephone longer than
two to three minutes for a sales call.
Issues: Intrusion, Fraud, and Privacy Telemarketing has its drawbacks. Perhaps the most uni-
versally despised telemarketing tool is predictive dialing.Predictive dialing technology makes

it possible for telemarketing companies to call
anyone—even those with unlisted numbers.
Special computerized dialing programs use ran-
dom dialing. This explains why, from time to
time, when you answer your phone you simply
hear an empty line; the predictive dialer has
called your number before a call agent is free.
Many people consider these calls a nuisance,
and they can even be alarming, because burglars
have been known to call a house to see if any-

The most serious restriction on telemarketing—a program that consumers love—is imple-
mented by state and national “do-not-call” lists. The national Do Not Call Registry had 31.6 mil-
lion sign-ups even before it took effect in 2003 and had grown to more than 149 million by 2007.
Telemarketing companies responded by challenging the legality of these lists in court based on
what they believe to be an illegal restriction on commercial free speech. In late 2004, however,
the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling that the industry’s free speech rights were
not violated by the do-not-call list.
The do-not-call lists do not restrict companies from calling their own customers, and they
allow nonprofits to continue calling and market research firms to continue conducting phone sur-
veys. Telemarketers subscribe to the database and check the list at least monthly for numbers they
need to delete. The subscription cost is $62 for each area code with a $17,000 maximum for a na-
tional list. The no-call list registration expires after five years, so consumers are finding that they
may have to reregister.10
Some phone companies offer their customers a service called “Privacy Manager” that
screens out sales calls. For customers who have Caller ID, numbers that register as “unavailable”
or “unknown” are intercepted by a recorded message that asks callers to identify themselves. If
the caller does so, the call rings through.
Direct-Response Advertising
The common thread that runs through all types of direct-response advertising is that of action.
The move to action is what makes direct-response advertising effective. Syracuse University
Professor John Philip Jones points to direct advertising as being more effective than general ad-
vertising and says advertisers have a lot to learn from direct marketers.11
Print Media Ads in the mass media are less directly targeted than are direct mail and catalog,
but they can still provide the opportunity for a direct response. Ads in newspapers and magazines
can carry a coupon, an order form, an address, or a toll-free or 900 telephone number. The re-
sponse may be either to purchase something or to ask for more information. In many cases the
desired response is an inquiry that becomes a sales lead for field representatives.
502 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
Aclassic example of the power of direct-response
advertising is the “97-Pound Weakling” ads for the
Charles Atlas body building mail-order courses that fea-
tured a cartoon telling the story of a scrawny guy who
decides to bulk up after a well-built lifeguard kicks sand
in his face and steals his girlfriend. The business was
launched in 1928 when Atlas partnered with adman
Charles Roman to promote the Charles Atlas exercise
system and correspondence course. The campaign cre-
ated a multimillion-dollar business and the “97-pound
weakling” who turned into a “he man” became a pop
culture icon.
Catalogs also have been effective direct-response
marketers for as long as there has been mail. The famous
Sears catalogs began in 1888 with a line of watches and
jewelry. In 1894 the offerings were expanded to include
sewing machines, bicycles, saddles, musical instru-
ments and a host of new items. In 1896 the slogan
“Cheapest Supply House on Earth” was added to the
cover. For more on the history of this iconic direct-re-
sponse vehicle, visit http://www.searsarchives.com/.
Broadcast Media Adirect-response commercial on ra-
dio or TVcan provide the necessary information (usu-
ally a simple, easy-to-remember toll-free phone number
or Web address) for the consumer to request information
or even make a purchase. Radio’s big advantage is its
highly targeted audience. In contrast, television is a
good medium for direct marketers who are advertising a
broadly targeted product.

Direct-response TV also makes good use of the
infomercial format. Infomercials blur the lines be-
tween retail and direct response. Infomercials have
been around since the emergence of the cable industry and have become a multibillion-dollar
industry. An infomercial is typically 30 or 60 minutes long and tends to be played during non-
prime-time periods. The Salton-Maxim Juiceman infomercial took the company from $18 mil-
lion to $52 million in sales overnight and made a marketing superstar of George Foreman. The
Salton commercial made Juiceman the brand to buy, whether direct from television or from a
local department store or mass merchant.
Today, the infomercial is viewed as a viable medium because (1) consumers now have con-
fidence in infomercials and the products they sell; (2) with the involvement of upscale advertis-
ers, the quality of infomercial production and supportive research has improved; (3) consumers
can be better segmented and infomercials are coordinated with respect to these audiences; and
(4) infomercials can easily be introduced into foreign markets. Marketers are more likely to use
the infomercial format if their product needs to be demonstrated, is not readily available through
retail outlets, and has a relatively high profit margin.
Telebrands, a direct-response TV (DRTV) marketer, for many years used pitchman Billy
Mays until he died in 2009. Using a reality show format, the company offered tryouts for the
Mays replacement. Even AdAgecolumnist Larry Dobrow tried out for the position. Mays was
the undisputed king of TVpitching and sold as much as 70 percent of the gadgets offered on air.
CHAPTER 16 • DIRECT RESPONSE 503
A leading direct-response auto insurer, GEICO uses its Gecko character as a spokes-creature to sell its products on
television, as well as in print.
The Telebrands president admitted that “you can double the response with the right pitch person
vs. no pitch person.”12
Cable television lends itself to direct response because the medium is more tightly targeted
to particular interests. QVC and the Home Shopping Network reach more than 70 million house-
holds and service their calls with huge phone banks.

The technology of the Internet also has produced dramatic changes in the direct-mail indus-
try. At a most basic level, the Internet has facilitated the ease in producing and distributing tradi-
tional direct mail by e-mail. E-mail marketing software and advertising assistance is available
from such companies as Constant Contact (www.constantcontact.com), which even provides e-
mail templates. Services such as Constant Contact and MailNow offers a streamlined process that
allows users to point-and-click their way through a series of predesigned e-mailer templates
priced and sorted by industry, as well as select mailing lists and various mail media (postcards,
letters, flyers, or newsletters). Customers can customize the mailer with their logo and other pro-
prietary images or copy.
Another feature of Internet direct marketing is greater sampling opportunities. Online
music stores now have hundreds of thousands of music clips for shoppers to listen to before
making a purchase. Eddie Bauer lets site visitors “try on” clothes in a virtual dressing room.
It also sends them e-mail messages offering special prices on items based on their past pur-
chasing patterns.
Today, the use of extensive database information and innovative e-mail technology, com-
bined with creative marketing strategies, has brought the benefits of highly personalized, inex-
pensive messages to far-reaching mass campaigns. E-mail marketing is developing and becoming
more strategic as new technologies are developed. Three basic types of e-mail campaigns are used
in marketing communication:
• Addressable to current customers
• Addressable to prospects
• Unsolicited and often unwanted, or spam.
An option in the “addressable” category is one that is still evolving and that is the idea of sending
automated direct marketing messages via GPS-enabled mobile devices, such as iPhones. Various
504 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
innovations are being tested to make these geomarketing tech-
niques useful without becoming a privacy issue.13
Well-known corporate brands such as BMWare using e-
mail as a DMC tool. In one campaign, the company invited ex-
isting and prospective customers to view a collection of Web
movies about new BMW models. Another campaign notified
BMWowners of a new section at BMW.comreserved strictly for
their use. Called the “Owner’s Circle,” the section allows own-
ers to obtain special services and set up profiles that track main-
tenance items specific to their cars. Shortly after the mailing,
enrollment in the Owner’s Circle doubled, and participation in
BMW’s financial services program tripled.
Issue: Spam Although e-mail marketing has enjoyed in-
creased success, the practice has received intense criticism for
generating too much unwanted e-mail, otherwise known as
spam.The FTC has determined that 90 percent of all spam in-
volving business and investment opportunities contains false or
misleading information. The problem also exists with nearly
half of the messages promoting health products and travel and
leisure. This is why Congress passed the CAN-SPAM Act in
2003. The problem is so big that some industry experts estimate
that more than half of all e-mail messages are spam.

Is spam cost effective? Spammers solicit business from sources like AOL’s profiles where
people indicate their interests and activities. Aspammer might send out 100,000 e-mails and get
only two to five clients, which seems like a totally unacceptable number of responses. But a spam-
mer who charges $300 to send out 100,000 messages or $900 for a million might make $14,000
to $15,000 on those few responses. That’s not a bad return when you consider the cost of getting
into the business—a computer and an Internet connection.
Here are some of the ways consumers can reduce the amount of unwanted direct mail or
spam they receive:15
• If you enter a contest or order an item by mail, you may wind up on a mailing list. To protect
your contact information, check the “opt-out” box and write “No mailing lists” beside your
contact information.
• Use the “Contact Us” link on retailers’websites to ask to be taken off mailing lists.
• Check the “Privacy” link at the bottom of a company’s home page for directions on remov-
ing your name from its mailing lists.
• The Mail Preference Service of DMApermits you to register for $5 to get off mailing lists
(www.dmaconsumers.org/cgi/offmailing).
CHAPTER 16 • DIRECT RESPONSE 505
• To get off credit card solicitation lists, call 888-5-OPT-OUT. Arecorded message will ask for
your contact information, but that’s just confirmation. This service already has your contact
information; providing it by phone confirms your identity so your request can be processed.
• To register for the federal do-not-call list, go to donotcall.govand sign up. That will cut
down on unwanted phone calls from marketers.
• To reduce the amount of spam you receive, register at e-MPS, which is DMA’s e-mail Pref-
erence Service (http://dmaconsumers.org/consumers/optoutform_emps.shtml).
You might note that in most cases, if you have a relationship with a company—which means
you’ve ordered something within the past 12 months—you won’t be deleted from those lists.
Blanket requests to end unsolicited calls or mail may not apply to charities and politicians be-
cause of First Amendment issues. Nonprofit organizations do a lot of solicitations by mail.
Permission Marketing Because spam is a huge problem for legitimate e-mail marketers, they Principle
are now using an approach called permission marketing.This approach attempts to address the Opt-in and opt-out
spam problem by asking potential consumers for their permission to send them e-mail. Solutions strategies make e-mail

WHY ARE DATABASES THE FOUNDATION OF DMC?
Looking back, you’ll note that Figures 16.1and 16.2both begin with databases. Why is that so? Di-
rect marketers use databasesto keep track of current customers and identify prospective customers.
They are also a segmentation tool to communicate relevant offers to customers and prospects. An-
other benefit for companies that keep track of their customers’online behavior is that they are bet-
ter able to personalize their DMC messages. Adatabase is at the heart of direct marketing.
For example, consider how Carnival Cruise Lines uses databases to manage its customer re-
lationships. Information is gathered at check-in when customers get their Sail & Sign card, which
serves as money on the cruise (it also allows Carnival to track its customers’purchases and activ-
ities). New customers receive a standard card but returning passengers get a gold card that triggers
“Welcome back” messages from staff. Frequent cruisers get a platinum card and automatic mem-
bership in the Concierge Club with perks such as priority embarking and debarking, dining times,
and spa reservations. These data are then used to target follow-up e-mail and direct-mail offers.
The authors of a set of books that focus on one-to-one marketing defined it as a strategy that
delivers customer-focused objectives by treating different customers differently. Through the use
of databases, they describe the learning relationshipthat results from customer dialogue. Here is
how this data-driven relationship works:16
If you’re my customer and I get you to talk to me, I remember what you tell me, and I get
smarter and smarter about you. I know something about you competitors don’t know. So I
can do things for you my competitors can’t do, because they don’t know you as well as I
do. Before long, you can get something from me you can’t get anywhere else, for any price.
At the very least you’d have to start all over somewhere else, but starting over is more costly
than staying with us.

information. DMC is possible because of innovations in computer technology that have helped compa-
nies keep up with their customers. People move, have children, marry, divorce, remarry, change
jobs, age, and retire and change their purchase behavior through all of these changes. The pur-
pose of the database is to produce up-to-date information on customers and prospects as well as
their interactions with the company. According to the DMA, a good marketing database has these
primary objectives:17
• Record names of customers, expires (names no longer valid), and prospects.
• Store and analyze responses.
• Store and analyze purchasing performance.
• Continue direct communication with customers.

Marketers own their own lists or rent lists based on customer characteristics, such as geog-
raphy, age, gender, and personal interests (sailboat owners, college students). There are three
types of lists:
• Ahouse listis made up of the marketer’s own customers or members in its most important tar-
get market. It is its most valuable list. These lists are compiled when stores offer credit plans,
service plans, special sale announcements, and contests that require customers to sign up.
Some stores, such as Radio Shack, fill in customers’names and addresses at the cash register.
• Aresponse listis made up of people or households who have responded to some type of
direct-response offer. The more similar the product to which they responded is to the
marketer’s product, the more valuable the list because these people should be similar to the
company’s current customers. For example, if you sell pet food, you might like a list of peo-
ple who have responded to a magazine ad for a pet identification collar. Two important crite-
ria are obvious from such a list: these people very likely have a pet, and they are open to
buying from a catalog, mail offer, or website.
• Acompiled listis a list of some specific category, such as sports car owners, new home
buyers, graduating seniors, new mothers, association members, or subscribers to a magazine,
book club, or record club. Luxury car manufacturers are always interested in lists of people
who belong to country clubs, own a yacht, or own luxury cars, because these people obvi-
ously like and can afford such luxuries.
New lists can be created by merging and purging. If you want to target older women in New
England who play tennis, for example, most list houses would be able to put together a database
for you by combining lists, called merging,and then deleting the repeated names, called purging.
This is a postcard mailed to B2B direct marketers offering lists classified into
47 different types of buying characteristics. It separates prospects in terms of

For example, you may want to develop a list of people who are in the market for fine furniture in
your city. You could buy a list of new home buyers and combine that with a list of people who live
in a desirable census tract. These two lists together—a compiled list—would let you find people
who have bought new homes in upscale neighborhoods.

Services such as Prodigy and Melissa DATA(see the website download) provide users with
online buying services, remember purchases, and, over time, can build a purchase profile of each

concern to consumer activists and consumers who worryabout privacy.
Nintendo uses the 2 million names in its database when it introduces more powerful versions
of its video game system. The names and addresses are gathered from a list of subscribers to its
magazine,Nintendo Power.The company believes that many of its current customers will want
to trade up systems, and this direct communication makes it possible for Nintendo to speak di-
rectly to its most important target market about new systems as they become available. Nintendo
began its database in 1988 and credits database marketing with helping it maintain its huge share
of the $6 billion to $7 billion video game market.
Data Mining The practice of sifting through and sorting information captured in a company’s
database to target customers and maintain a relationship with them is called data mining.18Such
information includes comprehensive profiles based on demographics, lifestyle, and behavior, as
well as basic contact information.

CHAPTER 16 • DIRECT RESPONSE 509
How is data mining used? Marketers collect information about their cus-
tomers to better target customers who might really be interested in their offers.
This is called behavioral targeting,to which we referred in Chapter 5. Instead of
sending mass e-mails (spam) to everyone on a list, marketers can send informa-
tion to people who are really interested in their product or service based on their
past purchases and other product-related actions.
Data mining is also used to spot trends and patterns—frequent flyers may
also be buyers of international phone cards, for example. Using the practice dis-
cussed earlier called prospecting,data mining also can be used to profile prospects
based on key characteristics of current customers. If a grocery store that uses a
loyalty card to track its customers’purchases notices that the young families in
its customer pool live in certain neighborhoods, then it can target family-oriented
promotions to those particular neighborhoods rather than spraying them across its
entire geographical market.

ternational borders is also important. with a customer or
prospect.
Integrated Direct Marketing
Historically, direct marketing is the first area of marketing communication that adopted an inte-
grated marketing approach. In fact, some people refer to DMC as integrated direct marketing
(IDM).As technology has provided more and better ways to interact with customers, the chal-
lenge to direct marketers has been to integrate direct mail, catalogs, telemarketing, websites,
e-mail, text messaging, and instant messaging with other marketing communication, such as ad-
vertising—and to do so with a consistent brand voice that reflects the brand strategy.
Two reasons integration plays so well in the direct-response market is because of its em-
phasis on the customer and its measurability. The coordination problem is a challenge due to the
deluge of data bombarding customers from many different channels. The only way to manage the
information is to focus it around customer needs and interests. By using databases, companies can
become more sensitive to customer wants and needs and less likely to bother them with unwanted
commercial messages.
Linking the Channels Instead of treating each medium separately, as some advertising agencies
tend to do, DMC companies seek to achieve precise, synchronized use of the right media at the
right time, with a measurable return on dollars spent. Here’s an example: Say you do a direct-mail

campaign, which generates a 2 percent average response. If you include a toll-free 800 number
in your mailing as an alternative to the standard mail-in reply—with well-trained, knowledgeable
people handling those incoming calls with a carefully thought-out script—you can achieve a 3 to
4 percent response rate. If you follow up your mailing with a phone call within 24 to 72 hours af-
ter your prospect receives the mailing, you can generate a response two to eight times as high as
the base rate of 2 percent. So, by adding your 800 number, you bring the response rate from 2 per-
cent to 3 or 4 percent. By following up with phone calls, you bring your total response rate as high
as 5 to 18 percent.
The principle behind integration is that not all people respond the same way to direct-
response messages. One person may carefully fill out the order form. Someone else may imme-
diately call the 800 number. Most people, if a DMC message grabs them, tend to put it in the
pending pile. That pile grows and grows, and then goes into the garbage at the end of the month.
But, if a phone call or e-mail follows the direct-mail piece, the marketer may get the wavering
consumer off the fence. Hewlett-Packard, AT&T, Citibank, and IBM have all used integrated di-
rect marketing as a multimedia effort to improve their direct marketing response rates.
Safeway Stores has become interested in integrated direct marketing. Essentially, Safeway
has signed up manufacturers such as the Quaker Oats Company and Stouffer Food Corp. (owned
by Nestlé) for a database marketing program that provides trade dollars in exchange for quality
customer data. The program exemplifies the convergence of two trends: grocers looking for man-
ufacturers to supplement their own shrunken marketing budgets and manufacturers eager to allo-
cate new field marketing support dollars are working more closely as partners. A number of
manufacturers whose products are carried in Safeway stores fund Safeway’s quarterly mailings
in exchange for in-store support and sales data.
Acommon problem with IDM is that direct marketing messages and advertising messages
often do not reinforce each other as well as they should because the two functions—advertising
and direct marketing, which often are handled by different agencies—don’t talk to one another.
This will change, however, as clients demand more coordination of their marketing communica-
tion programs. The point is that direct marketing can add impact to an IMC campaign and increase
its efficiency.
Creating Loyalty One of the best practices noted by Duncan in the Part 5 opener is the devel- Principle
opment of solid customer-brand relationships. When effective, one-on-one communication leads One-on-one
to a customer retention strategy that ultimately increases brand loyalty. Direct response is a highly communication leads to a

lifetime customer value (LCV).LCVis an estimate of how much purchase volume companies
can expect to get over time from various target markets. To put it formally, LCVis the financial
contribution through sales volume of an individual customer or customer segment over a length
of time. The calculation is based on known consumption habits plus future consumption expec-
tations. The estimate of the contribution is defined as return on investment, or revenue gains as a
function of marketing costs. In simpler terms, by knowing your consumers’past behavior, you
can decide how much you want to spend to get them to purchase and then repurchase your prod-
uct, and you can track your investment by measuring the response.
Consumer resistance to direct marketing must be considered in efforts to build loyalty.
Changing consumers’attitudes about direct marketing has not been easy because consumers
resent companies that know too much about them. If the company can demonstrate that it is act-
ing in the consumer’s best interest rather than just trolling for dollars, it might gain and maintain
consumers’loyalty. Saks Fifth Avenue, for example, identified the customers who account for half
of all sales and offered the group exclusive benefits through a program called Saks First. The ben-
efits include fashion newsletters and a first crack at all sales.
The most important goal, however, is supporting brand building, and some marketers have
been concerned that DMC’s emphasis on accountability and emphasis on driving sales has made
it less focused on the brand presence. One back-end operation, GSI Interactive, which had been
known for its handling of online sales, created a spin-off called True Action that is tasked with
512 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
the mission of building brands. The point is that, as a True Action executive observed, if the
agency doesn’t understand the base business, “they can make dumb decisions.”21
Global Considerations in DMC
The direct marketing industry is growing fast in many Far Eastern and European countries—in
some places, even faster than in the United States. The global trend is fueled by the same tech-
nological forces driving the growth of direct marketing in this country: the increasing use of com-
puter databases, credit cards, toll-free phone numbers, and the Internet, along with the search for
more convenient ways to shop. The growth may be even greater in business-to-business market-
ing than in consumer marketing.
Direct marketing is particularly important in countries that have tight restrictions on adver-
tising and other forms of marketing communication. However, these countries often have re-
strictions on direct marketing as well. Privacy issues are even more intense in some countries than
in the United States. In some countries, lists are not available, or they may be of poor quality.
Databases can be more freely transferred between European countries than they can between the
United States and European countries.
Some countries have instituted outright bans on direct marketing, although these restrictions
seem to be loosening up. China lifted its national ban on direct sales, such as Amway and Avon,
in late 2005. The ban had been in place since 1998 because of a series of scandals and frauds.22
Governmental regulation of the postal service may also place limitations on the use of direct
mail. For example, language and characters are a problem, particularly for American companies
that may not understand that the letter eisn’t the same as é,è,ê,orëin an address. Computers
and typesetting systems have to accommodate these differences. The format of the address has to
be exactly correct in some countries, such as Germany, where the Deutsche Post has strict rules
about correct address formats. In Hungary the street name is in the third line of the address,
whereas it is on the second line along with the postal code in Germany. Presorted mail in a wrong
format may result in charges to the end user that significantly raise the cost of the mailing.
What Are the Advantages and Limitations of DMC
In addition to interactivity, which is its greatest gift to marketing communicators, another big ad-
vantage of direct marketing over indirect marketing, such as advertising, can be summarized in
one word: accountability. DMAdescribes this strength as the ability to track, measure, and opti-
mize marketing communication.23Other advantages include the following:
• Direct marketing messages can be personalized, which makes them much more persuasive
than nonpersonalized (mass-media) messages.
• Direct marketing results are measurable so the ROI is easily known.
• Direct marketing technology allows for the collection of relevant information about the cus-
tomer, contributing to the development of a useful database and selective reach, which re-
duces waste.
• Products have added value, through the convenient purchase process and reliable/quick de-
livery mechanisms of direct marketing. Purchase is not restricted to a location.
• The marketer controls the product (rather than the wholesaler or retailer) until delivery.
• Advertising carrying direct marketing components is more effective than advertising not us-
ing direct marketing.
• Direct marketing affords flexibility both in form and timing.
Like all tools, direct marketing has some weaknesses. Most notably, consumers are still re-
luctant to purchase a product they cannot touch and feel. Another weakness is the annoyance as-
sociated with direct marketing, such as too many catalogs, junk mail, online pop-ups, ad clutter,
spam e-mail, and unwelcome phone calls. There are serious problems with customer privacy and
data sharing as well as concerns about identity theft. Finally, in the tension between creating a
long-term brand image and driving immediate sales, direct marketing tends to be more attuned to
the latter. But that doesn’t mean brand building is impossible with direct marketing. In particular,
direct marketers, such as L.L.Bean, Amazon.com, Nature Conservancy, and Dell Computer, have
built strong brands primarily through direct marketing.
CHAPTER 16 • DIRECT RESPONSE 513
Looking Ahead
Direct-response marketing communication is an important tool in the IMC toolkits because it is
uniquely designed to deliver interactivity. As we have said, dialogue-based communication is the
foundation for brand relationships. DMC is also important because of its ability to track effec-
tiveness. Now in the next chapter let’s consider the various ways people are engaged in brand ex-
periences through promotions.
IT’S A WRAP
The Gecko and Friends
Drive Customer Response
In this chapter we identified many benefits of using direct-response marketing. It can reach a large, diverse
audience efficiently to generate customers for auto insurance. GEICO’s aggressive effort to blanket the na-
tion with an array of campaigns, including The Gecko, the Cavemen, the customer/celebrity testimonials, and
“Rhetorical Questions,” teaches an important brand communication lesson about direct marketing. It demon-
strates how effective direct-response advertising and a little bit of humor can sell a product to a wide-ranging
and varied audience, even in a tough economy.
One report estimated 2007 auto-industry advertising expenditures at $1.7 billion, with GEICO, Allstate,
Progressive Corp., and State Farm accounting for about 73 percent of the total. GEICO reportedly spent
$561 million on advertising in 2008. In lieu of a sales force, direct advertising does the job.
The Gecko and Caveman have earned their way into the hearts of consumers, winning many awards in-
cluding the Direct Marketing Association’s Echo award. The Caveman joined The Gecko as a favorite brand
icon, having been elected to the Madison Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame. According to the GEICO web-
site, “The Caveman, still perturbed with GEICO for its ‘So easy, a caveman could do it’ slogan, did not attend
the award ceremony.”

Frontier Campaigns for Favorite
Animal Votes and Web Hits
How do you follow up a successful campaign like Frontier Airline’s “Flip to
Mexico” campaign? (See Chapter 8’s opening story.) Frontier handed
Shawn Couzens and Gary Ennis, creative directors from Grey Worldwide in
New York City, their next challenge: Drive consumers to the website. Airlines pre-
fer passengers to book on the Web rather than via phone with agents because the
company saves money, and capturing e-mails builds the airline’s database.
Sometimes to reach the marketing and campaign objectives, advertisers need
to be willing to take risks to be rewarded. How far could Couzens and Ennis push
Frontier?
Couzens explained, “We would never do something ‘out there’ just to do it. It
has to line up with the strategy and reflect who we are. A brand is a lot like a per-
son. It has a distinct personality, a unique identity, and a belief system. And just like
a person, if we misrepresent the brand, then people won’t trust it. So, whenever
we embark on an assignment, we ask, ‘Is this consistent with our brand personal-
ity? Does this deliver on our brand promise?’ And if the idea doesn’t fit who Fron-
tier is or what people expect from us, then we dump it.”
The Grey team created an online contest that let citizens vote for their favorite
animal. Seven of the animals campaigned via the Frontier website in a satire of real
political campaigns. Would people pick Grizwald the Bear, Flip the Dolphin, Hec-
tor the Otter, Jack (who else?) the Rabbit, Larry the Lynx, the Penguins, or Sal the
Cougar?
Couzens described how the contest fit the brand: “Fortunately, our brand per-
sonality is easygoing, friendly, and fun. We’re ‘a whole different animal,’ so we can
do things that demonstrate how different and unique we are—and that comes
through not just in the ads but in the brand experience as a whole.”
Fans could go to Frontier’s home page to get to the contest, then click on a
squeaky door to enter the virtual Campaign Headquarters. Once there, visitors
could interact with various aspects of the campaign: They could listen to a debate
between trash-talking contestants, order posters of their favorite animal, watch

commercials on a TV set, order real press kits with T-shirts, listen to each contes-
tant’s platform, join a YouTube group, or participate in an online forum.
Here’s a sample of the animals’ political platforms: Griz the Bear wants to give
voters free all-you-can-eat buffets, back massages, and free flights for every man,
woman, and child, none of which, unsurprisingly, are endorsed by Frontier. Jack
runs on an environmental platform. He promises lower health care costs, a
statewide cap on fuel costs, and reductions in greenhouse emissions. Hector ap-
parently chooses to run on his good looks: He is cute and cuddly and can make
squishy sounds with his cheeks. The commercials even let the candidates engage
in a bit of political backbiting.
Built-in fun on the site captured visitors’ attention with a clock that actually told

Frontier’s “Denver’s Favorite Animal” campaign is an example of an award-winning promotion
that captivated viewers and involved them personally in building loyalty to the airline. Sales pro-
motion is about the fun, creative, and exciting ideas that the promotion industry uses to spur ac-
tion and build strong brand relationships. In this chapter, we will explain the difference between
consumer and trade promotions, as well as other programs, such as loyalty programs, tie-ins, and
sponsorships, that cross the line between advertising, PR, and promotion. First let’s discuss the
concept and basic principles of sales promotion.
WHY SALES PROMOTION?
When a marketer increases the value of its product or brand by offering an extra incentive to pur-
chase it, the marketer is creating a sales promotion,which is the subject of this chapter. In most
cases the objective of sales promotion is to encourage action. Promotions in a more general sense
can also help build brand identity and awareness, as the Frontier Airlines case illustrates, but their
primary contribution to most marketing communication programs is to drive behavior.
The Promotion Marketing Association (PMA) is the professional organization serving this
$2 trillion industry. Founded in 1911, the organization promotes excellence in promotion mar-
keting and showcases such practices in its Reggie Awards program. Although the breadth of the
industry has exploded with the new opportunities provided by the Internet, a simple definition
identifies the key elements of promotion marketing as follows: “The media and non-media mar-
keting pressure applied for a predetermined, limited period of time at the level of consumer, re-
tailer, or wholesaler in order to stimulate trial, increase consumer demand, or improve product
availability.”1

CHAPTER 17 • PROMOTIONS 519
Why Is Sales Promotion Growing?
Over the years, advertising and sales promotion have been battling for their share of the market-
ing communication budget, but sales promotion, including both consumer and trade promotions,
now accounts for more than half of the budget. Until the 1980s, advertising was the dominant
player in the marketing communication arena. But during the 1980s more marketers found them-
selves driving immediate bottom-line responses through the use of sales promotion.
Accountability In terms of the need for accountability for marketing communication efforts,
most U.S. companies focus on immediate profits, a drive that sales promotion satisfies. Because
the benefits of advertising are often more apparent in the long term, companies invest more
money in sales promotion when they want quick results. Product managers are under pressure to
generate quarterly, or even monthly or weekly, sales increases. Arlene Gerwin, a marketing con-
sultant who consults on promotional planning, explains, “Sales promotions deliver more imme-
diate consumer response and a quicker payback than advertising.”2 Hence the pressure for
short-term profits leads to bigger sales promotion budgets.
Another aspect of accountability is result driven. Sales promotions are relatively easy to
evaluate in terms of their impact on sales and whether a sales promotion strategy has accom-
plished its objectives. Because promotions operate in a finite time frame and deliver action, in
Gerwin’s view, it is relatively easy and quick to evaluate their success because there is usually an
immediate response of some kind.
It also is easier to compute a return on investment (ROI) for promotions than for advertising.
This process is known as payout planningand means that the results derived from a promotion
can be estimated and compared with the projected costs of the effort. If the promotion doesn’t de-
liver more than it costs, then it is not a good idea, at least financially. Admittedly there may be other
reasons for conducting a promotion, but usually the go/no-go decision is based on the effort’s ROI.
For example, Moonfruit, a company that helps small businesses build do-it-yourself web-
sites, gave away 10 MacBook Pros as part of a birthday celebration. To be eligible, participants
had to send a creative Tweet, an idea that exploded on Twitter, brought lots of people to the com-
pany’s website, and generated tons of publicity. If handled through a traditional advertising cam-
paign, the exposure would have cost far more than the price of 10 MacBook Pros.3(Check out
Moonfruit at www.moonfruit.com.)
Media Shifts Advertisers also cite other economic reasons for the shift. Traditional media costs
have escalated to the point where alternative types of media must be considered. As the networks
have raised their advertising prices, their share of prime-time television viewers has dropped dra-
matically. The proliferation of media and competition for audiences’attention also factor in the
need for accountability. Advertisers, therefore, are exploring marketing communication forms
that cost less and produce immediate, tangible results. Sales promotion can deliver these results.
Global incentive programs are also experiencing explosive growth and much of that relates
either to IMC or changes in global media. The international product manager for one promotional
company indicates that the number of clients seeking global incentive programs has increased
dramatically. Some of the reasons for this growth include the interest of multinational corpora-
tions in aligning all units with corporate goals, increasing bottom-line efficiency, and taking ad-
vantage of the rise of the Internet.4
Marketplace Changes Other reasons for the move to sales promotion match changes in the mar-
ketplace, such as these:
• Consumer BehaviorShoppers today are better educated, more selective, and less loyal to
brand names than in the past, which means they are more likely to switch brands.
• PricingConsumers have come to expect constant short-term price reductions such as
coupons, sales, and price promotions.
• Market ShareIn most industries, the battle is for market share rather than general product
growth. Sales promotion encourages people to switch products, increasing market share.
• Parity ProductsSales promotion is often the most effective strategy for increasing sales of a
parity product when the products in the category are largely undifferentiated. When products
are similar, promotions become the tie-breaker in the consumer’s decision making.
520 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
• The Power of the RetailerDominant retailers, such as Safeway, Walmart, Toys “R” Us, and
Home Depot, demand a variety of promotional incentives before allowing products into their
stores.
From the consumers’perspective, sales promotion reduces the risk associated with a pur-
Principle
chase by giving them something of added value such as a coupon, rebate, or discounted price.
Sales promotion reduces
the risk of trying a new Promotions typically offer the consumer added value, or “more for less,” as a Southwest Airlines
product by giving promotion illustrates. Developed in conjunction with Alamo, the promotion promised those who
something of added value fly Southwest and rent vehicles from Alamo that they could earn double Rapid Rewards credit to-
to motivate action. ward a free flight—for a limited time, of course.
Sales Promotion Planning
Similar to advertising and other marcom areas, promotions are developed with a plan, sometimes
called a creative brief. This summarizes the usual planning decisions, such as SWOTs, brand po-
sitioning strategy, promotional objectives, targeting and consumer insights, budget, scheduling,
and timing.
An example comes from the launch of Via, Starbucks’instant coffee. To demonstrate that
the instant product tastes like its regular brew, the company promoted a “taste challenge” that took
place at Starbucks stores on the launch weekend. Customers were able to sample a cup of brewed
coffee and a cup of Via to see if they could tell the difference. The event was promoted with tel-
evision commercials and on social marketing sites.

For example, Frontier’s long-running position as a different kind of animal is reflected in a
short-termpromotionalcampaigntochooseafavoriteanimalfromthespokes-animalsonthe
planes’tails.
The challenge is to come up with exciting, interesting promotional ideas that are involving
and capture the attention of the target market—and that includes consumers, as well as trade part-
ners in the industry. One of the wackiest promotional ideas recently used was for the KitKat candy
bar. It involves the use of religion, which is certainly novel but also raises some questions about
the appropriateness of the idea. Professor Karen Mallia describes the promotion in the A Princi-
pled Practicefeature and asks “Why religion? Why a candy bar?” Her answer: “Shock works—
as a combination of norm violation and surprise. Religion is the last taboo. It’s one area creatives
haven’t heavily mined for ideas, because few clients are willing to risk offending people.”
As part of an integrated program, sales promotion has different functions than other marcom
tools. For example, although advertising is designed to build long-term brand awareness, sales
promotion is primarily focused on creating action. Marketing consultant Gerwin explains, “The
objective of advertising is quite different from that of sales promotion. Advertising is usually
viewed as a longer-term investment. Over time, advertising builds brand equity by establishing a
consistent image or feeling for a brand.” In contrast, she explains that “sales promotions are more
immediate, involving a finite time period. Sales promotions offer the consumer something more
tangible.”5
What Are the Primary Categories of Sales Promotion?
The most common sales promotion strategies target the three audiences of promotions: consumer,
trade, and sales force. The first two—customer sales and trade support—have direct implications
for advertising and marketing communication and are the focus of this chapter.
The third category, sales force promotions, are also important in building trade support.
These include two general sets of promotional activities directed at the firm’s salespeople to mo-
tivate them to increase their sales levels. The first set of activities includes programs that better
prepare salespeople to do their jobs, such as sales manuals, training programs, sales presentations,
and supportive materials (training films, slides, videos, and visual aids). The second set of activ-
ities deals with promotional efforts or incentives for retails to use as in-store promotions and other
programs that motivate salespeople to work harder, such as contests.

In the rest of this chapter we examine the two primary categories of promotion—consumer
promotions, then trade promotions. Another section covers other types of promotions that blur the
lines between promotions, advertising, and public relations. Finally, we discuss overarching is-
sues that relate to promotional strategy.

that when consumers go into a store they will look for a particular brand. The primary strengths
of consumer sales promotions are their variety and flexibility, as well as their accountability.
What Are the Tools of Consumer Promotions?
Aproduct manager can use and combine many promotion tech-
niques to meet almost any objective. Sales promotion works for
all kinds of businesses, including movies as The Inside Story
you’ll read later in the chapter illustrates. Here’s a summary of the
most common types of consumer promotions.
• Price DealsApopular sales promotion technique is a price
deal,a temporary price reduction or a sale price, or even free-
bies.Giveawaysof some books, usually those that are in the
public domain, such as Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice,
were used by Amazon.comto promote its Kindle e-reader.6
Amazon also sometimes gives away limited numbers of cer-
tain new titles to spark interest in a new book. The Billings,
Montana, “Trailhead” branding campaign that we discussed
in Chapter 7also used a giveaway to build excitement for the
new brand identity.
Freebies can be a killer if the company doesn’t adequately
predict the consumer response. That happened to KFC when it in-
troduced its new grilled chicken. In what it thought was a great
idea, the KFC promotion team got Oprah to announce a deal for
freebie meals. Unfortunately, KFC wasn’t prepared for the enor-
mous response and its stores ran out of food, angering millions of
customers. Next it tried to make good on its giveaway with down-
loadable coupons from its website, but because of problems on-
line, many customers gave up on that offer as well. Even with all
the bad press, the KFC president found a silver lining: “There’s no
one in America right now who doesn’t know we’re selling grilled
chicken,” he said.7
The four common price deals include:
1. Acents-off dealis a reduction in the normal price charged
for a good or service (for example, “was $1,000, now
$500,” or “50 percent off”) announced at the point of sale or
through mass or direct advertising.
2. Prize-pack dealsprovide the consumer with something ex-
tra through the package itself—a prize in a cereal box, for
instance.
3. Bonus packscontain additional amounts of the product free
when consumers purchase the standard size at the regular
price. For example, Purina Dog Food may offer 25 percent
more dog food in the bag.

• Refunds and RebatesArefundorrebateis a marketer’s offer to return a certain amount of
money to the consumer who purchases the product. Sometimes the refund is a check for a
certain amount of money; at other times it may be a coupon to encourage repeat use.

Sampling is not just an in-store activity. Consider car rentals. AWashington Post
columnist took automakers to task for selling low-budget, stripped down models to car
rental companies. His point was that car rentals are an unrecognized sampling opportunity
and if the experience is uncomfortable or the performance is underwhelming, then the car
maker has suffered a possibly fatal hit to its brand experience. His point: it would make
more sense for an automobile manufacturer to display the best samples of its cars in the
rental market, even if that means selling them to rental car companies at a loss.9
Sampling has also become a mainstay of interactive promotions on the Internet. Some
companies sample their products on their Web page.10Recently, Dove enticed customers
with free samples of its new Dove Body Nourishers and Dove Ultimate Clear deodorant;
however, most farm out the efforts to online companies that specialize in handling sample
offers and fulfillment. Some of these online sampling companies are freesampleclub.com,
startsampling.com,freesamples.com,andsampleville.com.In addition, freebie portals such
asamazingfreebies.com,nojunkfree.com,and the freesite.comhave endless offers for gratis

Retailer-sponsored coupons can be redeemed only at the specified retail outlet.
Manufacturer-sponsored coupons can be redeemed at any outlet distributing the product,
such as the McDonald McCafe brochure, which was filled with coupons for the new cof-
fee offerings. They are distributed directly (direct mail, door-to-door), through media
(newspaper and magazine ads, free-standing inserts), in or on the package itself, or
through the retailer (co-op advertising). Manufacturers pay retailers a fee for handling
their coupons. Coupons have moved online with social marketing sites like Groupon that

Sweepstakes and contests are effective promotional tools for driving people to mar-
keters’Internet sites. As part of the Coke Zero campaign (see Chapter 7), Crispin Porter (cid:2)
Bogusky created the Department of Fannovation and invited NCAAfans to submit ways
to improve the fan experience. Fans downloaded a brief to submit for a chance to win
$10,000 and a trip to the basketball finals. The results from Internet sweepstakes, contests,
and games can be huge because of the multiplier effect of interaction and social media.
• SpecialtiesSpecialty advertisingpresents the brand’s name on something that is given
away in an attempt to remind consumers about the brand. Items include calendars, pens and
pencils, T-shirts, mouse pads, tote bags, and water bottles. The ideal specialty item is one
that is kept out in the open where other people can see it, such as a coffee mug.
Promotional Media The types of sales promotions we just listed can be delivered in various me-
dia, including print, broadcast, and online. Direct mail has dominated the delivery of special pro-
motions but much of that has moved online. The Internet in particular is useful for distributing
coupons, inviting participation in games and sweepstakes, and even in sampling.
Frontier Airlines’favorite animal contest used the Internet effectively to increase Web traffic
with the goal of increasing the online purchase of flights. Advertisers can use the Internet for sales
promotion programs in a number of ways, including sampling, sweepstakes and contests, price
deals, and coupons. The “Bunny” promo for
Frontier was delivered to Frontier’s EarlyReturns
members by e-mail.
Internet promotion is one of the hot areas
of sales promotions. Many advertising cam-
paigns include a campaign-dedicated website,
such as the “microsite” designed as a tie-in. The
Cheetos campaign described in Chapter 6, for
example, was supported with an online website,
Orangeunderground.com, that displayed the
work of a social network of practical jokers com-
mitting Random Acts of Cheetos—in other
words, using Cheetos to turn things orange.
This is an example of an e-mail price promotion sent to Frontier’s Some sites offer price promotions only to
frequent flyers. Even though it’s promoting a sale price, it’s still faithful online purchasers. The promotions might be

frequent flyer miles. Incentive programs offered by online marketers FreeRide Media
(www.freeride.com), MotivationNet (www.mypoints.com), and Netcentives (www.clickrewards
.com) offer discounts to customers who enroll with them before buying from other merchants.
Coupons can be delivered via the Internet. Several sites have been designed for this.
Catalina’s ValuePage Web site (www.valupage.com) allows users to print coupons they can use at
7,000 supermarkets. The coupon is printed with a barcode and is used with the shopper’s store
card. If a product were to offer coupons this way, the site could link the shopper’s Internet infor-
mation with store card information, which the brand manager could use in determining the ef-
fectiveness of the coupon strategy.
Promotional Campaigns Special promotions are usually approached as a campaign because
they involve a variety of media and reach many stakeholders; they also have a limited time frame.
Promotional planners are continually looking for new ways to engage consumers. In particular,
the Internet has opened up new opportunities, with viral media driving a high level of social in-
teraction that reinforces the involvement dimension of promotions. The KitKat promotion dis-
cussed earlier is an example of an innovative use of social media for a promotional idea.
An example of a full-blown promotional campaign is the effort that accompanies the open-
ing of a big budget movie, as described in The Inside Storyfeature on the following page.
How Are Consumer Promotions Used?
Although an action response is the goal of most sales promotions, some programs such as the
Frontier Airlines campaign are designed to build awareness first, but always with action as the ul-
timate goal. Consumers get to choose the animal they like best to represent Frontier, but in the
long run the airline wants consumers to book flights online. What better way to get them to the
site than generating Web traffic via an entertaining contest?
To demonstrate the strategy behind the use of these promotional tools in a new product
launch, let’s suppose we are introducing a new corn chip named King Corn. Promotion is partic-
ularly useful to launch the corn chip because it has a number of tools designed to encourage trial,
but it can also be used later in the brand’s life to maintain or increase its share of market and to
remind and reward loyal customers. Promotions, in other words, deliver on a number of our
Facets of Effects and drive a specific set of objectives.
Awareness Our first challenge is to create awareness of this brand, which is the real strength of
advertising and, you may remember from Chapter 5, the first step in consumer decision making.
However, sometimes awareness can be increased when advertising is combined with an appro-
priate promotion to call attention to the brand name to get people to try the product. Awareness-
building promotion ideas for this new corn chip might include colorful point-of-purchase
displays, sponsorship of a King Corn team, or a special event that will attract people in the target
market.
Trial Creating awareness will only take the product so far, however. Consumers must also per-
ceive King Corn as offering some clear benefit compared to the competition. Sales promotion
does this by arranging for experiences, such as special events where people can try the product or
see it demonstrated. Trial is one of the most important objectives of promotion, but it is essential
to get the right people, the targeted audience, involved with the product. Sales promotion has
other tools that lead to trial, such as sampling. An effective way to get people to try King Corn is
to give away free samples at events, in stores, or through direct mail to the home. Sampling is an
effective strategy for introducing a new or modified product or for dislodging an entrenched mar-
ket leader by enticing potential users to try the product. As a general rule of thumb, retailers and
manufacturers maintain that sampling can boost sales volume as much as 10 times when used
with a product demonstration and 10 to 15 percent thereafter. Sampling is generally most effec-
tive when reinforced on the spot with product coupons. Most consumers like sampling because
they do not lose money if they do not like the product. To be successful, the product sampled must
virtually sell itself with a simple trial experience.

Coupons mainly encourage trial, induce
brand switching, and reward repeat business.
The main advantage of the manufacturer’s
coupon, such as those that run in consumer mag-
azines, is that it allows the advertiser to lower
prices without relying on cooperation from the
retailer to distribute them. Announcements for
cents-off deals include the package itself and
signs near the product or elsewhere in the store.
Advertising for these deals include sales, flyers,
newspaper ads, and broadcast ads.
Maintain or Increase Market Share In addi-
tion to encouraging trial of a new product, an-
other purpose of price deals is to convince
prospective users to switch from an established
competing brand, such as Cheetos in the King
Corn case. Later, after the King Corn brand is es-
tablished, a price deal can be used to reward
loyal users and encourage their repeat business.
Price deals are particularly effective in those sit-
uations where price is an important factor in
brand choice or if consumers are not brand loyal.
To maintain a brand’s presence, increase its
market share, or counter competitive actions,
marketers use promotional tools such as
coupons, premiums, special events, and contests The Blue Bunny brochure uses strong appetite appeal in its visuals to

tures the entire Indulge line of low-carb and low-
fat products, as well as coupons to encourage trial.
In addition to serving as a reward for buying a product, premiums can enhance an advertis-
ing campaign or a brand’s image. Characters like the Campbell’s Soup Kids, Tony the Tiger,
Cap’n Crunch, and Ronald McDonald are used on premiums, such as soup or cereal bowls, to re-
inforce the consumer’s association of the brand with the character. Cereal manufacturers are
among the biggest users of in-pack premiums as reminder devices.
Brand Reminder In addition to new product launches, promotions are also used in the reminder
stage. This means that you change advertising copy to remind customers about the positive ex-
perience they had with the product and use sales promotion to reinforce their loyalty with
coupons, rebates, and other rewards. After the initial purchase you want the customer to remem-
ber the brand and repeat the purchase, so specialty items, such as a King Corn snack bowl, can
serve as a brand reminder. Specialty advertising serves as a reminder to the consumer to consider
the product. Specialties also build relationships, such as items given away as New Year or thank-
you gifts (the calendar hanging in the kitchen). Advertisers use specialty items to thank customers
for patronage, to reinforce established products or services, and to generate sales leads.
TRADE PROMOTIONS
Consumer awareness and desire mean nothing unless King Corn is available where the consumer
thinks it should be. Somehow the trade must be convinced that the product will move off the
shelves. Marketers know they must engage the trade in the program if their consumer promotions

one business is promoting its services to another, which also includes personal sales and materi-
als used in sales presentations. An example comes from Kuni Automotive, a small group of auto
dealerships that was pitching the smart car company to get dealerships in Portland, Seattle, and
Denver. Karl Schroeder, copywriter at the Coates Kokes agency in Portland, explained the Big
Idea behind the sales presentation kit his team designed to win the dealerships. Kuni “needed
something that would stand out and give them instant name recognition with the people at smart.”
The idea was to send a set of kits before sending the official paperwork proposal. “They were all
shrink wrapped. They came with scissors, glue, colors, points of interest for each city, smart cars,
dealership buildings, and even customers ready to buy.” Kuni was successful in winning two
smart centers in Portland and Denver with this promotion.
Typically companies spend more than half of their total promotion budget on promotions di-
rected at the trade, which is to say that although consumer promotion is highly visible, trade pro-
motion is equally important as a marketing communication strategy. Let’s look at the types of
trade promotion.
What Are the Types of Trade Promotion?

• Trade Incentives and DealsSimilar to con-
sumer price deals, a manufacturer may re-
ward a reseller financially for purchase of a
certain level of a product or support of a
promotion. These promotional efforts can
take the form of special displays, extra pur-
chases, superior store locations, or greater
local promotion. In return, retailers can re-
ceive special allowances, such as discounts, Nintendo launched its Wii game with demonstrations at entertainment

turer. The most common types of trade
dealsare buying allowances for increasing
purchases and advertising allowances, which include deals on cooperative advertising and
display allowances, or deals for agreeing to use promotional displays.
• ContestsAs in the case of consumer sales promotion, advertisers can develop contests and
sweepstakes to motivate resellers. Contests are far more common than sweepstakes, mainly
because resellers find it easy to tie contest prizes to the sale of the sponsor’s product. Asales
quota is set, for example, and the retailer or person who exceeds the quota by the largest per-
centage wins the contest.

• Trade Shows and ExhibitsThetrade showis a place where companies within the same in-
dustries gather to present and sell their merchandise and to demonstrate their products. Ex-
hibits are the spaces that are designed to showcase the product.
How Is Trade Promotion Used?
The ultimate gauge of a successful trade promotion is whether sales increase. Trade promotions
are primarily designed to get the cooperation of people in the distribution channel and to encour-
age their promotion of the product to consumers. Sales promotion brings resellers to that point of
conviction. There are two primary roles for a trade promotion:
1. Trade SupportTo stimulate in-store merchandising or other trade support (for example,
feature pricing, superior store location, or shelf space)
2. ExcitementTo create a high level of excitement about the product among those responsi-
ble for its sale.
In addition, trade promotion is also used to accomplish other marketing objectives, such as mani-
pulating levels of inventory held by wholesalers and retailers and expanding product distribution
to new areas of the country or new classes of trade.
Demand: Push-and-Pull Strategies As explained in Chapter 3, manufacturers hope to see their
trade partners push a product. To understand the role of trade promotion, consider how sales pro-
motion is used in push-and-pull strategies. Consumer and trade promotions interact through

push-and-pull strategies. can be used to intensify demand for the product. By conducting a contest in conjunction with
sampling, for example, we can increase the pull of a promotion at the same time we get people
to try the new product.
However, you might use a push strategy to push the product through the channel by con-
vincing (motivating or rewarding) members of the distribution network to carry King Corn. For
example, we want grocery stores not only to carry them, but also to allocate good shelf space in
the crowded chip aisle. Here are the most common types of incentives and trade deals used with
retailers as part of a push strategy:
• BonusesAmonetary bonus, also called push moneyorspiffs,is paid to a salesperson based
on units the salesperson sells over a period of time. For example, an air conditioner manu-
facturer might give salespeople a $50 bonus for the sale of one model and $75 for a fancier
model, within a certain time frame. At the end of the sales period, each salesperson sends in
evidence of total sales to the manufacturer and receives a check for the bonus amount.
• Dealer LoaderThese are premiums, comparable to a consumer premium, that a manufac-
turer gives to a retailer for buying a certain amount of a product. Abuying loader rewards re-
tailers for buying the product. Budweiser offered store managers a free trip to the Super
Bowl if they sold a certain amount of beer in a specified period of time. Display loaders re-
ward retailers by giving them the display after the promotion ends. For example, Dr. Pepper
built a store display for the July 4th holiday that included a gas grill, picnic table, basket,
and other items. The store manager was awarded these items after the promotion ended.
• Buying AllowancesAmanufacturer pays a reseller a set amount of money or offers a dis-
count for purchasing a certain amount of the product during a specified time period.
• Advertising AllowancesThe manufacturer pays the wholesaler or retailer a certain amount
of money to advertise the manufacturer’s product. This allowance can be a flat dollar
amount, or it can be a percentage of gross purchases during a specified time period.
• Co-op AdvertisingIn a contractual arrangement between the manufacturer and the resellers,
the manufacturer agrees to pay a part or all of the retailers’advertising expenses.
• Display AllowanceAdirect payment of cash or goods is given to the retailer if the retailer
agrees to set up the point-of-sale display.
Attention Some trade promotions are designed to get the attention of both trade members and
their customers. PoPdisplays, a promotional tool we mentioned earlier, are designed to get the
attention of shoppers when they are in the store and to stimulate impulse purchases. They are used
by retailers, but provided by manufacturers. As we have moved to a self-service retail environ-
ment in which fewer and fewer customers expect help from sales clerks, the importance of PoP
materials continues to increase. POPAI has found that the PoPforms that have the greatest im-
pact on sales are displays that tie in with entertainment, sports, or charities.
In the Practical Tipsfeature, marketing consultant Arlene Gerwin explains how best to plan
effective PoPpromotions.
In addition to getting attention in crowded aisles and promoting impulse purchases, mar-
keters are designing PoPefforts to complement other promotional campaigns. As part of getting
attention, retailers appreciate PoPideas that build store ambience. Club Med designed a floor dis-
play for travel agents that featured a beach chair with a surfboard on one side and a pair of skis
on the other to show that Club Med has both snow and sun destinations. Advertisers must design
PoPdisplays that appeal to both end users and the trade. Retailers will use a PoPonly if they are
convinced that it will generate greater sales.
Motivation Most trade promotions are designed to, in some way, motivate trade members to co-
operate with the manufacturer’s promotion. Incentives such as contests and trade deals are used.
If conducted properly with a highly motivating incentive or prize, contests can spur short-term
sales and improve the relationship between the manufacturer and the reseller. They encourage a
higher quantity of purchases and create enthusiasm among trade members who are involved with

Information Trade shows display products and provide an opportunity to sample and demon-
strate products, particularly for trade buyers, the people who buy for stores. The food industry has
thousands of trade shows for various product categories, and the manufacturer of King Corn
would want to sponsor an exhibit featuring the new corn chip at the appropriate food shows. Trade
shows permit companies to gather information about their competition. In an environment where
all the companies are attempting to give a clear picture of their products to potential customers,
competitors can easily compare quality, features, prices, and technology.
MULTIPLATFORM PROMOTIONS
So far we have looked at consumer sales promotions and trade promotions. But marketers have
more promotion techniques at their disposal. In this section, we focus on sponsorships, event mar-
keting, loyalty programs, and co-marketing or partnership promotions. Many of these promotion
532 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
techniques, such as sponsorships and event marketing, cross over to other areas of marketing and
blur the lines between promotions, advertising, and public relations.
Sponsorships and Event Marketing
Sponsorshipsoccur when companies support an event, say, a sporting event, concert, or charity,
either financially or by donating supplies and services. Event marketingmeans building a prod-
uct’s marketing program around a sponsored event, such as the Olympics or a golf tournament.
Both are used because of the excitement they generate for both the consumer and trade audiences.

An innovative example of street-based promotional events comes from New York City,
which has closed parts of Broadway to create pedestrian plazas. In addition to civic activities,
companies can rent these spaces for commercial events such as when the Bravo Network’s Top
Chefcooking competition held a promotion there, or when Glidden Paint set up large paint can
product literature displays and a team of young men and women in bright-colored T-shirts handed
out paint chips and advice on colors and decorating.15
Sponsorships typically cost a lot of money. Sponsors for major golf tournaments, for exam-
ple, are expected to invest between $6 million and $8 million. The A Matter of Practicebox dis-
cusses the explosion of sports-related promotions.
Companies undertake sponsorships to build brand associations and increase the perceived
value of the brand in the consumer’s mind. The important thing is that the event must project the
right image for the brand. That’s particularly important in troubled economic times when com-
panies with budget problems find it hard to justify spending money on glitzy events. Companies
that use sponsorships focus their efforts on supporting causes and events that matter most to em-
ployees and customers. Unilever signed on as sponsor for the Today Show’sfood and recipe web-
site, called Cooking School. The idea is to feature Unilever’s brands, such as Bertolli, Country
Crock, and Ragu. Although the most common sponsorships are around events, particularly sport-
ing events, brands can also sponsor product-related websites that are particularly effective at cre-
ating sales or recruiting people. The 2BLIKEu.com network is a consumer products social
network that lets companies sponsor product pages.
Hundreds of companies sponsor NASCAR cars both to reach the sport’s expanding fan base
and to link their brand to a winning car and driver. Sponsors shell out in excess of $650 million
to get NASCAR’s top 35 cars in the Nextel Cup Series to put their logos on the car. The invest-
ment pays. Marketing analysts estimate that Dale Earnhardt, Jr., earns the equivalent of $150 mil-
lion in televised exposure time for his sponsor Budweiser, quite a bargain considering
Anheuser-Busch, and other sponsors, spend much less on the sponsorships.
Just think about sponsorships associated with football bowl games and other sporting events.
The first bowl to have a sponsor, the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl, led the way in 1986, followed by the
Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, the Outback Bowl, the Meinecke Car Care Bowl, and others. Atwist on the
sports sponsorship concept comes from convenience store chain 7-Eleven, which made a deal
with the Chicago White Sox that their games would start at 7:11. Of course, when the club lost
the 7-Eleven sponsorship, it also got a new start time—7:10.
The importance of sponsorships is growing worldwide. Mengniu Milk, a Mongolian milk
company, raised its profile by backing the NBAin China. Beyond exposure, these events give
corporations the opportunity to build their image and reputation by associating with an activity
that audiences enjoy.16
Event Marketing The term event marketingdescribes the practice of linking a brand to an event,
such as the Jose Cuervo beach volleyball tournament. Marketers use related promotional events,
such as a tour or the appearance of the product or its spokesperson at a mall or sporting event, to
gain the attention and participation of people in the target audience who attend the event. The
event showcases the brand, often with sampling, coupons, other incentives, and attention-getting
stunts. To be successful, the event must match the brand to the target market’s lifestyle.

The online firm sent employees to airports to pay for airline customers’baggage fees. The stunt

Business-to-business promotions also use events to reach trade audiences, which can include
the sales staff, distributors, retailers, and franchisees. These stakeholders are invited to participate
in the event as a reward for their support.
The granddaddy of all events is the Super Bowl, which is also an Ad Bowl as there some-
times is as much interest in the advertising as in the game. The ads are the most expensive on tel-
evision; prices can top $3 million for a 30-second commercial—and that’s just the cost of the

time. Don’t forget there is a significant budget tied up in the production of the commercials be-
cause they have to be highly professional in order to justify the costs. The reason these costs make
sense is because they also reach huge audience. The 2010 game, which featured the New Orleans
Saints winning their first Super Bowl at the expense of the favored Indianapolis Colts, broke all
audience records for viewership to become the most watched program in history.
It’s not just the commercials, however, that get the attention of marketers. The TVspots are
also the opportunity for wide-ranging promotional campaigns that involve publicity, PoP dis-
plays, video clips, websites and social media, search-engine ads, and relationship programs with
important partners, such as retailers and shareholders. YouTube, for example, gets involved by
sponsoring a Super Bowl Ad Blitz channel where viewers can vote for their favorite spots. View-
ers are known to rewatch spots online on YouTube, AOL, Yahoo!, and other sites. They also pass
along favorite commercials to friends and family.

Ambush marketing is the term given to promotional stunts used at events, such as the
Olympics and the soccer and rugby World Cups, by companies that are not official sponsors. Am-
bush marketing typically occurs when one brand is trying to undermine the presence of a com-
petitor that is sponsoring an event. If it can create enough confusion, it can reduce the return on
the official sponsor’s investment at the same time it can pick up additional visibility through pub-

probably heard of the Goodyear blimp, but other
companies sponsor dirigibles as well. MetLife,
which uses characters from the popular Peanuts comic strip in its advertising, has two blimps,
Snoopy I and Snoopy II, that connect with the corporate campaign to provide brand reminder
messages. Inflatables, giant models of products, characters, and packages, are used at all kinds of
events, including grand openings, sporting events, parades, trade shows, beaches, malls, and other
places where they can make an impression for a new product rollout. Agiant inflatable, such as
Spider-Man on a building, demands attention and provides an entertaining and highly memorable
product presentation. Its effectiveness comes from its huge size and three-dimensional shape.
Loyalty Programs
Another type of program that crosses the line between advertising and promotion is frequency, or
loyalty, programs. Aloyalty program,also called a continuityorfrequencyprogram (such as
airline frequent flyer programs), is a promotion to increase customer retention. Marketers typi-
cally design loyalty programs to keep and reward customers for their continued patronage, which
is why they are called continuity programs. Typically, the higher the purchase level, the greater
the benefits.
Today loyalty programs are synonymous with the word frequent.The frequent flyer club,
first created by United and American Airlines in 1981, is the model for a modern continuity pro-
gram. These programs offer a variety of rewards, including seat upgrades, free tickets, and pre-
miums based on the number of frequent flyer miles accumulated. Although the frequent flyer
programs were originally established to create customer loyalty, they have turned into a rewards
program. For example, people can earn miles through credit card purchases. Continuity programs
work in competitive markets in which the consumer has difficulty perceiving real differences be-
tween brands. TGI Friday’s, for example, has used a “Frequent Fridays” program with several
million members. The key to creating a successful loyalty program is offering memorable incen-
tives that consumers want.
Marketerslikemembershipprogramsbecausetheyalsogenerateinformationforcustomer

Licensing With licensing,legally protected brand identity
items, such as logos, symbols, and brand characters, must be
licensed—that is, a legal contract gives another company the
right to use the brand identity element. In brand licensing, a
company with an established brand “rents” that brand to
other companies, allowing them to use its logo on their prod-
ucts and in their advertising and promotional events. Fashion
marketers such as Gucci, Yves St. Laurent, and Pierre Cardin
have licensed their brand names and logos for use on every-
thing from fashion accessories to sunglasses, ties, linens, and
luggage, and they do this because it makes them money and
extends their brand visibility. The PGATour is a golf brand
that has become recognizable through an elaborate, inte-
grated marketing campaign. Charles Schwab, the financial
investment house, has used the PGATour logo as a part of its
advertising. This lets the company associate its brand with a
golf event that has a lot of interest and positive associations
for the target audiences.
Tie-Ins and Cross Promotions Another type of cooperative
marketing program is a tie-inorcross promotion,which is
an effective strategy for marketers using associations be-
tween complementary brands to make one plus one equal
three. For example, Doritos may develop a tie-in promotion

The promotion also was supported with a PoP

The biggest cross promotions are arranged
around movies and other entertainment events.

achieve a bigger impact in the marketplace. Typ-
ically, marketers align themselves with partners
that provide numerous complementary elements, including common target audiences, purchase
cycle patterns, distribution channels, retailer penetration, and demographics to drive their prod-
ucts and promotions through retail channels and into the minds of consumers.
An interesting, although questionable, promotion was Bud Light’s use of “Fan Cans” in col-
lege colors. It raised questions about licensing and rogue “tie-in” strategies that aren’t sanctioned
by the schools. In the fall of 2009, Anheuser-Busch had a great idea to tie in with the start of col-
lege football season by issuing Bud Light in cans with collegiate colors, some 27 different color
combinations to be exact. “Show your true colors with Bud Light” the promotional materials an-
nounced. Retailers reported that Bud Light’s “Fan Can” promotion seemed to be a hit among foot-
ball fans in those cities where wholesalers choose to participate.19
Several problems surfaced with this promotion. Some universities complained that the col-
ored cans infringed on the schools’trademark licensing. Anheuser-Busch agreed not to offer the
promotion in areas where the schools protested. Others complained that it promoted drinking
among students, many of whom were underage. AFederal Trade Commission senior attorney,
Janet Evans, followed up on that complaint expressing “grave concern” about its impact on un-
derage drinking.
The company responded that it takes the problem of underage drinking very seriously.
Anheuser-Busch’s vice president of corporate social responsibility explained that these cans were
only being made available in communities where purchasers must be age 21 or older to drink.
Anheuser-Busch stood by its rights to sell Bud Light using colors associated with universities—
and to sell these cans to college fans. Furthermore, there are lots of fans who are not underage and
think the game-day promotion is cool.

Promotion Objectives
Our earlier discussion of the use of promotion identified a number of reasons for using promo-
tions, and these can easily be translated into objectives. Many of the reasons focused on the use
538 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
of promotions in a new product launch and how that can deliver trial. Promotions can offer con-
sumers an immediate inducement to try or buy a product, often simply by making the product
more valuable. Sales promotions can make consumers who know nothing about the brand de-
velop awareness and trial and persuade them to buy the product again once they’ve tried it. It can
push the product through the distribution channel by generating positive brand experiences
among resellers and buyers in many places along the channel and purchase continuum.

Promotions are not effective in achieving all marketing objectives. For example, promotions
alone cannot create an image for a brand. They cannot do much to change negative attitudes to-
ward a product, overcome product problems, or reposition a brand. Brand building, however, is
an interesting challenge to promotion, so let’s look at it in more depth.
The Issue of Brand Building For years a heated debate has focused on sales promotion and
brandbuilding.Advertisersclaimthestrengthofadvertisingiscreatingandmaintainingbrand
image,andsalespromotion’spricedealsactuallynegatealltheirhardworkbydivertingtheem-
phasis from the brand to the price.The result, sales promotion critics complain, is a brand-

messagethatcompaniesaresensitivetocustomers’needsandadjustingitspricesinordertobe
supportive.
Procter & Gamble’s division manager of advertising and sales promotion explains it this
way: “Too many marketers no longer adhere to the fundamental premise of brand building, which
is that [brand] franchises aren’t built by cutting price but rather by offering superior quality at a
reasonable price and clearly communicating that value to consumers.” The price-cutting promo-
tions began in the 1970s fostering a buy-only-on-sale orientation that some branding experts be-
lieve has caused long-term brand building to suffer. Critics point to a general decline in consumer
brand loyalty as just one negative result of price-based promotions.
The problem is that brand building is a long and time-consuming process of establishing the
brand’s core values. Promotion, whether a sale price, premium, coupon, or some other incentive,
is inherently short term, so the promotion can undermine the brand’s established values if not han-
dled carefully. Analyst Doug Brookes says that even in economic downturns promotion strategies
can be designed to balance both long-term brand building and short-term price promotion with
the help of predictive analytic techniques that optimize ROI.20
Sales promotion experts argue that their practices can help to build brand image. They refer
to many cereal brands, rental car companies, airlines, and hotels that have used a variety of well-
planned sales promotion strategies (like loyalty programs, for example) to enhance their brand
images. An example comes from a classic promotional ad for Eagle Shirtmakers. Second, they
acknowledge that continuous promotion—particularly continuous price promotion—does not
work well with brand building, except for discount marketers, whose image is built on the notion
of sale prices, although even Walmart is rethinking its “always low prices” positioning strategy.
According to one industry expert, the solution is to make advertising more accountable and
promotion more brand focused. In other words, the advertising and promotion need to work more
closely together and, in particular, short-term campaigns shouldn’t be at odds with one another.
More integration is needed when planning marketing communication programs.
Promotion Integration
Advertising and promotion both contribute to the effectiveness of a marketing communication
plan, primarily because they do different things and have different objectives. In an effective plan,
CHAPTER 17 • PROMOTIONS 539
CLASSIC
San Francisco ad man Howard Gossage was known for his sense of humor and tongue-in-the-cheek promotional ideas. This ad for Eagle
Shirtmakers featured what you might call a premium—a handkerchief made from the shirt fabric, which also made it a sample. The wry
copy is in classic Gossage ad writing style.
the two work together, along with other marketing communication tools, to accomplish the over-
all marketing communication objectives.
The major differences between advertising and sales promotion concern their methods of ap-
peal and the value they add to the sale of the product or service. Advertising is primarily used to
create a brand image and high levels of brand awareness over time; promotions are primarily used
to create immediate action. To accomplish this immediate goal, sales promotion may rely heavily
on rational appeals, such as price deals. In contrast, advertising often relies on emotional appeals
to promote the product’s image. In other words, advertising tends to add intangible value—brand
personality and image—to the good or service. Promotions add tangible value to the good or ser-
vice and contribute greatly to the profitability of the brand.
Here is a summary of the differences between these two marketing tools in terms of their pri-
mary orientations:

• Creates a brand image over time. • Creates immediate action.
• Relies on emotional appeals. • Added value strategies rely on rational appeals;
impulse appeals use emotion.

An example of a multiplatform promotion that demonstrates how a variety of media and
tools can work together was the Voyeur Project for HBO that won a Grand Prix at the Cannes
Film Festival. The idea for the promotional campaign was to project a massive film on the wall
of a building in New York showing the illusion of looking inside eight fictional apartments. Each
apartment and its inhabitants depicted a different story, which reinforced HBO’s position as “the
greatest storyteller in the world.”

found online on Web mini-sites, as well as in photo and video clips on social media platforms,
such as Flickr and YouTube. It was an event, an outdoor advertising experience, an online expe-
rience, and it involved many bloggers who followed the stories and commented to their digital
communities. See the film at www.youtube.com/watch?v(cid:4)QCr853VVo9c
Promotion Effectiveness
Because promotions are so focused on action, it makes sense that sales volume is the primary
measure of their effectiveness. After all, they are called sales promotions. Response rate—
consumers calling the company, sending back a card—is also important to sales promotion. So
are redemption rates, which are the rates at which people redeem coupons, refunds, and rebates.
These rates are used to evaluate the effectiveness of promotional programs. All of these will be
discussed in more detail in Chapter 19.
An important dimension of sales promotion effectiveness is payout planning. The goal of
creating a payout plan is to produce promotions that increase sales and profits. Needless to say, a
promotion should not cost the company more money than it brings in.

The trade press is full of stories about poorly designed or performing promotions. Such fail-
ures hurt companies’reputations, waste money, and sometimes even hurt consumers. For exam-
ple, Burger King once had to recall 400,000 toy boats given away with kids’meals after reports
that children had been stuck with metal pins that came off the boats too easily. That recall came
a week after McDonald’s recalled a Happy Meal “Scooter Bug” toy. In 1999 the fast-food indus-
try reeled from the deaths of two infants who suffocated from containers used in a Pokémon pro-
motion. About 25 million of those toys were recalled.
CHAPTER 17 • PROMOTIONS 541
Looking Ahead
As you’ve read in this chapter, promotions can successfully deliver sales to a company, but they
must be well planned and executed if they are to enhance the brand’s reputation. The next chap-
ter, which will wrap up our discussion of IMC, as well as introduce various specialized areas of
marketing communication, will also reinforce the idea that all the tools we have presented in this
book must work together to create a consistent and coherent brand image.
IT’S A WRAP
Consumers Vote
Frontier the Winner
Similar to the “Flip to Mexico” campaign (described in the opening case in Chapter 8), Frontier’s “Denver’s
Favorite Animal” campaign proved to be a winner. Fans engaged in the democratic process in a mock elec-
tion, posting more than 4,000 entries on the forum and logging more than a million votes.
Recognizing that all the candidates were male, more than 1,000 fans signed a petition to draft the only
female animal, Foxy the Fox, into the race. Even the White House Project, an organization that supports
women in politics, got into the act, creating its own “Draft Foxy” commercial and posting a story online urg-
ing people to vote for Foxy as Denver’s favorite animal.
In case you were wondering, the Penguins were announced the winners of the favorite animal contest in
a 60-second commercial that ran during the last half hour of the Academy Awards. Maybe they had a little
bump in popularity from Happy Feet, a movie about penguins that won an Academy Award for Best Animated
Feature Film that same night.
Frontier won big, too. Web traffic was up more than 50 percent over the same period in the previous year.
Online bookings increased 18 percent. Another benefit—online enrollments in Frontier’s frequent flyer pro-
gram increased by about a third. Throughout the campaign, the much-talked about campaign garnered an
estimated value in ad equivalency dollars from exposure on TV news, newspaper stories, PR releases and
events, and social networking, proving that the characters were more popular than ever.
Frontier’s advertising has been recognized with more than 80 awards. Frontier won a Gold Effie for sus-
tained success. The advertising was nominated for Best of Show at the International Mobius Awards for two
years in a row. It was awarded a Silver Clio for the prestigious Content & Contact category and won a Silver
Effie as well. A 2010 ad for a 43-hour super sale that ran during Super Bowl XLIII (43) also received top hon-
ors in the sustained success campaign category of the North American Effie Awards. “Denver’s Favorite Ani-
mal” campaign received a nomination for a National Emmy for Outstanding Achievement in Advanced Media
Technology. It won further recognition, along with creators Couzens and Ennis when it was selected as one of
the “Amazing Animal Ads” aired on Animal Planet.

Match CR-V to Your Lifestyle*
After winning a gold Effie for an advertising campaign leading to outstanding
sales results, what do you do for an encore?
The advertising business is a “what-have-you-done-for-me-lately” kind of busi-
ness. A lot of clients are only as happy as their latest advertising campaign results.
Having taken the Honda CR-V from being a distant fourth as the most sold
small SUV in Iceland to a close second with a successful marketing campaign, what
can you do to top the results? You make it the number one selling small SUV in the
country.
The Honda dealership in Iceland challenged us to make the new-from-the-
ground-up CR-V the best selling small SUV in Iceland. Like most new car models,
the new CR-V was more luxurious and more expensive than its predecessor. To
meet the challenge of becoming number one, the new CR-V was completely
changed visually to cast a less rugged and more urban image.
The Icelandic climate, road conditions, and mentality have always inflated the
need for four-wheel-drive vehicles. Much like in the United States, the better per-
formance of four-wheel-drive vehicles has increased the demand for such vehicles
in the last decade and a half. Close to half the vehicles sold in Iceland were four-
wheel drive, but the majority of those were full-size SUVs or pickups.
Most ads for the SUV segment focused on off-road capabilities and mountain
activities. Our earlier research showed that the people buying those types of vehi-
cles were not necessarily involved in those activities. Rather, we found that what
people wanted from those cars was mostly space, both for people and stuff (gro-
ceries, luggage, kids, and sporting equipment), and minimum off-road capabilities.
They wanted the ability to drive on dirt and gravel roads and the benefit of not be-
ing stuck in town (or at home) on heavy snow days.
Having successfully analyzed the market to maximize sales of the older version
of the CR-V by carving out a unique identity in the Icelandic market and stressing
the extra urban connection with the target group, we now had to expand on our
market research to find a new niche to match the newer version.

Our research also showed that the Honda brand was seen as high quality, well
built, and reliable. Furthermore, the last campaign had managed to change the im-
age from a car that was expensive and dull to one that was a great value (although
not inexpensive) and safe.
We needed a strategy that could build on the previous campaigns.
We set very ambitious objectives. In year 1 we intended to lower the average
age of the new CR-V buyer from 47 years old to 45 years old. We aimed to increase
strong purchase intent for the Honda SUV for those under 40 years old to 30 per-
cent (an increase of 20 percent), while maintaining the status quo among older buy-
ers. We also aimed to move the top-of-mind scores to fourth place among all car
brands (up two spots). This goal helped support the sales objective of increasing
sales to a 12 percent market share in the small SUV segment. Historically, reaching
this goal would be enough to be make the CR-V the highest seller in the market.
We had good insight from our previous campaigns for the older generation
CR-Vs. So we decided to simplify the message and exploit it further by taking the
campaign all urban. We would go all in on the prospect’s lifestyle and the car’s ur-
ban connection with the key phrase “Match CR-V . . . [to your lifestyle].”
We built a campaign positioning the CR-V as “an ultra inner-city SUV with
space and maneuverability for your daily activities.” At the same time, competitors
were promoting their small SUVs as sport SUVs or off-roaders.
Our Big Idea was to challenge the target group to compare the new CR-V to
their lifestyle. Their real usage was mostly for daily chores: grocery shopping, driv-
ing children to school, and so on, with a light mixture of rural activities.
All our headlines challenged the target group to match the car to specific
tasks, chores, and situations. All headlines started with the challenge “Match CR-V
. . .” and were the building blocks for universal themes in all promotional materials
for the CR-V, making good use of digital media and promotional activities along
with more traditional media. When tested these headlines were shown to engage
the target group and their imaginations. Different target groups identified with dif-
ferent headlines.
The result was beyond our dreams. You can find out more about what we
achieved by turning to the end of the chapter and reading It’s a Wrap.
The Honda CR-Vcase is about an award-winning integrated campaign that illustrates how inter-
national marketers make decisions about their local advertising. It combines two of the subjects
we cover in this chapter, integration and international advertising. Other topics in this chapter are
retail, business-to-business (B2B), and nonprofit marketing communication. All these specialized
areas use many of the basic marketing communication IMC principles and generally strive to co-
ordinate their messages; however, there are some distinct differences that we will call to your at-
tention in this chapter.
IMC MANAGEMENT
We’re near the end of this book. If you have any interest in working in marketing or marketing
communication, what have you learned about integrated marketing communication that might
help you in your career? The industry is definitely moving in that direction. Astudy by the As-
sociation of National Advertisers (ANA) in 2008, for example, found that 74 percent of ANA
members said they were using IMC for most or all of their brands. The association’s CEO sees
that as a call for “Renaissance Marketers” who understand the essentials of IMC. He describes
CHAPTER 18 • THE IMC UMBRELLA 547
them as “a new breed of holistic professionals who are system thinkers, customer-centric be-
lievers, innovators, and dreamers.”1 So there’s definitely a job opportunity here—does that
sound like you?
Maybe you’re even thinking about starting a business or going to graduate school and be-
coming a consultant. If so, it’s important to understand the concept of advertising has broadened
to include almost everything that sends a brand message, a practice we have been calling IMC. If
you go to work in marketing or marketing communication, you may be asked to help plan an IMC
campaign. So let’s wrap up our chapters on the various types of marketing communication and
see how what you’ve learned in this book fits together from a manager’s perspective.
One lesson you may have learned is that in marketing communication campaigns, the ob-
jective is to create consistency among all the marcom tools. That’s essentially a tactical approach,
one that’s focused on orchestrating consistent brand messages. In the Part 5 opener, Duncan re-
ferred to this as a “one-voice, one-look” strategy, which is a critical goal for campaigns. So let’s
look at the type of IMC planning that delivers marketing communication consistency. Then we’ll
turn to the big picture of managing a total brand communicationprogram.
Managing IMC Campaigns

the creative theme and the consistent presentation of the brand position and personality, even
when different stakeholders groups receive different types of messages and interact with the
brandindifferentways.
Consistency is a product of a carefully designed multiplatform and multimedia plan. For ex-
ample, consider the CR-Vcampaign. The agency’s owner, Ingvi Logason, explained:
The media emphasis had been on print with support from TVand the Internet. We shifted
the emphasis to a 360-degree integrated approach where we focused, among other things,
on media with large reach at the expense of high frequency. TVand interactive Web ban-
ners were at the forefront of the campaign with support from newspaper, radio, and event
marketing. We also extended the traditional media with sponsorship of some big sports and
cultural events that tied in with the car owners’lifestyles.

The IMC Mix The decision about which marcom tools to use in a campaign is based on an
analysis of their strengths and weaknesses and how they can best be employed to meet the cam-
paign’s objectives. As we explained in Chapter 7, certain tools are better at delivering specific ob-
jectives. Table 18.1 provides a more extensive outline of the tools and their objectives. As you
look over the list, think about what’s required to launch a new product. In that situation, which
tools would you select as the most appropriate?
Managing 360-Degree Communication
Another lesson you may have learned from our previous discussions is that IMC is a philosophy,
a way of managing a brand with a singular vision of what the brand stands for. Unlike the short-
term IMC campaign approach, this is a philosophy that delivers total communication over the
life of a brand. We are calling this 360-degree communicationbecause a unifying brand vision

surrounds all the brand’s interactions with all its stakeholders—and this vision must be shared by
everyone involved with the brand.
At this “total communication” level, a manager’s goal is to monitor all brand experiences to
ensure they are working together to support the brand vision. As we have said, messages are de-
livered by every element of the marketing mix, as well as every marcom message and every brand
experience at every brand contact point.
The problem is departmental siloswith each marcom function going its own way. The solu-
tion according to the ANAreport cited earlier is “a team of colleagues who have the responsibil-
ity vision, understanding, and commitment to engage in a media-agnostic planning process.”3The
only way to monitor and plan for a diversity of brand communication is through cross-functional
management.Departmental silos that generate inconsistent messages is an organizational prob-
lem and every department involved in delivering the brand message should be part of the team
that monitors and plans the brand communication. The point is that you can’t be integrated ex-
ternally if you are not integrated internally.

not integrated internally. when the new chief executive at Ford realized that what the troubled car company needed after
the auto meltdown of the late 2000s was a unifying vision. To rally the troops, he had a motivat-
ing vision printed on laminated, wallet-size cards and given to the thousands of Ford employees.
It proclaimed: “One Ford . . . One Team . . . One Plan. . . . One Goal.” The statement conveyed a
strategy for returning Ford to its leadership position and undergirded the launch of the Ford Fo-
cus, the firm’s first truly global car.4
A Management Case Study On the big picture level, IMC is both a philosophy of management
and a tool for creating and monitoring total brand communication. The best example comes from
the Tokyo-based Dentsu agency, which has aimed at providing total communication serviceto its
clients for decades.5But until the 2000s, the agency was only able to do multimedia coordination
CHAPTER 18 • THE IMC UMBRELLA 549
at a one-voice, one-look level. New technology and a new management philosophy, however, cre-
ated a new way of doing business.
To truly operate with an IMC orientation, Dentsu underwent a total reorganization and de-
signed a comprehensive new IMC toolkit. Now the giant agency’s employees have sophisticated
tools to actually deliver on that total communication promise with a more advanced approach that
Dentsu calls IMC 2.0. It defines IMC 2.0 as “an ongoing systematic process for creatively plan-
ning, production, and evaluating brand communication that creates customer relationships, builds
strong brands, and increases sales and profits.”6
To engineer this turnaround, it first held an IMC audit, conducted by IMC leader Professor
Tom Duncan, to determine its IMC strengths and weakness internally, as well as in the eyes of
key clients. Then it created an IMC Development Division with the mission of undertaking the
IMC R&D arm. That division has some 90 to 100 staff members dedicated to basic research into
IMC processes. The agency also created an IMC online site with more than 250 planning tools,
models, and processes that can be used in IMC 2.0 projects. This portal also provides access to
case studies, training modules, articles, and research on IMC. It registers more than 2,000 unique
visits a day from Dentsu employees.
An IMC Planning Center with 350 people from a variety of media and marcom areas was
established. The staff members assigned to this department are given intensive IMC training so
they have the skills to work in cross-functional IMC teams on client projects brought to them by
various account groups. The agency’s Brand Creation Center, an existing brand consulting group,
was also integrated into the IMC Planning Center. Finally, each of Dentsu’s 22 account groups
has 5 to 10 embedded account planners who are trained in IMC practices. These planners help ed-
ucate clients on the goals of IMC and establish a common language for planning.
It’s a work in progress—and one complicated by the worldwide recession—but Dentsu’s
IMC executives and managers believed that the investment in reorganization was justified. The
effort didn’t come cheap: Dentsu initially dedicated some 600 of its 4,500 employees to IMC de-
velopment and client services.
The Management of Synergy We have mentioned elsewhere in the book that one goal of inte- Tenth Principle of IMC

together, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
Another way to understand this synergy in the IMC
context is the say–do–confirm integration triangle. This Say
triangle identifies three key aspects that must work to-
gether to create integration: (1) what the company or brand Planned
says about itself (say), (2) how the company or brand per- messages
forms (do), (3) and what other people say about it
(confirm). Figure 18.1shows these relationships. The im-
portant principle here is that, since a brand is an integrated
perception, a brand is what people say about it—and that
defines your brand’s reputation. Furthermore integration

is more profitable and builds longer lasting customer relationships than just relying on one tool,
such as advertising.
Ten Principles of IMC
AnAdweekarticle on new marketing principles, urges managers to use what we are calling big
picture thinking: “shifting from campaign thinking to conversation thinking,” what the author
called “Think 365—not 360.”7The point is to become an indispensable part of people’s daily lives
whenever or wherever a customer needs what a brand offers. That ongoing, multichannel, multi-
platform, multistakeholder approach to the practice of IMC is what we have been referring to in
previous chapters when we have described the principles and practices of IMC. We also added
two more in the previous discussion, so we now have a set of ten principles of IMC.
Let’s summarize this total brand communication philosophy by compiling the complete set
of IMC principles that we have developed in this book. The 10 basic principles that we believe
guide IMC practices are shown in Table 18.2. These are a manager’s toolkit to guide the design
of a 360-degree brand communication program.
As we said at the beginning of this chapter, a number of different marketing communication
situations can benefit from an IMC approach. Let’s now consider the practice of our first specialty
area—retail marketing.
Table 18.2 Ten Principles of IMC
First Principle of IMC Everything communicates.
Everything in the marketing mix sends a message. Everything a brand does, and sometimes
what it doesn’t do, can send a message. One cannot NOT communicate. Receiving messages
is as important as sending messages. Integrating the marketing communication is futile if
contrary and more powerful messages are being sent by other brand actions.
Second Principle A brand is a unified vision (the art) and a complex system (the science).
Third Principle Brand relationships drive brand value.
Interactivity leads to brand involvement. When two parties interact, both learn about the other.
Customer retention is just as important as customer acquisition.
Fourth Principle Integration equals integrity.
Mission marketing adds trust to brand relationships.
Fifth Principle People automatically integrate brand messages and experiences.
Synergy occurs when all the messages work together to create a coherent brand perception.
Sixth Principle Stakeholders overlap.
Seventh Principle All contact points deliver brand messages.
Everything that delivers a message to a stakeholder about a brand is a contact point. Both
good and bad. Maximize and leverage the good ones and minimize the bad ones.
Eighth Principle Strategic consistency drives synergy.
At every point of contact with every stakeholder, the essence of the brand should be the same.
Strategic consistency, rather than one-look, one-voice executions, drives synergy.
Ninth Principle You can’t be integrated externally if you are not integrated internally.
A core brand strategy—a shared vision—drives the entire organization. Cross-functional
organization delivers unity of vision, and unity of vision drives an integrated brand perception.
Tenth Principle Integration happens when what your brand says matches what it does and
what others say about it.
A brand fails as an integrated perception if there are gaps between say, do, and confirm brand
communication.

CHAPTER 18 • THE IMC UMBRELLA 551
Asignificant part of the U.S. economy, big
stores such as Walmart, Target, Kohl’s, Sears,
and JCPenney, accounts for more than 10 per-
cent of all U.S. consumer goods spending. Ac-
cording to branding consulting firm Interbrand,
the three most valuable retail brands in the
United States are Walmart with a brand value
estimated at $154 billion. Target is second at
$25.5 billion, and Best Buy is third at $17.8 bil-
lion. Others in the top 10 were Home Depot,
Walgreens, CVS, Sam’s Club, Dell, Coach, and
Amazon.com.8
In some estimates, retail accounts for
nearly half of all the money spent on advertis-
ing. Retail marketing communication has two
missions: (1) selling the brand of the retail store,
as the Saks ad demonstrates, and (2) selling in-
dividual branded items the store carries. Best

everything from Adobe to Yamaha with hun-
dreds of brands in between. Increasingly, retail
food and drug chains are giving more space and promotional support to their own store brands,
also called private-label brandsorhouse brands.
The three basic types of retail stores are those that are independently ownedsuch as a barber
shop, those that are part of a franchisesuch as KFC and Hertz, and those that are owned by a ma-
jorcorporationsuch as Starbucks and Macy’s. Retailers such as Sears, Staples, Home Depot, and
Best Buy advertise nationally and locally. Local advertising is targeted at consumers who live
within a geographical market, what we called a Designated Market Area (DMA) in Chapter 14.

Of course, another popular form is online retailing. More than just retail websites for exist-
ing stores, the iTunes and iApp electronic storefronts have created a new face for retail selling—
not just to people sitting at their computers, but also to those using mobile media wherever they
may be. Technology is changing shopping. Aboutique in Manhattan, for example, offers a new
way to shop using a cell phone—shoppers standing outside a store window, even if the store is
closed, can point the phone at merchandise and buy it.9
Retail Communication Planning
As mentioned previously, retailers sell not only a range of product brands, they also sell themselves
as destinations for buying a selection of products. Apositive, distinctive image is a valuable asset
and especially important for upscale retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue. Retailers who want to build
a brand image, particularly an upscale one, must clearly and consistently communicate that image
to consumers through advertising, other forms of marketing communication, pricing strategies, lo-
cation, and the physical appearance of the store.
Retail Objectives Customers base their decisions about where to shop on the quality of the
shopping experience, as well as on such retail decision factors as choice, selection, and service.
These, in turn, affect retail marcom objectives.
The primary objective is to build store traffic,which marketing communication does by fea-
turing reduced prices on popular items and promoting an appealing store image and shopping ex-
perience. In addition to traffic, most retailers use advertising to help attract new customers, build
store loyalty, increase the amount of the average sale, maintain inventory balance by moving out

overstocks and outdated merchandise, and
counter seasonal lows (see Figure 18.2). An-
other characteristic of retail advertising is an
inherent sense of urgency—“weekend spe-

“while supplies last.” To build loyalty or to

advertising is geography. stores’shopping area (generally a two- to five-mile radius).
The next concern is consumer taste, which may also reflect geography. National retailers try
to develop offers that appeal to consumers in different parts of the country, as well as in different
neighborhoods. H.E.B. Supermarkets operates its stores in both central and south Texas. In San
Antonio, the stores located in Mexican-American neighborhoods have a very different merchan-
dise assortment, as well as different advertising than do its stores in other locations. Sometimes
special sales are used to reach special target audiences as the Virgin “Forever 70s” sale demon-
strates, which has some fun with the type of person who might be interested in 70s music.
Cooperative Advertising
One way local retailers can compensate for their smaller advertising budgets and limited exper-
tise is to take advantage of cooperative (co-op) advertising(Chapters 2, 8, 12, and 17), in which
the national brand reimburses the retailer for part or all of the advertising expenses. Also called
ad allowancesorpromotional allowances,these co-op funds have become so common that most
retailers won’t even consider taking on a new brand, especially one in a heavily advertised cate-
gory, without receiving some support. Large drug and discount chains periodically produce spe-
cial advertising supplements. Their suppliers are offered an opportunity to buy space in these
supplements. The result is that much or all of retail advertising is paid for by the brands carried
in the advertising.
CHAPTER 18 • THE IMC UMBRELLA 553
SHOWCASE
For Virgin Megastore’s “Forever 70s” sale, Chris Hutchinson came up with the idea of a character who was stuck in the 70s—his music,
his style, his lingo, his attitude. Where to find this cool cat? The perfect person turned out to be the art director himself who worked
out a great outfit—a huge Afro, tight bellbottoms, and an orange leather jacket that his father wore in the real 1970s. The
photographer shot on the run to get a semi-documentary look. The client loved the print so the art director directed
himself in a set of TV spots, as well. The sale was a huge success nationwide.
A graduate of the University of Oregon’s advertising program, Chris Hutchinson was nominated for
inclusion in this book by Professor Charles Frazer.
Creating the Retail Ad
Prior to actually writing copy or drawing a layout, creative advertising experts Jeweler and
Drewniany suggest that advertisers answer this question: Why would you shop in your store? Pos-
sible answers to this question can provide direction for the creative process. They suggest these
typical reasons:11
• Store’s personnel
• Store’s location
• Store’s pricing policy
• Store’s products
• Store’s history
• Store’s stand on social responsibility issues.

Because the main object of retail ads is to attract customers, store location (or telephone
number, if advertising is a service) is essential. For merchandise that is infrequently purchased,
such as cars, furniture, wallpaper, and hearing aids, the ad should include a map or mention a
554 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
geographic reference point (for example, three blocks north of the state capitol building) in addi-
tion to the regular street address.
Most retail advertising is created and produced by one or a combination of the following: in-
house staff, local media, ad agencies, and/or freelancers. The larger the retail operation, the more
likely it is to have an in-house advertising staff because few outside agencies are prepared to han-
dle the large number of day-to-day copy changes and the fast deadlines that are typical of major
retail advertising.
In the case of national chains and franchises, the national headquarters provides ad formats,
TVcommercials, and radio spots, all of which can be localized. All local media also are willing
to create and produce ads for retailers as a way to get them to use their media. With the exception
of television stations, most provide this service free.
Local retailers will sometimes use local agencies to create a campaign they can run over
time. If successful, as the Virgin story illustrates, the creative idea may become a national cam-
paign. Generally outside agency work is the most costly way to produce retail ads on a regular
and frequent schedule so agencies are used instead to create image ads or campaigns.

The Media of Retail Marketing Communication
At the national level, retail chains use a variety of traditional and nontraditional media—newspapers,
magazines, television, outdoor, the Internet, guerilla marketing. Manufacturers also provide win-
dow banners, free-standing displays, and special direct-mail pieces, such as four-color supple-
ments for the local paper that carry the store’s name and address. Other media used by retailers
include banners, posters, shelf talkers(signs attached to a shelf that let the consumer take away
some piece of information or a coupon), and other merchandising materials, such as end-of-aisle
displays and shopping cart ads. New interactive electronic kiosks with touch-screen computers,
CD-ROM databases, full graphics, and product photos are moving into the aisles in many stores,
where they provide more information about more products than the store can ever stock on its
shelves.
Unlike national advertisers, local retailers generally prefer reach over frequency since the
majority of their advertising is for special promotions. Because retailers can choose from many
local media, they are careful to use media that minimize waste. That’s why direct mail is now the
second-largest advertising medium used by retailers (newspapers are first).
Newspapers have always made up the bulk of retailer advertising because the local newspa-
per fits the retailer’s desire for geographic coverage and immediacy (although local businesses
are moving some, if not most, of their advertising online and sites like Craig’s List are seriously
cutting in to the classified advertising revenues). Retailers can gain some measure of audience se-
lectivity by advertising in specific sections of the paper, such as sports (for sporting goods stores)
and financial pages (for banks and loan companies), and in zone editions(certain versions of the
paper that go to certain counties and suburbs). Free-distribution newspapers called shoppersare
also popular advertising vehicles for retailers, as are preprints,also called free-standing inserts
(FSIs),which are placed inside newspapers.
Many of the top 50 markets in the United States have at least one local magazine offering
retailers high-quality, four-color ads to reach upscale consumers. Some national magazines have
regional or metropolitan editions that also enable local retailers to buy exposure within their trad-
ing area only.
Nearly all major markets now have at least one local independent station and a public tele-
vision station. The A Matter of Practicefeature explains how television advertising can be used
for revitalizing a retail brand image. Radio is used by local retailers because it has a relatively low
cost, a high degree of geographic and audience selectivity, and flexibility in scheduling.

In 2006 we began taking the brand in a new direction
by building a position on a young, modern, and energetic
platform and gearing the marketing communication cam-
paigns to communicate this message.
The first phase of the campaign was vibrant and atten-
tion grabbing to match the “happening” concept, which set
out to communicate that there is always something exciting
and new going on at SPAR. This campaign was communi-
cated through television, leaflets, news, and radio. Three
main themes, “Jumpin’,” “Shakin’,” and “Bubblin’,” were
used to convey the spirit and image of the brand.
The next phase was an exciting effort to reinforce
and evolve the up-tempo positioning of the SPAR
brand, while still retaining its youth and energy. This
campaign approach was born out of SPAR’s realization
that the brand needed to remain “Forever Young.” This
taps into the global focus on preserving
youth through attitude, products, diet,
and exercise and has emotional appeal to
the consumer of the future, through the
celebration of what life has to offer.
This campaign, known as “Life’s
Great,” required an element of innovative,
creative execution to inspire and motivate
consumers to build a relationship with
SPAR. That element was using one of the
country’s hottest bands, Prime Circle, to
write and perform the song for the TV
campaign.
Our campaign song was released on
the latest Prime Circle album, received air
time on radio, and was played in clubs
around the country. Since the song was
prereleased in the SPAR ad, all future air-
play that the song receives prompted
recognition and recall of the campaign,
entrenching the message that “Life Is
Great” at SPAR.
556 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
The Internet is making a huge difference in business operations. Some retailers are selling
as much online as they do from their stores—a successful clicks-and-bricks strategy. In addition
to online business, retailers have found interesting ways to use the Web for marketing communi-
cation. Some fashion retailers, for example, employ their own bloggers who review the store’s
lines.12
Staying on top of fashion is challenging for trendy retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch,
which really suffered during the recent recession. Even with a high level of sale prices, the re-
tailer’s woes seemed to suggest a more basic problem with its “once unerring sense of style.” An-
alysts said that A&F’s look was stale and the company was no longer in touch with hot trends.13
Retail, particularly in fashion, can be a tricky business.
BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKETING COMMUNICATION
As we explained early in the book, advertising directed at people in business who buy or specify
products for business use is called business-to-business (B2B) advertising.Business marketing
is the marketing of goods and services to other businesses. Although personal selling is the most
common method of communicating with business buyers, business advertising is used to create
corporate brand awareness, enhance the company’s reputation, support salespeople and other
channel members, and generate new business leads. It also reinforces the brand position as the In-
terprint ad illustrates.
B2B Buying Behavior
Businesses buy goods and services for two basic reasons: (1) they need ingredients for the prod-
Principle
ucts they manufacture, and (2) they need goods (such as computers, desks, and chairs) and ser-
B2B buyers are driven by

concerns must be the buying decision is made. Buying decisions are often made by committees on behalf of the
addressed by B2B people who use the products, and the actual purchase is negotiated by a specialist in that category

dise for their different departments.
Purchasing objectives in B2B marketing
center on rational, pragmatic considerations
such as price, service, quality of the good or ser-
vice, and assurance of supply. For that reason,
B2B communication tends to use rational strate-
gies and focus on reasons and benefits.
Types of B2B Marketing
Communication
Businesses are grouped according to the North
American Industry Classification System
(NAICS), which was formerly known as the
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system
(seewww.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html). This
system allows a marketer to determine its cus-

of the final product or aid business operations. Industrial advertisingis directed at OEMs.
For example, when General Motors purchases tires from Goodyear, information needs focus
on whether the purchase will contribute positively to the final vehicle. When Goodyear pur-
chases the packaging materials used to ship the tires it manufactures, information needs fo-
cus on prompt, predictable delivery.
• GovernmentThe largest purchasers of industrial goods in the United States are federal,
state, and local governments. These government units purchase virtually every kind of good,
from $15 hammers to multimillion-dollar missiles. Such goods may be advertised in
Commerce Business DailyorDefense News. These purchases are usually made by bids and
contracts, and the decision is made on price and specifications.
• Trade/Channel MarketingTrade advertisingis used to persuade distribution channel mem-
bers, such as distributors, wholesalers, dealers, and retailers, to stock the manufacturer’s
products.Chain Store Age,Florist’s Review, and Pizza and Pastaare examples of trade pub-
lications, and there are thousands more covering every possible product category. Resellers
want information on the profit margins they can expect to receive, the product’s major sell-
ing points, and the producer’s plans for consumer advertising and other promotional support.
• ProfessionalAdvertising directed at a group of mostly white-collar workers such as lawyers,
accountants, technology consultants, doctors, teachers, funeral directors, and advertising and
marketing specialists is known as profession advertising.Advertisers interested in attract-
ing professionals advertise in publications such as the Music Educators’Journaland
Advertising Age.
• AgriculturalAgricultural advertising promotes a variety of products and services, such as
animal health products, seeds, farm machinery and equipment, crop dusting, and fertilizer.
Large and small farmers alike want to know how industrial products can assist them in the
production of agricultural commodities.
They turn to such publications as
California FarmerandTrees and Turffor
such assistance.

are more effective. Also advertising in trade

lines to create effective ads:

sively.
• Dramatize the most important benefit, either

558 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
• Make sure the visual is relevant to the key message. It should help readers understand how
your product or service works or instantly show that you understand the problem.
• Make the offer as clear as possible. What exactly do you want the reader to do as a result of
seeing your ad?
• Provide contact information. It should be easy for the potential customer to follow through
with a response.
B2B Media
Although some business marketers use traditional consumer media, most rely on general business
or trade publications, industrial directories, consumer media, websites, direct marketing, or some
combination of these media.
• General Business and Trade PublicationsAs we saw in Chapter 12, business and trade
publications are classified as either horizontal or vertical. Horizontal publicationsare di-
rected to people who hold similar jobs in different companies across different industries. For
example,Purchasingis a specialized business publication targeted to people across indus-
tries who are purchasing agents. In contrast, vertical publications,such as Iron Age and
SteelorAdvertising Age, are targeted toward people who hold different positions in a partic-
ular industry.
• Directory AdvertisingEvery state has an industrial directory, and there are also a number of
private ones. One of the most popular industrial directories is the New York–based Thomas
Register. The 19-volume Registercontains 50,000 product headings and listings from
123,000 industrial companies selling everything from heavy machine tools to copper tubing
to orchestra pits.
• Consumer MediaSometimes businesses advertise in consumer magazines, such as Golf,
Time,orNewsweek,in the hope of building widespread brand recognition, such as the “Intel
Inside” campaign. There also has been some growth in business television programming,
which provides a good message vehicle for certain B2B companies. For example, Financial
Network News (FNN) produces its own business shows and carries the syndicated business
showsThis Morning’s BusinessandFirst Business.
• The Internet and B2BThe Internet is a key medium for B2B advertisers. Company web-
sites allow business clients to view product lists, place orders, check prices and availabil-
ity, and replace inventories automatically. The Internet is also a primary research tool used
by B2B marketers to check out competitors and to find areas of new business and suppli-
ers. One of the most popular B2B sites on the Internet is the FedEx site, which allows
clients to track packages, obtain price information, and learn about FedEx software and
services. It receives 1.7 million tracking requests a month, 40 percent of which probably
would have been called in to the company’s 800 number if the website were not available.
Because handling each call costs approximately $1, its website saves FedEx more than $8
million a year.
• B2B Direct MarketingDirect mail has the capacity to sell a B2B brand, provide sales leads,
and lay the groundwork for subsequent sales calls. Business advertisers use print and online
catalogs and product literature to reach their target markets, which support the selling func-
tion by providing technical data about the product and supplementary information concern-
ing price, availability, delivery, and warranties. Direct marketing is widely used because
most target audiences are smaller than the audiences for many consumer brands; therefore,
B2B marketers can target their messages (because they know names and addresses) and
greatly minimize media waste.
Customer service and technical support departments are important in many different busi-
ness categories, but particularly in B2B. Calling a customer help line frequently gets you a mes-
sage about wait time, a robotic recording, an impenetrable non-U.S. accent, or a cheerfully inept
live person. The message: “Your call is (not that) important to us,” which is also the title of a book
critical of customer service industry practices.14One solution to the customer service problem in
computer technical support is to enlist volunteers who are “super-users.” So you think no one
would work for a company for free, right? That’s exactly how a corps of Web-savvy people cre-
ated the open-source Linux operating system. Verizon and other companies have found that there
CHAPTER 18 • THE IMC UMBRELLA 559
are groups of experts who find social (and intellectual) rewards in solving problems and, in some
cases, contributing to product development and improvement.15
Social media have become important to B2B marketers because they offer personal contact,
which is ideal for tightly targeted programs. An IBM social media manager has some ideas for
B2B marketers on how to use Twitter for segmenting prospects in terms of the desired response.
Her point is that within businesses, you may want to contact people in different parts of the or-
ganization with specific messages. Here is a summary of this strategy in terms of public relations
and promotion activities looking at who to follow and the appropriate objectives for reaching that
group. If you were assigned to develop a Twitter strategy for your student center on campus, what

NONPROFIT OR SOCIAL MARKETING
Effective marketing and advertising techniques are not only important for businesses, but also for
nonprofit organizations involved in community issues, public policy, and good causes. Nonprofit
marketing is used by organizations such as hospitals, government agencies, zoos, museums, or-
chestras, religious organizations, charities, and universities and schools to “sell” their services,
programs, and ideas.
Many people make the mistake of thinking that competition only exists between for-profit
companies. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Nonprofits often have to compete as hard, if
not more so, than for-profit companies because they know individuals and businesses have just
so much money and time to donate to nonprofit organizations. It is also a myth to think that non-
profits are not businesses. The Red Cross and the Salvation Army, for example, have hundreds of
full-time paid staff and multimillion-dollar annual budgets.
Nonprofit organizations have a number of goals, such as membership(AARP, chambers of
commerce),donations(Red Cross, United Way, American Cancer Society), participation(Habi-
tat for Humanity), sales (museum gift shops), recruitment (the military, universities), attitude
change (political parties), advocacy (Weyerhauser for forest management), and visits or
attendance(state tourism programs, art museums).
Another goal is action, as the SORPA recycling ads from Iceland demonstrate. Agency

Fund-Raising
One activity that almost all nonprofits do is fund-raising,sometimes called development,often
under the guidance of a development officer who is a professional specializing in fund-raising.
Groups such as Save the Children and the Nature Conservancy use sophisticated segmentation
and message strategies to target audiences and raise funds.

Social Marketing and Public Communication
The use of marketing programs and marketing communication tools to create awareness of a so-
cial need is called social marketing.It is also used to motivate consumers and businesses to act
in certain ways, such as give money, volunteer time, or adopt certain policies. The anti-smoking
and antidrug campaigns are examples of social marketing.
Social marketing is also called public communication. Public communication campaigns
are undertaken by nonprofit organizations as a conscious effort to influence the thoughts or ac-
tions of the public. The biggest and longest running program is the Advertising Council, which is
a network of advertising agencies, media, and suppliers that donate their services to create ads
and campaigns on behalf of socially important causes: crime prevention, child abuse, mental ill-
CHAPTER 18 • THE IMC UMBRELLA 561
ness, and the environment. The “Smoky Bear” fire prevention effort is one of the longest running
and best-known Ad Council campaigns.
Another example comes from Jeremy Boland, art director at Borders Perrin Norrander in
Portland, Oregon, who contributed a campaign that he directed from the 2008 presidential cam-
paign. It’s an example of integrated planning for a public communication effort. You can see the
“Things Are Fine” campaign at www.thingsarefine.org. Boland describes the effort as “a hugely
impactful campaign to get the youth demographic out and vote in this last presidential election.”
Boland said it was “overwhelming how well received on a global level it was” and it has been de-
scribed as “one of the most memorable campaigns from the election.”
Cause and Mission Marketing
An annual study, the Edelman Consumer Study, found that almost 60 percent of the world’s con-
sumers do business with a company because it supports good causes.
Concern for social issues is increasingly important for for-profit companies because they
want to be seen as socially responsible. Pepsi, for example, launched the Pepsi “refresh project”
dedicating at least $20 million in 2010 to nonprofits and causes consumers propose on the cam-
paign’s website (www.refresheverything.com). Visitors can vote on the ideas suggested during the
previous month. Amedia blitz to announce the effort included appearances by Kevin Bacon and
Demi Moore on NBC’s Today Show, ads on other broadcast networks, and messages on AOL,
Facebook, Hulu, MTV, Parade, and Yahoo!.16

Professor Scott Hamula explains that “in addition to operating with a sense of social re-
sponsibility, marketers engage in philanthropy through cause marketing.” The primary goals, he
says, are “to help communities and nonprofit organizations while generating goodwill, positive
word-of-mouth, and the hope that people will look more favorably on these brands when making
their next purchase decision.” He explains how this works in the A Principled Practicefeature.
Asocietal marketingphilosophy describes the operations of companies whose corporate mis-

INTERNATIONAL MARKETING COMMUNICATION
The globalization of marketing communication is driven by the development of international me-
dia, globalization of brands, and the spread of market-based economies in countries and regions
such as China, South America, India, and Eastern Europe. Also, the expanded use of English as an
international language is helping spread Western marketing ideas to the rest of the world. The
564 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
Internet has also had a huge impact on bringing the ability to
market internationally to even the smallest of companies.
Stages of Marketing Development
Virtually every product category can be divided into local, na-
tional, regional (trading bloc), and international markets and
brands. Typically this involves a process that begins when a
national company expands to a few foreign markets by
exportingits products. Then at the second stage it begins to in-
ternationalize its operations by selling to a group of markets in
a region (Europe or Asia, for example) and eventually moves
to a global perspective, the third stage, with brands sold
throughout the world. An example of a company adopting an
international perspective comes from the “World Peace” ad
used by IBM in 1938.
A characteristic of globalized companies is that the
country of origin label often doesn’t apply. Nokia and Mo-
torola, even though they are not U.S. companies, are both fa-
miliar brands to U.S. consumers. Country of origin, however,
can be a problem as McDonald’s found out when its restau-
rants were targeted because it represented America at a time
when the country’s political actions were being criticized
worldwide. McDonald’s has been boycotted in the Philippines
and Argentina, as well as in many Arab countries—not for
anything it does but simply because of its image as an iconic
American brand. Efforts by McDonald’s local franchisees
have included trying to present a local face by using its em-
ployees in traditional dress standing outside the store and by
making contributions to local charities.

IBM used this “World Peace” ad to demonstrate its in the A Matter of Practice feature originated in the Nether-
commitment to world trade and the international marketing lands in 1932 and is now present in 33 countries on four con-
of its products. tinents. The SPAR model is for each store to have its own
personality and range of products, which are adapted to its in-
dividual market.
The Global versus Local Debate
There is an old axiom, “All business is local.” An extension of this saying is “Think globally, act
locally.” Although advertising campaigns can be created for a global market, they must be rele-
vant to a transaction that is completed at or near home or in the office.
Aclassic article by Harvard Business School professor Theodore Levitt as long ago as 1983
ignited a debate over how to conduct global marketing. Levitt argued that companies should op-
erate as if there were only one global market. He suggested that differences among nations and
cultures were not diminishing and people throughout the world are motivated by the same desires
and wants.19 Other scholars argued that Levitt misinterpreted the importance of cultural differ-
ences and cited the success of such brands as Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and McDonald’s in develop-
ing products and marketing for the various cultures they serve.20
In support of Levitt’s thinking, some researchers propose sets of what they call universal val-
uesthat cross cultures. They include such values as these:
1. Protecting the family 6. Justice
2. Honesty 7. Freedom
3. Health and fitness 8. Friendship
4. Self-esteem 9. Knowledge
5. Self-reliance 10. Learning

• StandardizationThestandardizationschool of thought contends that differences between
countries are a matter of degree, so advertisers must instead focus on the similarities of con-
sumers and a consistent brand presentation.
• Localization (Adaptation)Thelocalizationoradaptationschool of thought argues that ad-
vertisers must consider differences among countries, including local culture, stage of eco-
nomic and industrial development, stage of life cycle, media availability, research
availability, and legal restrictions.
• CombinationThis approach reasons that a combination of standardization and localization
may produce the most effective advertising. Some elements of brand identity and strategy,
for example, may be standardized, but advertising executions may need to be adapted to the
local culture.
The reality of global advertising suggests that a combination approach is often best. The Principle
challenge for advertisers is to balance variations nationally or regionally with a basic global brand International marketers

• Standardization ensures that the brand messages of a product are complementary and rein-

• The company maintains control over the image projected by all brand communication for
the brand.
• Global media create opportunities for global marketing.
• Converging buyer wants and needs mean that buyers everywhere will increasingly want the

text, with Japanese being the highest context culture. This model helps explain the diffi-
culties of advertising in other languages.
Advertising messages constructed by writers from high-context cultures might be difficult
to understand in low-context cultures because they may offer too much detail to make the point
clearly. In contrast, messages authored by writers from low-context cultures may be difficult to
understand in high-context cultures because they omit essential contextual detail.
Central Control versus Local Adaptation As noted previously, some marketers develop tightly
controlled global campaigns with minimum adaptation for local markets. Others develop local
campaigns in every major market. Most companies are somewhere in the middle. How are global
campaigns created? International advertising campaigns have two basic starting points: (1) suc-
cess in one country and (2) a centrally conceived strategy. Planning approaches also include vari-
ations on the central campaign and bottom-up creativity:
• Local InitiativeAsuccessful campaign, conceived for national application, is modified for
use in other countries. Wrigley, Marlboro, IBM, Waterman, Seiko, Philips, Ford, and many
other companies have taken successful campaigns from one country and transplanted them
around the world, a practice called search and reapply. When a local campaign is found to
be successful, that campaign is taken to one or two countries that are similar to see how well
the campaign works in these areas. If it is successful, use of the campaign is expanded and
can eventually become the brand’s primary international campaign. What is interesting about
this strategy is that it provides additional motivation for local agencies. While all local agen-
cies want to do a good job to keep their local business, it is a major ego boost—not to men-
tion the additional financial awards—when a local campaign is taken beyond its original
country’s borders.
The Honda CR-Vis an example. As Logason explains, “Because of the effectiveness of
the original campaign—both the insights behind the strategy and the idea of ownership of
the 4(cid:5)4 concept, which was so successful in Iceland—the campaign caught the eye of the
global office, and it has been distributed and showcased globally to dealers in other markets
as an example of strong, clever positioning.”
• Centrally Conceived CampaignsThe second approach, a centrally conceived campaign, was
pioneered by Coca-Cola and is now used increasingly in global strategies. Microsoft uses a
centralized strategy for its Xbox video game system; since it was a new brand, a consistent
CHAPTER 18 • THE IMC UMBRELLA 567
marketing strategy was deemed to be essential. Although the centralization concept is sim-
ple, its application can be difficult. Awork team, task force, or action group (the names
vary) assembles from around the world to present, debate, modify, if necessary, and agree on
a basic strategy as the foundation for the campaign. Cost is a huge factor. If the same pho-
tography and artwork can be used universally, this can save thousands of dollars over each
local variation.
• Variations on Central CampaignsVariations on the centrally conceived campaign also
exist. For example, BBDO’s many local agencies were used to adapt the creative ideas
for all the markets served by DaimlerChrysler (now Chrysler after the company split).
The office that develops the approved campaign would be designated the lead agency
and would develop all the necessary elements of the campaign and prepare a standards
manual for use in other countries. Because photography, artwork, television production,
and color printing are costly, developing these items in one location and then overlaying
new copy or rerecording the voice track in the local language saves money. However, be-
cause some countries, such as Malaysia, require that all campaign materials be locally
produced, this approach gives direction to the message but still allows for local require-
ments to be met.
• Bottom-Up CreativitySometimes a competition may be used to find the best new idea. For
example, to extend McDonald’s “I’m Lovin’It” campaign, McDonald’s global chief market-
ing officer held a contest among McDonald’s ad agencies all over the world. One winner,
which became part of the international pool of ads, came from China, which is developing a
lively creative advertising industry that produces edgy, breakthrough ads for young people.
McDonald’s strategy was not just to do the creative work in the United States but rather to
“Let the best ideas win.”
Planning International Strategies
Assuming that the campaign has been approved centrally, with a local application approach, its
execution must be adapted to suit the local market, and that may involve modifying basic strat-
egy decisions, such as objectives, targeting, and perhaps even positioning.
International Objectives The problem of managing brand consistency is largely responsible for
limiting most international or global marketing objectives to awareness and recall, two effective
yet easily attainable marketing communication measures, although more specific objectives may
be needed in individual markets. For example, a brand may be well known in one market, so its
primary objective, then, is reminder. At the same time it may be newly launched in another coun-
try, so the objectives there are awareness building and trial.
Targeting Issues International marketers need to answer three basic targeting questions: (1) What
countries? (2) What level of market development? (3) Which cultural cohort groups?
• What Countries?This is generally the easiest to answer because it is driven by where the
brand is distributed.
• Market Development LevelCountries, especially developing countries, vary greatly in mar-
ket infrastructure, literacy levels, economic level, and level of media development. Some
countries’standard of living is such that luxury brands, for example, would not find a large
enough segment of the population to cover the cost of setting up distribution and supporting
the brand with marketing communication and a sales force.
• Cultural CohortsAcultural cohort is a segment of customers from multiple countries shar-
ing common characteristics that translate into common wants and needs. New mothers are
an example. Regardless of their nationality, new mothers want their babies to be happy and
healthy. Teenagers are another cohort—teens in Tokyo and New York City may have more in
common than a teen and his father.

Research is often conducted to identify the problems and opportunities facing the
product in each of the international markets to be entered, as the Charmin commercial
illustrates. Particularly important is a good understanding of consumer buying motives
in each market. This is almost impossible to develop without locally based consumer
research. If analysis reveals that consumers’buying behavior and the competitive en-
vironment are the same across international markets, it may be possible to use stan-
dardized positioning throughout.

Setting the Budget All the budgeting techniques discussed in Chapter 7apply in for-
eign markets. When preparing a single plan for multiple markets, many companies use
an objective-task budgeting approach that entails a separate budget for each foreign
market. (Remember that this approach looks at the objectives for each activity and de-
termines the cost of accomplishing each objective.) This technique adds some flexibil-
ity to localize campaigns as needed. However, local practices also may affect the
budget decision. Most notably, the exchange rate from country to country may affect
not only the amount of money spent in a particular market, but also the timing of the
expenditures. The cost of television time in Tokyo is approximately twice what it is on
U.S. networks, and, rather than being sold during an up-front market every spring, Jap-
anese TVtime is wholesaled several times during the year.

masters. Chinese officials banned it because they
consider it insulting to national dignity.
But it’s not just government bans that can trou-
ble ad strategies. Social responsibility is taken seri-
ously in some countries and, with the Internet and
e-mail, consumer concerns can create a huge issue.
For example, an ad by fashion house Dolce & Gab-
bana showed a bare-chested man pinning a glam-
orous woman to the ground while his buddies looked
on. Consumers in Spain, Italy, and the United States
complained that it trivialized violence against
women, and the many e-mail complaints led the
company to drop the ad.
International Media Buying In terms of the media
buy, media are different in every country—not only
different, but also developing and evolving. As a re-
sult, it is absolutely essential that a local agency be
used to handle the media buy. In the early 1990s in
China, for example, there was hardly an advertising
industry or advertising media opportunities. China is
widely recognized as the world’s most fragmented
market. Television, for example, has 95 percent pen-
etration with more than 2,200 channels. Internet use
in China reached 384 million registered users in
2009. That’s only 29 percent of China’s population,
so you can see the incredible growth opportunities
for this medium.26

Organizing for International Marketing Communication
Agencies must develop an organizational structure to manage global brand messages. The orga-
nizational structure depends heavily on whether the client company is following a standardiza-
tion or localization strategy. Some agencies exercise tight control, while others allow more local
570 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
autonomy. All these approaches fall into three groups: tight central international control, central-
ized resources with moderate control, or a match of the client’s organization—if the client is
highly centralized, then the agency account structure will be highly centralized.
The IMC Factor in International Campaign Planning
Integrated marketing communication means that all the messages a consumer receives about a
brand work together to create a coherent brand impression. To do that on a global level requires
both horizontal and vertical coordination. The vertical effort represents the coordination of the
key planning decisions, such as targeting, positioning, objectives, strategies, and tactics across all
the various tools used in the communication program. The horizontal level requires coordination
across all countries and regions involved in the plan.
Because of this complexity, it takes a dedicated manager to ensure that all the various mar-
keting communication activities stay consistent to the brand and campaign strategy. The Inside
Storyexplains how an account director at Dentsu, the world’s largest single agency, approaches
integration on behalf of his clients.

Looking Ahead
This chapter started with IMC and then reviewed a number of specialized marketing areas: retail,
B2B, nonprofit, and international. In most of these specialized areas an important strategy for
marketing communicators is to drive consistency through all their messages and brand experi-
ences. It’s cost effective as well as more effective communication. The next chapter will wrap up
this marketing communication journey with a discussion of evaluation—the last and most im-
portant step in proving the effectiveness of IMC programs and campaigns.

IT’S A WRAP
Driving Honda’s CR-V
to Number One
According to Ingvi Logason, owner of the H:N agency in Iceland, the results of his agency’s campaigns over
several years for the Honda CR-V campaign were phenomenal. You may remember that the goal was to
increase the sales of an international auto brand, the Honda CR-V, in Iceland. It also was designed as an inte-
grated campaign. Here is how Logason explains the encore campaign’s success: “In a market where compet-
itive SUVs were being heavily subsidized, we sold all cars with close to no discounts (3 to 5 percent off list
price is standard in Iceland), which demonstrated the brand’s strength.”
His proof: Interest among intended new buyers measured 33 percent (3 percentage points above our aim
of 20 percent increase), top-of-mind scores placed the brand at 3 (1 higher than our goal). The average age
of the new CR-V buyer was 43 years of age (exceeding our target by 2 years) and this led to a 15 percent mar-
ket share in the small SUV section, 25 percent over the target, and the largest in the car market by far. Fur-
thermore the campaign made the new CR-V the fourth most sold car in the country—the best-selling Honda
ever in Iceland.
Not only was the CR-V the best-selling Honda, the campaign drove the CR-V to become the best-selling
small SUV to achieve the position of category leader—outselling the closest competitor 4 to 3. Today Honda
in Iceland has by far the highest market share of all Honda dealerships in Europe.
Logason concludes, “All in all it was a textbook campaign of strategic planning where creative insight de-
rived from research yielded great results. We challenged the target group and created a visual image in their
mind of them owning the car. It was done in a simple, yet meaningful way that built a bridge between a brand
and buyer.“

The Colorado Pass—The Coolest Club
on the Slopes!*
Here’s the problem: How do you not only maintain share of market but in-
crease business for a ski resort in a competitive landscape? I work for Vail
Resorts and that’s one of our biggest challenges.
Although the business from the destination market is important to the finan-
cial health of the company, so are season passes. Season-pass sales are a signifi-
cant contributor to the bottom line and provide revenue stability by locking in
revenue early in the ski season. Lift ticket revenue is 35 percent of all company rev-
enue; season passes represent approximately 33 percent of that lift ticket revenue.
In fact, most season passes are purchased before the season even begins. How-
ever, season-pass purchases are conducted in a very competitive environment be-
cause our resorts go up against other Colorado resorts to secure the largest share
of the 5 million skiers in the local market.
Our company is in a unique position to attract skiers and snowboarders be-
cause of its five mountains—Vail, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge, Keystone, Heavenly-
Lake Tahoe—and Arapahoe Basin (a partner resort). Our largest competitors in
Colorado, where competition is the fiercest, include Copper Mountain, Winter Park,
Aspen, and Steamboat Springs. The company offers a few different types of season
passes, but we’ll focus on the Colorado Pass™, our marquee pass.
One of our strengths is our robust customer databases, which contain trans-
actional information (a history of products purchased) and traditional marketing in-
formation. The combination of the two permits very strong database segmentation
for e-mail and direct-mail efforts. We also track revenue generated from those ef-
forts so that we can assess their ROIs and strengthen the next campaign. We can
also tell if a guest has booked a trip or purchased a product through our e-mails or
direct mail and can ensure that they aren’t served up the same message again—
keeping our communication effective and meaningful.
Vail Resorts has more than 500,000 total e-mail subscribers for various pro-
grams; more than 70,000 of these are Colorado Pass holders. In accordance with
*This chapter opening story was contributed by Jennifer Wolfe-Kimbell, Senior Marketing Manager at Vail Resorts,

the “canned spam” laws, everyone on the list has opted in and asked for e-mail
promotions and information. This is a perfectly qualified database of customers—
they own our product and raised their hands for more information.
As we headed into the selling season for 2009–2010 season passes, the mar-
keting department was charged with ensuring that (1) our loyal pass holders stayed
loyal and renewed—locking them in for the season, (2) previous pass holders re-
turned, and (3) individuals with competitor passes converted to the Colorado Pass.
Once we had secured a healthy base of season-pass holders we had to focus
on generating revenue for the various lines of business within the company (lodg-
ing, ski school, rentals, dining). The challenge for us was that it had been a partic-
ularly difficult landscape. The recession was in full swing and we had to contend
with cautious consumers, elevated gas prices (something the drive market was sen-
sitive to), and a relatively low snow season (this group lives for snow days).
Beyond encouraging our pass holders to renew their passes, what could we do
to take advantage of that pass holder database?
The concept of the Colorado Pass Club (CPC) was introduced as the
2006–2007 ski season wound down. The objectives for the CPC were to distance
the Colorado Pass from competitive passes by offering elevated benefits. In par-
ticular, we wanted to create a sense of community among Colorado Pass holders.
Moving forward, we wanted to continue to drive awareness of the inclusive and ex-
clusive aspects of the pass program.
To further the sense of community and ownership within our pass holder group
we developed the tagline “It’s Why I Live Here.” This tagline strategically positions
our resorts and having a pass with other iconic Colorado experiences. Skiing, and
being outdoors, is an integral part of living in Colorado. We felt that this statement
spoke to a broad market, tapped into sense of pride and exclusivity about living in
Colorado, and complemented the CPC efforts well.
Our CPC program included biweekly e-mails full of promotions, offers, and dis-
counts exclusively for pass holders. Promotions ranged from dining and event tick-
ets to deeply discounted lodging, ski tune-ups, and discounts on gear. We also
gave away tickets to sporting events, free mountain lunches, gas cards, and tickets
to music events. Called “Random Acts of Pass Holder Kindness,” these offers were
diverse enough to create a strong response and a lot of interest and to elevate the
perceived value of the season pass.
Many of our efforts were also supported by radio spots and a special CPC web-
site that recapped the contents of our biweekly e-mails. Slowly these e-mails
started creating buzz in the pass holder community, and soon they were being for-
warded to friends and family.
Not only did the CPC e-mails generate interest and excitement with Colorado
Pass holders, they generated trackable revenue—everything from lodging pur-
chases to ski school lessons, to equipment rentals and, of course, season pass re-
newals. In fact, our e-mail programs were one of the strongest performing channels
for our promotions!
We decided to leverage the passion around our season passes and launched a
referral program, rewarding skiers for referring their friends to buy a pass—furthering
our intent of building a community. We were able to test various versions of e-mails—
we learned that simpler was better and started to reframe offers by coming up with
a few high-impact offers rather than several small gestures.
As the program continues to evolve, we have learned quite a bit about our
pass holders and have begun to not only offer them great benefits and expressions
CHAPTER 19 • EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS 579
of appreciation, we engage them in a dialogue and use this group for surveys
about product attributes and program improvements.
We also designed unique ways to engage them with content by running con-
tests asking why they haven’t skied more. When our pass holders responded with
stories about job loss, bad equipment, the need for improved ski technique, we re-
sponded by finding one pass holder a job, giving gift certificates to replace equip-
ment, and signing them up for free ski school! The pass holder community loved it.
The result cemented the Colorado Pass Club as the most important club for
Colorado skiers. You can find out more about what we achieved by turning to the
end of the chapter and reading It’s a Wrap.
Throughout this book you’ve read about the effectiveness of
advertising. We’ve emphasized that effective campaigns do
more than win awards for creativity. They work hard to achieve
the campaign’s communication and marketing goals, as does
the Colorado Pass Club campaign for Vail. As you will see in
this chapter, there are many ways to evaluate the effectiveness
of various aspects of an advertising and marketing communi-
cation program. Specifically, four categories of work get eval-
uated in advertising and marketing communication programs:
the message execution, the media, the campaign, and the other
marketing communication areas and their synergistic effect as
part of an IMC program. This chapter discusses the basic con-
cept of the evaluation of effectiveness and then examines those
four areas.
IMPACT: DOES IT WORK?
What makes a marcom message effective? The fact that people
like it—or the fact that it moves people to some kind of action?
The classic campaign for Avis is an example of one that works
on both levels—people like it and it drove the company to
record sales levels. When advertising works—when marketing
communication is effective—it has impact and generates a re-
sponse of some kind from its target audience. The critical
phrase—“as intended”—means there are multiple objectives
and, therefore, multiple ways to evaluate the effectiveness of

Association Behavior Evaluating Effectiveness
The most important principle in this chapter—
possibly in this book—is a well-known maxim:
“If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.”
Some evaluation is informal and based on
the judgment of an experienced manager. There
is always a need for the intuitive analysis of ex-
FIGURE 19.1 perienced professionals. The important thing,
The Facets of Effects Model however, is to recognize early in the planning stage the need for a formal evaluation mecha-
nism, as Professor Mark Stuhlfaut explains. Evaluation should be “planned in” to any cam-
paign. Evaluation determines the success of a marketing communication, but it also feeds back
into the ongoing brand communication plan. Figure 19.2illustrates that process, and Professor
Stuhlfaut’s A Matter of Principle features builds on the idea of a cycle beginning and ending
Principle with research.
If you can’t measure it, In addition to intuition and judgment, measurement that tracks consumer response is also

calls. Often, however, the evaluation effort involves a more formal research project, which also
needs to be part of the campaign planning.
Personal insights into what makes an ad great are important, but why do we also need for-
mal evaluation? The first reason is that the stakes in making an advertising misstep are high. By
the time an average 30-second commercial is ready for national television, it has cost about
$200,000 in production costs. If it is run nationally, its sponsor can invest several million dollars
in airtime. The second reason is advertising optimization, or reducing risk by testing, analyzing,
tracking brand performance, and making changes where possible to increase the effectiveness of
the advertising. The third reason is to learn what works and what doesn’t—in other words, to iden-
tify best practices so a brand’s advertising continues to improve.
Types and Stages of Evaluation
Evaluation is done through testing, monitoring, and measurement. Testing is used to predict
results, monitoring tracks performance, and measurement evaluates results. In other words,
for major campaigns a sample of the ads is typically tested before they run as a way to predict
effectiveness. Ideally, the results of preliminary evaluative research should be available before
large sums of money are invested in finished work or in media buys.
As a campaign unfolds, the performance is tracked to see whether any elements need to be
changed. Sales may fall, or they may not increase as rapidly as expected. Is the advertising at

termine its impact. Furthermore, advertising effects
tend to be delayed, so it’s difficult to link the advertis-
ing seen at one time to a purchase made days or weeks later. Exceptions are direct-response adver-
tising and ads carrying promotional offers good for only a limited time.
Usually advertising is measured in terms of its communication effects—the mental re-
sponses to a message, which become surrogate measuresfor sales impact. Such factors as aware-
ness of the advertising, purchase intention, preference, and liking all suggest that the advertising
message can make a positive contribution to an eventual purchase decision. According to research
professionals at Ipsos ASI, one of the largest U.S. providers of advertising pretesting, “Ads work
best when they engage viewers’interest, when consumers enjoy watching them, when they are
relevant, and when they tell their story in a unique and interesting way.”4Those are some of the
dimensions of effectiveness, but others also are important, as we know from our discussion of
how advertising works in Chapter 4.
On the other hand, some ads don’t work, and it is just as important to understand why that
happens. Some confuse the audience or fail to get attention or connect with consumers. In many
cases, people can’t remember the brand. In some cases, the ad can even boomerang, an effect men-
tioned in a feature on antidrug ads in Chapter 4. The same problem was noted with anti-smoking

The Vail Resorts’Colorado Pass Club launch is an example of how a model of effects can
be developed for a specific campaign and used to drive not only the planning of the effort, but
also the evaluation of its effectiveness. One of the goals to a successful ski season, according
to Vail’s Jennifer Wolfe-Kimbell, is to lock in revenue as early as possible. This can happen in
multiple ways. For Colorado ski resorts, two groups of skiers bring in the bucks: in-state sea-
son pass holders and out-of-state visitors or “destination skiers.” In-state skiers purchase sea-
son passes prior to the ski season and provide a surge of revenue going into the season.
Destination skiers provide incremental revenue throughout the season by booking vacations
and purchasing the lion’s share of daily lift tickets, lodging and dining sales, ski school lessons,
and rentals.
WHAT IS MESSAGE EVALUATION?
Copytesting is a general term that describes various kinds of research used at different stages in
the advertising development process—before, during, and after an ad or campaign has run. Be-
fore we talk about specific types of studies, consider first the various copytesting services and the
factors they feel are important to evaluate.

Copytesting
Copytesting companies have different specialties that focus on different effectiveness dimensions.
The most successful of these companies have conducted enough tests that they have developed
normsfor common product categories. In other words, after they pretest an ad, they can compare
its score with scores from comparable ads. Norms allow the advertiser to tell whether a particular
advertisement is above or below the average for the brand or its product category. Without norms
the advertiser would not know whether a score of 23, for example, is good or bad.
Most of these companies have also developed diagnostic methods that identify strong and
weak points of the ad. Here is a list of some of the more prominent companies and the types of
tests they provide:
• Ameritest:brand linkage, attention, motivation, communication, flow of attention and emo-
tion through the commercial
• COMSCORE ARSgroup:persuasion, brand/ad recall, communication
• Ipsos ASI:recall, attention, brand linkage, persuasion (brand switch, purchase probability),
communication
• Mapes&Ross:brandpreferencechange,ad/brandrecall,ideacommunication,keymes-
sagedelivery,like/dislike,believability,comprehension,desiretotakeaction,attribute

• Millward Brown:branding, enjoyment, involvement, understanding, ad flow, brand integra-
tion, feelings about ad, main stand-out idea, likes/dislikes, impressions, persuasion, new
news, believability, relevance
• RoperASW:overall reaction, strengths and weaknesses, understanding, clutter busting, at-
tention, main message, relevance, appeal, persuasiveness, motivate trial, purchase intent.
Now let’s consider how the services of such companies and the research they conduct can
be used at various points in the development and evaluation of a marketing communication ef-
fort. This outline is based on the Facets Model of Effects that we first introduced in Chapter 4.
Message Development Research
Deciding what facts to convey in marketing communication is never easy. Research is needed to
develop and test alternative message strategies. Planners conduct research with members of the
target audience to develop the message strategy and test the relative effectiveness of various sell-
ing premises—hard sell or soft sell, informational or emotional, and so forth. Insights into con-
sumer motivations and purchasing decisions help solve the often-difficult puzzle of selecting the
most relevant information and motivating promise as well as the emotional appeal that best en-
gages the audience.
Concept Testing Advertising and other marketing communication messages usually incorpo-
rate a Big Idea, a creative concept that is attention getting and memorable. Research in concept
testing compares the effectiveness of various message strategies and their creative ideas. This
testing often relies on a key concept card, which is an artist’s drawing of the visual idea with a
sentence underneath that captures the essence of the idea. Aresearcher may use a pack of three,
five, or more idea cards or rough layouts to elicit consumer responses in a mall or through dis-
cussions in a focus group.
An example of effective concept testing that was used in a campaign’s development is
Volvo’s GLBTcampaign, which was the first campaign of its kind to receive an Advertising Re-
search Foundation (ARF) David Ogilvy award. Witeck-Combs Communications in collaboration
with Prime Access, Inc., developed a set of concepts and rough ad executions representing a range
of GLBT-specific imagery and copy. Ford and Volvo managers selected their top three choices
from the group of proposed ad ideas. The messages were tested to assess the constructs of brand-
ing, communication, and persuasion, including the concept of consumer connection, or whether
the ad makes consumers feel closer to the brand. These constructs were measured in four ways—
cognitive, behavior, emotional, and aspirational dimensions.
Pretesting Another type of evaluative research, called pretesting,helps marketers make final
go/no-go decisions about finished or nearly finished ads. Pretesting differs from concept testing
CHAPTER 19 • EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS 585
or message strategy research, which reveals the strengths and weaknesses of different versions of
a concept or approach as marketers develop them. Pretesting assesses the strength of the finished
message and predicts how well it will perform.
In terms of print advertisements, the ideas to be tested are often full mockups of the ad. In
television, advertisers can test the commercials as storyboard ideas or photoboards(still photos
arranged as a storyboard), but more often commercials are in the form of animatics(drawings or
still photos shot on videotape synchronized with a rough version of the audio track). Advertisers
can show these versions of the commercial to individuals, to focus groups, or in a theater testing
situation. They follow the viewing of the advertisement with a survey, a more open-ended inter-
view, or a set of questions for a group discussion.
Diagnostics Many advertisers and agencies are moving away from copytesting methods that Principle
rely on single scores to evaluate an ad and turning to methods that are more focused on diag- Advertising effects are too

designed to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of their advertising ideas to improve the
work while it is still in development or to learn more from the ad to improve subsequent
advertisements.

During Execution: Concurrent Testing
Concurrent testing takes place while the advertising is running. There are three primary tech-
niques: coincidental surveys, attitude tests, and tracking studies. The first two assess communi-
cation responses; tracking studies evaluate actual behavior.
Thecoincidental surveytechnique is most often used with broadcast media. Random calls
are made to individuals in the target market. By discovering what stations or shows people are
tuned to, the researcher can determine whether the target audience has seen/heard the ad and, if
so, what information or meaning the audience members now have of the brand. This technique
can be useful in identifying basic problems. For example, several years ago Pepsi discovered that
the use of Madonna as a spokesperson was a terrible mistake.

also measure unaided and aided awareness of an ad and trial and repeat purchases. They some-
times ask the same questions of competing brands.
Tracking studies show how a marketer’s brand is performing over time, especially after
changes are made in the marketing communication. Because several different measures are taken,
findings can indicate if there is an attention-getting problem, a recall problem (saw message but
can’t remember what it said), a trial problem (remembered the advertising but not moved to try
the brand), or a repeat problem (tried the brand but have not repurchased for some reason).
Brand tracking is an approach that tracks the performance of the brand rather than or in ad-
dition to the advertising. The assumption is that with fragmented media and an abundance of
high-quality but similar products, it is more important to track the brand because it reflects the
quality of the customer’s brand relationship. That’s at the heart of the Colorado Pass Club cam-
paign. Instead of focusing on attributes and claims about a product, this research identifies how
customers are involved with the brand and whether they are more favorably disposed toward it
than toward other brands. As Peppers and Rogers point out, you also need a centralized customer
database that allows you to track customer activity across channels.7
This analysis as depicted in Figure 19.3is also based on the factors identified in the Facets
Model of Effects.

Connect Identification with Brand
Brand tracking studies generally use sets of brand-related questions, but Bain & Company,
a highly respected consulting firm, is promoting the use of a single-question test to track attitudes
to a brand. Called net promoter, it tracks the response to a simple question: “How likely is it that
you would recommend us to a friend or colleague?”8Another single measure is brand penetra-
tion,which is the number of customers who purchase the brand relative to the total population in
the market.9

• Consumer DiariesSometimes advertisers ask a group of representative consumers to keep a
diary during a campaign. The consumers record activities such as brands purchased, brands
used for various activities, brand switches, media usage, exposure to competitive promotions,
588 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
and use of coupons. The advertiser can then review these consumer diariesand determine fac-
tors such as whether the message is reaching the right target audience and whether the audience
is responding to the message as intended. One common unfavorable finding from consumer
diaries is that no attitude or behavioral change occurred because of exposure to the campaign.
• Pantry ChecksThepantry checkprovides much of the same information as the diary
method but requires little from the consumer. Aresearcher goes to homes in the target mar-
ket and asks what brands or products they have purchased or used recently. In one variation
of this procedure, the researcher counts the products or brands currently stocked by the con-
sumer. The consumer may also be asked to keep empty packages, which the researcher then
collects and tallies.
Test Markets Atest marketmight serve to evaluate product variations, as well as elements of
a campaign or a media mix. These are generally conducted in two or more markets with the same
number of similar markets chosen to act as controls. In the control markets the researcher can ei-
ther (1) run no advertising or (2) continue to run the old ad. The new advertising (or product vari-
ation) is used in the test cities. Before, during, and after running the advertising, marketers
compare sales results in the test cities. Some cities, such as Buffalo, Indianapolis, and San Anto-
nio, are considered excellent test markets because their demographic and socioeconomic profiles
are representative of either the United States or a particular target market. Furthermore, they are
relatively isolated as media markets so the advertising impact is less likely to be affected by what
is happening in other markets.
The possibilities for isolating variables in test markets are almost limitless. Researchers can
increase the frequency of advertising or try a different media schedule, for example. They can see
whether an ad emphasizing brand convenience will stimulate sales to two-career families. They
can try an ad that plays up the brand’s fiber or vitamin content or compare the effectiveness of a
two-for-one promotion versus a cents-off coupon.
Post-Testing: After-Execution Research
Another evaluation method is post-testing, which occurs after the marketing communication
hasbeenusedtodetermineifitmetitsobjectives.Themostcommonevaluativeresearchtech-
niques account planners and advertising researchers use include memory tests, persuasion
tests, direct-response counts, frame-by-frame tests, in-market tests such as test markets, and
brandtracking.
Some of these more traditional post-testing methodologies were discussed in Chapter 6,
however, there is another type called heuristicsthat is relevant for certain types of post-testing
evaluation. Harley Manning, vice president for customer experience at Forrester Research, de-
scribes heuristics as a type of expert review that Forrester uses to evaluate the performance of
websites in terms of brand attributes (information provided) and user descriptions and goals as
measured against “a valid set of rules (heuristics) that identify known types of user experience
flaws.” Manning explains that Forrester uses that type of expert-review research to gauge how
well the sites served consumers (keep the brand promise).
The idea is that advertising—and other types of marketing communication messages—vary
in the way they affect people, so the measurements also must be different.
Breakthrough: Attention Most advertising is evaluated in terms of its ability to get and keep
attention. This is a simple concept but difficult to measure. Similar to pretesting, some re-
searchers use instantaneous tracking in a theater setting where viewers with a keypad indicate
what they watch and don’t watch—or rather what interests them and doesn’t interest them. The
Ameritest methodology asks respondents who have just watched a collection of ads to indicate
which ones interested them.10Another firm’s method asks viewers to rate how enjoyable the ad
is, which confounds the attention score with a liking response. Other methodologies use noted
scores for print ads or ask viewers to recognize the concept of a commercial and attach it to a
brand.
Engagement Tests Interest in a commercial is determined by concentration and excitement. Eye-
trackingresearch is a mechanical technique that traces saccadic eye movement,the path the eye

takes in scanning an ad. Because scanning involves a lot of
stops and starts and revisits, this complex map of how a vi-
sual is scanned identifies what first caught the viewer’s at-
tention—the visual point of entry—and where it moved to
next. It also records those elements the eye kept revisiting
either to focus on because they were appealing visuals or
because they needed more study. It also shows what ele-
ments didn’t get noticed at all. The e-Motion system from
the New Jersey–based firm PreTesting Group identifies
eye fixations but also the amount of vibrations in the
retina. The vibration is very minute, but it does indicate a
level of excitement—the more the retina vibrates, the
more interested the viewer.11
Understanding and Comprehension Tests These tests
are used as part of the diagnostic effort, but it is particu-
larly important in post-testing to determine if consumers A beautifully done image for John West, a British beer, uses

it can also be a risky strategy, one that benefits from test-
ing. An example is a billboard for a British beer brand
John West, which is given a dramatic touch by making the rings on top of the can look like rings
of rippling water cast from a fishing bobber.
Memory Tests Memory tests are based on the assumption that an advertisement leaves a men-
tal residue with the person who has been exposed to it; in other words, the audience has learned
something. One way to measure an advertisement’s effectiveness, then, is to contact consumers
who saw the ad and find out what they remember. Memory tests fall into two major groups: recog-
nition tests and recall tests.
One way to measure memory is to show the advertisement to people and ask them whether
they remember having seen it before. This kind of test is called a recognition test. In a recall test,
respondents who have read the magazine are asked to report what they remember from the ad
about the brand. In aided recall tests, the interviewer may go through a deck of cards containing
brand names. If the respondent says, “Yes, I remember seeing an advertisement for that brand,”
the interviewer asks the interviewees to describe everything they can remember about the ad. Ob-
viously recall is a more rigorous test than a recognition test.
Similarly, a TVcommercial is run on network television within a regular prime-time pro-
gram. The next evening, interviewers make thousands of random phone calls until they have
contacted about 200 people who were watching the program at the exact time the commercial ap-
peared. The interviewer then asks a series of questions, such as the following:
• Do you remember seeing a commercial for any charcoal briquettes?
• If NoDo you remember seeing a commercial for Kingsford Charcoal briquettes? (memory
prompt)
• If Yes to Either of the AboveWhat did the commercial say about the product? What did the
commercial show? What did the commercial look like? What ideas were brought out?
The first type of question is called an unaided recallquestion because the particular brand
is not mentioned. The second question is an example of aided recall, in which the specific brand
name is mentioned. The answers to the third set of questions are written down verbatim. The test
requires that the respondent link a specific brand name, or at least a specific product category, to
a specific commercial.
Brand Linkage Tests Testing for brand linkage is basically a test of memorability, however,
the important aspect of this measure is not whether the message is remembered, but whether it
590 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION
associates the brand with the memory. If the commercial fails to estab-
lish a tight connection between the brand name and the selling message,
the commercial will not get a high recall score. This is also called a test
of “brand linkage.” The long-running Pacific Life campaign with its im-
age of a leaping humpback whale is a good example of a visual that
serves as a strong brand reminder and associates the brand with strength
and performance.
Emotion Tests Advertising is just beginning to move into this area of re-
search. There are several ways to get at the emotional response. Ameritest
uses photo sorts with still frames from commercials to identify the posi-
tive and negative moments that touch people’s emotions.12 Other re-
searchers are wiring up viewers of television ads to monitor brain activity
using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine. The
fMRI images identified ads from the 2007 Super Bowl that produced anx-
iety, fear, anger, and insecurity, as well as positive feelings.13
Likability Tests A study by the Advertising Research Foundation
(ARF) compared a variety of different copytesting methods to see if any
of them were better able to predict sales impact. Surprisingly, it wasn’t
awareness, recall, communication, or persuasion measures that won out
but rather likability tests.Likability, however, is not easy to measure be-
cause it’s difficult to know if the consumer likes the ad, the brand, or some
other factor, such as the person giving the test. Anumber of the copytest-
ing companies offer a likability score, but they suggest it needs to be in-

enjoyable, entertaining, and fun.
Persuasion Tests Another evaluative research technique is a persuasion test,or attitude change
test. The basic format is to ask consumers how likely they are to buy a specific brand. Next they
are exposed to an advertisement for that brand, usually as part of a collection of brands. After ex-
posure, researchers again ask them what they intend to purchase. The researcher analyzes the re-
sults to determine whether intention to buy has increased as a result of exposure to the
advertisement. This test is sometimes referred to as an intend-to-buyormotivation test.The va-
lidity of a persuasion test depends in part on whether participants in the experiment represent a
good sample of the prospects the advertiser is trying to reach. Adog food advertiser, for exam-
ple, would not be interested in responses from people who do not own dogs.
Inquiry Tests Aform of action response, inquiry testsmeasure the number of responses to an
advertisement. The response can be a call to a toll-free number, an e-mail or website visit, a
coupon return, a visit to a dealer, an entry in a contest, or a call to a salesperson. Inquiry tests are
the primary measurement tool for direct-response communication, but they also are used to eval-
uate advertisements and sales promotions when the inquiry is built into the message design. In-
quiry tests also are used to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative advertisements using a
split-run technique in magazines, where there are two versions of the magazine printed, one with
ad Aand the other with ad B. The ad (or direct-mail piece) that pulls the most responses is deemed
to be the most effective.

CHAPTER 19 • EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS 591
Scanner research is also used to see what type of
sales spikes are created when certain ads and promotions
are used in a given market. Both the chain and the manu-
facturers of the brands are interested in this data. The re-
gional Safeway system may decide to establish a
consumer panel so it can track sales among various con-
sumer groups. In scanner research,you would be asked
to join a panel, which might contain hundreds of other
customers. You would complete a fairly extensive ques-
tionnaire and be assigned an ID number. You might re-
ceive a premium or a discount on purchases for your
participation. Each time you make a purchase, you also
submit your ID number. Therefore, if Safeway runs a
two-page newspaper ad, it can track actual sales to deter-
mine to what extent the ad worked. Various manufactur-
ers who sell products to Safeway can do the same kind of Scanner research reads the information from a shopper’s

Syracuse University Professor John Philip Jones, who spent many years at J. Walter Thomp-
son (JWT), has used single-source data from JWTcombined with Nielsen TVviewing data to
prove that advertising can cause an immediate impact on sales. His research has found that the
strongest campaigns can triple sales, while the weakest campaigns can actually cause sales to fall
by more than 50 percent.14
Although fairly expensive, single-source research can produce dependable results. Adver-
tisements are received under natural conditions in the home, and the resulting purchases are ac-
tual purchases made by consumers. One drawback, besides cost, is the three to six months
required to set up and run this test. Critics also say that single-source research is better for short-
term immediate sales effects and doesn’t capture very well other brand-building effects.

A classic case of the power of media, particularly the repetition of commercials, is the
“Please Don’t Squeeze the Charmin” campaign that began in 1964. Because it dominated the
airwaves for 20 years, it was hugely visible and built incredible brand awareness—awareness
that led Charmin to dominate its category. It and its brand character, the comical grocer Mr.

Evaluating Audience Exposure
For major campaigns, agencies do post-buy analyses, which involve checking the media plan
against the performance of each media vehicle. The critical question is whether the reach and fre-
quency objectives were obtained.
Verifying the audience measurement estimates is a challenge. Media planners are working
sometimeswithmillionsofdollars,andtheycan’taffordtogetitwrong.Wediscussedhowvari-

Media planning oversight is usually handled in-house by the media buyer, but it can also be
contracted by the advertiser to independent companies who specialize in conducting media au-
dits of the agency’s media planning and buying operations. Nissan and Procter & Gamble are ex-
amples of companies that have hired outside media-auditing firms to confirm the execution of
their media plans.
As the job gets more complex, media planners are being asked to prove the wisdom of their
recommendations in an area where the data they use are sometimes suspect or unreliable, partic-
ularly if there are problems with the media measurement companies’formulas and reporting sys-
tems. Nielsen, for example, has been subject to much criticism for its television ratings.

To better understand the problems in media evaluation, let’s look at two areas where media
performance is hard to estimate: out-of-home media and new media, including the Internet.
Out-of-Home Media As you would expect, accurately measuring the mobile audience for out-
door advertising is challenging. Traffic counts can be gathered, but the problem is that traffic does
not equal exposure. Just because a car drives by a board doesn’t mean that the driver and/or pas-
sengers see it, particularly since some outdoor boards are more attention getting than others, as
the “road rage” board illustrates.
New Media Similarly, the measures of effectiveness used to evaluate offline campaigns don’t
seem to transfer well to the online world. Is the website visitor or banner ad viewer similar to a
member of the print or broadcast audience? The online industry hasn’t been able to establish on-
line equivalencies for GRPs and CPMs and is
still trying to define what makes an effective In-
ternet ad and to develop a system that accurately
measures online effectiveness. At the heart of the
problem is the question of what exactly is to be
measured and how that equates to other media:
readers, viewers, visitors, hits, click-throughs, or
minutes spent with a site? Web-analytic firms
are developing more sophisticated tracking pro-
grams to measure user activity in terms of Web
pages visited, time spent, and click-throughs.
Alternative media, such as word of mouth,
social media, and guerilla marketing campaigns,
are even harder to measure and media planners

because of its interesting visual but also because of its challenging

sured media. Research company Millward Brown has designed a metric for online word of mouth
(WoM) to track and analyze sentiments expressed on social networks, blogs, and chat rooms.16
Procter & Gamble has created TREMOR, which develops buzz campaigns, but is also used to de-
sign analysis techniques to track measurable business results for WoM campaigns.
AnexampleofusingnewmediaanalyticaltoolstoassessperformancecomesfromtheTaco
Bell “Drive-Thru Diet” campaign, which promoted the fast-food chain’s “Fresco” menu. Al-
though the campaign wasn’t presented as a weight-loss program, it generated a significant

blogs,messageboards,andsocialmedia,TacoBell’sbuzzratingdroppedsixpoints—thevolume
of postings increased but the tone was much more negative, which indicated the strategy was
backfiring.17
Another interesting experiment was conducted by Boston University college students and
the Mullen ad agency using Twitter to get near-instantaneous feedback on how viewers were re-
acting to Super Bowl ads. The project was designed “to use a new medium to comment on an old
medium,” according to Mullen’s chief creative officer.18
ROI and Media Efficiency
Advertisers continue to improve how they measure advertising ROI(return on investment, which
means the costs of creating and running the advertisement versus the revenue it generates). An-
other way to look at it is the cost-to-sales ratio.
Since the dollar impact for advertising—and public relations, especially—is difficult to mea-
sure, ROI is hard to calculate. The campaigns must be carefully designed not only to increase
sales, but also to ensure that advertisers can isolate the impact of the message and verify that the
advertising caused the increase in sales. ROI is easier to calculate for direct marketing (because
there are fewer variables between the message and the sales) and for sales promotion (because
there is an immediate response, which is easier to link to the message).
One question related to ROI is this: How much spending is too much? That is, how do you
determine whether you are overadvertising or underadvertising? That’s one of the key reasons to
use test marketing. If a campaign is launched in several different, but matched, cities at different
levels of media activity, a comparison of the campaign results (sales or other kinds of trackable
responses) can determine the appropriate level and type of media spending.
Wearout The point where the advertising, because it has been seen multiple times, no longer
stimulates much of a response is called wearout. This is also the point where recall stabilizes or
declines and irritation levels increase because people are tired of hearing or seeing the same ad.
Wearout is a combination of creative impact and media buying. The more intrusive or the
less interesting the creative technique, the higher the level of irritation. It’s like a joke: you may
pay attention the first couple of times you hear it, but then it gets “old.” Other types of advertis-
ing are less prone to wearout. Good jingles, for example, can be repeated almost endlessly. The
more people like to hum along, the less likely there will be a wearout problem.
The issue is how long and how much is needed to create the necessary impact. John Philip
Jones, who has done extensive research into effectiveness issues, argues that research supports
higher continuity. He recommends spreading the budget out and adding weeks to the media
schedule as much as possible.19Another way to evaluate such decisions is through media opti-
mization models.

Anew dimension to the efficiency question comes from a program by media company Star-
com to measure the effectiveness of various media used by client Applebee’s. The objective was
to develop a model that compares the value of video ads, both on-air and online, across a number
of NBC properties. The model will establish the relative value of the ads and also interaction
across channels.20
EVALUATING IMC TOOLS, CAMPAIGNS, AND PROGRAMS
Evaluation is the final and, in some respects, most important step in an advertising campaign be-
cause it determines whether the campaign effort was effective. Acampaign evaluation will assess
the campaign’s performance in terms of its message and media objectives. It employs either in-
ternal performance data or results from an outside research organization that monitors brand per-
formance, such as Gallup-Robinson, Decision Analyst Inc., and Millward Brown. The important
thing to remember in planning an evaluation program is that evaluation has to be built into the
marketing communication plan from the very beginning.
An IMC campaign employs various marcom tools, such as sales promotion, public rela-
tions, direct marketing, events and sponsorships, personal sales, packaging, point of purchase
(PoP), and specialties. You’ll find that most of these areas have their own metrics by which per-
formance is measured.
Even though an IMC campaign is evaluated in terms of its overall impact on a brand, the
pieces of the mix may also be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of their performance. Ad-
vertising may be the most visible; however, other marketing communication tools, such as sales
promotion, are better at getting people to respond with an immediate purchase, and public rela-
tions is particularly strong at building credibility. Let’s look briefly at these other marketing com-
munication areas in terms of their evaluation.

Advertising How do you describe effective advertis-
ing? You’ve been watching it for most of your life. One
brand manager’s answer to that question is presented
in the Practical Tips at www.pearsonhighered.com/
moriarty. An examination of Table 19.2shows that ad-
vertising is particularly effective in accomplishing a
number of objectives, such as creating exposure,
awareness, and a brand’s image. It is also good at pro-
viding brand reminders to the customer and encourag-
ing repurchases. The preceding discussions about
copytesting, message development research, concur-
rent testing, post-testing, and the evaluation of media
cover the most common advertising methodologies.
Many of these research methods are used by other
marcom areas, but they all are derived initially from
advertising.
Evaluation doesn’t just happen at the end of a campaign or after
the ad is run. It has to be planned into the campaign from the Direct Response The objective of direct-response

who request more information or buy the product.
In some ways, direct response mechanisms are the easiest marketing communication tool to
evaluate both in terms of message effectiveness and in terms of ROI efficiency—the sales-to-cost
ratio. The efficiency of a direct-response offer is measured in terms of responses per thousand
(RPM). To calculate the RPM, use the following formula:

Sales Promotion Sales promotion programs for packaged goods and other products that use dis-
tribution channels need to evaluate both the impact of consumer (or end-user) direct promotions
and promotions targeted at retailers and other channel members. You will recall the discussions
of promotional allowances offered to retailers who agree to feature a brand in their ads or provide
special in-store display and price discounts. These are measured by proof of performance such as

copies of store ads and pictures of in-store displays. One responsibility of the sales force is to do
store checks to verify that stores are doing what they promised. Promotions that contain a re-
sponse device, such as coupons, have a built-in evaluation measure.
As for consumer promotions, the following evaluation measures are the most popular:

The efficiency of a sales promotion offer can be evaluated in terms of its financial returns
more easily than advertising. We compare the costs of a promotion, called a payout analysis,to
the forecasted sales generated by the promotion. Abreak-even analysisseeks to determine the
point at which the total cost of a promotion exceeds the total revenues generated, identifying the
point where the promotion is not wise to do. Figure 19.4depicts this analysis.

Ultimately, public relations
efforts are evaluated in ceptance and impact of the materials). Outcomes can be measured in terms of changes in public
terms of opinion change opinion and relationship tracking. The output evaluation is conducted by asking questions such
and relationship tracking. as these: How many placements (news releases that ran in the media) did we get? How many
times did our spokesperson appear on talk shows? How much airplay did our public service an-
nouncements receive or how much and what kind of buzz are Twitters generating? The results are
presented in terms of counts of minutes, mentions, or inches.
Content analysis also helps determine the favorability of the coverage, share of voice, and
issue and competitor coverage. Ongoing public opinion tracking studies ask these questions: Has
there been a change in audience knowledge, attitudes, or behavior (e.g., pretesting versus post-
testing)? Can we associate behavior change (e.g., product trial, repeat purchase, voting, or join-
ing) with the public relations effort? The most common measures of output and outcomes in
public relations are summarized here:
Output Objectives Achieved
• ProductionNumber of PR messages, such as news releases or brochures, generated.
• DistributionNumber of media outlets (TVstations, newspapers) receiving PR products.
• CoverageNumber and size of clips, column inches, or minutes of time or space.
• ImpressionsMedia placements multiplied by circulation or broadcast reach.
• Advertising ValueEquivalent ad costs for time or space.
• Content AnalysisPositive or valence (whether the story or mention seems to be more posi-
tive or negative), key messages (the idea in the story), sources, and prominence.
Outcome Objectives Achieved
• AwarenessAided and unaided recall.
• AttitudesPerceptions, preferences, and intent to buy.
• BehaviorDid target do what you wanted them to do?
The search for methods to tie public relations activities to bottom-line business measures,
such as ROI (return on investment), is like the quest for the Holy Grail. PR practitioners would
like to demonstrate ROI because it would provide even more support for the importance of PR
effects. Asurrogate ROI measure can be based on shareholder value, which can be seen as a com-
pany or brand’s reputation capital. For example, research conducted on companies with the most
effective employee communication programs has determined that they provide a much higher to-
tal return to shareholders. Recently Web-based analytical tools are making it possible to connect
earned media results to online business goals, such as generating website traffic, sales leads, rev-
enue, and donations for nonprofit organizations.21
CHAPTER 19 • EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS 597
Website Evaluation Evaluating the communica-
tion effects of website advertising is still a new game.
Some performance indicators are traffic volume,
such as page viewsor the simple number of visitors
to a site. Banner advertising and other online ads are
evaluated using click-through rates, and the one
thing the industry has learned is that this form of ad-
vertising is decreasing in effectiveness. One problem
is that people who have little or no interest in the
product may click on the banner by accident or cu-
riosity. Because this type of advertising is sold by
pay-per-click (PPC), the advertiser has to pay re-
gardless of the reason for the click. Pop-up banners
can get more attention, but they are also seen as more
irritating.
Instead of click-through rates, some advertis-
ing uses a cost-per-lead metric that records how
well the click-through generates prospects, an at-
tempt to get at ROI. The most important metric for
Internet advertising, however, is conversion rate,
which is the percentage of visitors to a site who com-
plete a desired action, such as playing a game, sign-
ing up for a newsletter, or buying something. Of
course, online sales are an important measure of a
website’s effectiveness.
The more sophisticated conversion rate ser-
Sales (in thousands of units)
vices not only measure how well the site generates
action but also how customers navigated the site.
This information is obtained by tracking where they
come from, what search terms they used, how they
move around within the website, and where they go
when they leave. It gives a more comprehensive pic-
ture of the path visitors and customers use in navi-
gating a site.
Forrester Research has been developing methods for evaluating websites for years. The
company tracks effectiveness of website performance in terms not only of making a brand prom-
ise, but in terms of also delivering easy-to-find and use information. Harley Manning, a Forrester
vice president, reported that his company’s research has found that “on average sites did a better
job of making the brand promise than they did of meeting customer needs.” Manning explains
how this research is used to evaluate good and bad performing websites in The Inside Story.
(Check Forrester’s website at www.forrester.com.)
Special Advertising Situations
The various types of advertising identified in Chapter 18are evaluated using many of the tools
discussed previously; however, they each have their own particular objectives that affect how
they are evaluated.
The primary objective of retail advertisingis to generate store traffic. The results of traffic-
building promotions and advertising are simple counts of transactions as well as the change in
sales volume of brands receiving promotional support. Participation counts can be used to esti-
mate the pull of special events. Loyalty is evidenced through participation in frequent buyer pro-
grams and measured in terms of registration, store visits, and average purchases per visit.

Like other types of advertising, nonprofit organizationsneed to communicate efficiently and
effectively, particularly as they are stewards who must ensure that limited funding is used effec-
tively and efficiently. Evaluation of communication for foundations and nonprofit organizations
is an emerging field, and challenges to assessing effectiveness are many. Activities and behaviors
being measured are complex and campaigns are often a multi-phase effort. There are no standard
and widely accepted guidelines for communication evaluation for the nonprofit sector. Nonethe-
less, measuring success of a campaign begins with setting objectives and evaluating the progress
toward achieving the objectives.22
International marcom is difficult to evaluate because of market differences (e.g., language,
laws, cultural norms) and the acceptability of various research tools. There may also be incompati-
bilities among various measurement systems and data analysis techniques that make it difficult to
compare the data from one market with similar data from another market. An international evalua-
tion program for advertising should focus, at least initially, on pretesting because unfamiliarity with
different cultures, languages, and consumer behaviors can result in major miscalculations. Pretest-
ing helps the advertiser correct major problems before miscommunication occurs. To evaluate the
global/local question, the best approach is to test two ads that are both based on the global adver-
tising strategy: a locally produced version of the advertising and an original ad produced locally.

University of Southern California Professor Gerard Tellis reminds us that advertising not
only has instantaneouseffects (consumer responds immediately) but also carryovereffects (de-
layed impact).23Any evaluation of campaign effectiveness needs to also be able to track both
types of effects over time. Differential effects also complicate the ongoing evaluation of IMC pro-
grams that operate with a 360-degree total communication philosophy, although tracking may be
easier in some ways because the evaluation is continuous.
The Synergy Problem The problem with evaluating campaigns—particularly IMC campaigns—
is estimating the impact of synergy. Intuitively we know that multichannel communication with
messages that reinforce and build on one another will have more impact than single messages
from single sources; however, that can be difficult to prove. As Bob Liodice, CEO of the Associ-
ation of National Advertisers, observes, “there is no single, consistent set of metrics that tran-
scends discipline-centric measurements.”24
If the campaign planning is well integrated, which means each specialty area cooperates with
all others in message design, delivery, and timing, then there should be a synergistic effect. This
means that the overall results are greater than the sum of the individual functional areas if used
separately.
Anumber of studies have attempted to evaluate IMC impact by comparing campaigns that use
two or three tools to see what is gained when more message sources are added to the mix. For ex-
ample, a study by the Radio Ad Effectiveness Lab reported that recall of advertising is enhanced when
a mix of radio and Internet ads are used rather than just website advertising alone.25Astudy published
in the Journal of Advertising Researchdeveloped a multidimensional approach based on evaluation
of four factors including unified and consistent communication, strategic consistency in targeting
(different messages for different audiences), database communication, and relationship programs.26
Such studies of both the platforms and components of IMC are beginning to tease out the effects of
synergy, but they are a long way from evaluating the effects of a total communication program.
The most common way of measuring a campaign’s total impact is the brand tracking ap-
proach mentioned previously. As various ingredients in the campaign are added and taken away,
changes in tracking study results can show the effects and help identify what combinations of
marketing communication functions and media work best for a brand. In other words, has the
brand become stronger on critical dimensions of the image, such as personality and positioning
cues, because of the campaign?
Acomplication in evaluating programs is the need to consider other messages and contact
points beyond traditional marketing communication. As we have said, in a 360-degree total com-
munication program, brand experiences, such as those involved with customer service and WoM,
may be even more important than traditional marketing communication. A Principled Practice
feature by Professor Keith Murray demonstrates how these unconventional message effects can
be measured.
Connecting the Dots The challenge in campaign and program evaluation is to pull everything
together and look at the big picture of campaign performance rather than the individual pieces
and parts. One of the first places to start is defining the objectives—all the various effects—and
then adequately and realistically measure the campaign’s performance against those objectives.
Here’s an example that demonstrates how evaluation methods can be matched to the original cam-
paign objectives.
Effie award winner UPS wanted to reposition itself by broadening its package delivery im-
age.27Although UPS owned ground delivery, it lost out to Federal Express in the overnight and
international package market. UPS knew from its customer research that to break out of the
“brown and ground” perception, the company had to overcome the inertia of shipping managers
who use UPS for ground packages and FedEx for overnight and international. The company also
had to shift the perception of senior executives from a company that handles packages to a strate-
gic partner in systems planning. From these insights came three sets of objectives that focused on

breaking through awareness, breaking the inertia trance, and breaking the relevance trance.
Here’s how the campaign performed on those objectives. Notice the mix of perception, image,
and behavioral measures.
Objective 1:Breaking through Awareness
• Awareness of the Brown campaign outpaced allpast UPS advertising measured in the
10-plus-year history of its brand tracking study.
• Amongthoseawareofthecampaign,correctbrandlinkagetoUPSwas95to98percentacross
allaudiences(comparedtoahistoricalaverageof20to40percentforpastUPSadvertising).
CHAPTER 19 • EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS 601
• “What Can BROWN Do for You?” has taken hold in popular culture. For instance, the
tagline was mentioned in both Saturday Night LiveandTrading Spacesshows.
Objective 2:Breaking the Inertia Trance
• With shipping decision makers, the brand showed steady and significant gains in key mea-
sures like “Helps my operation run more smoothly,” “Dynamic and energetic,” and “Offers a
broad range of services.”
• International shipping profitability increased 150 percent, and overnight volume spiked by
9.1 percent after the campaign ran. The targeted companies’total package volume increased
by 4.39 percent.
• From the start of the campaign in March to the year-end, annual ground shipping revenue
grew by $300 million.
• The campaign was a hit in terms of response with a 10.5 percent response rate and an ROI of
1:3.5. In other words, every dollar spent on the campaign generated $3.5 dollars in revenue.
Objective 3:Breaking the Relevance Trance
• For the first time in the 10-plus-year history of the brand tracking study, UPS leads FedEx in
all image measures among senior-level decision makers. All significant brand image measures
continued upward.
• Among senior decision makers, the biggest gains were in key measures like “For people like
me,” “Acts as a strategic partner to my company,” “Helps in distribution and supply chain
operations,” and “Provides global competitive advantage.”
• At the start of the campaign, annual nonpackage (supply chain) revenue was approxi-
mately $1.4 billion. By the end of the year, nonpackage revenue had almost doubled to
$2.7 billion.
Bringing It All Together Beyond connecting the objectives to the measurements, advertisers
continue to search for methods that will bring all the metrics together and efficiently and effec-
tively evaluate—and predict—brand communication effectiveness. Asmall Florida agency, Zim-
merman Advertising, positions itself specifically on that issue. It promises to deliver long-term
brand building as well as short-term sales. The president explains, “The biggest problem mar-
keters face today is connecting advertising to retail sales.” To help determine the impact of its ads
on sales, Zimmerman measures ad response immediately using a toll-free number and proprietary
software that tracks sales to specific ads.28
The giant media research company, Nielsen, has undertaken a project to find the links in its
various marketing metrics. In particular, the company wants to connect its Nielsen Media Re-
search TVratings with its A.C. Nielsen retail scanner and consumer panel data. Then it wants to
mix in data from its Nielsen/NetRatings for online advertising and Nielsen Buzzmetrics online-
buzz measurement system.29This is just one example of how important it is to connect the dots
to draw an accurate picture of consumer response to marketing communication.

Many pieces are still missing in the evaluation of advertising, not to mention more complex
IMC programs. Research think tanks are struggling to find better ways to measure consumers’
emotional connections to brands and brands’relationships with their customers31and how those
connections and relationships are affected by various types of marketing communication mes-
sages. But let’s end with an inspirational video called “Life Lessons from an Ad Man.” It’s a lit-

IT’S A WRAP
The Colorado Pass Club
Comes to Pass
In this final chapter we have reviewed various methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a campaign. No
campaign uses all of them, but all successful campaigns have to do some kind of evaluation in order to de-
termine success. The Colorado Pass is an example of an IMC program that carefully monitors its marketing
communication messages to evaluate the effectiveness of its brand-relationship building objectives. Jennifer
Wolfe-Kimbell, senior marketing manager at Vail Resorts, explains how this program has been evaluated.
Our marketing mix for season-pass sales includes e-mail campaigns, direct-mail campaigns, online ban-
ner advertising, newspaper print in local and regional papers, local radio spots, and local TV spots. The passes
are sold online and onsite at retail locations, resort ticket offices, and special events throughout Colorado and
the region.

2008/2009 ski season was a 12.2 percent increase, which is greater than the increase in the number of passes
sold for the 2007/2008 ski season. Combined with an 8.3 percent increase in the pass price, these results drove
a 21.8 percent increase in season-pass revenue.
Season-pass holders skied more on average in the 2008/2009 ski season than the previous year. They
used the season pass an average of 10.6 times in 2008/2009 compared to 9.7 times per season pass in the
prior season.
Fiscal Year 2010 Results (Based on Second Quarter Results)Vail Resorts experienced a $3.1 million or 6.2 per-
centincrease in total season-pass revenue including the Colorado Pass. The increase in season-pass revenue
was generated in spite of overall flat visitation from all skiers, as well as season-pass holders, and fewer visits
per pass. This demonstrated the value of the program, even in periods of challenging snow conditions. Despite
adverse factors such as historically low snowfall and a struggling economy, we were pleased with the outcome
of our brand-relationship building efforts. This positive report on the company was attributed to the following:
• The strength of the pass programs. In fact, decline in out-of-state visitation was mitigated by growth in vis-
its from local season-pass holders, which was up 17 percent.
• Higher guest expenditures on ski school and retail sales and rentals.
• A 9 percent increase in the number of season passes sold. In fact, record season-pass sales locked in higher
revenue prior to the start of the season (despite fewer pass visits) further illustrating the strength and im-
portance of our pass programs.
Our pass holders loved the CPC Club—and Vail Resorts loved the results, as well.

THE STUPID DRINK: THE DRINK BETWEEN
DRINKING . . . AND DRINKING TOO MUCH
The following case was written by Edward Russell, associate professor of advertising at the
S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New
York. Professor Russell is the faculty adviser to The NewHouse, a student-run advertising
agency on the campus of Syracuse University and winner of the 2009 American Advertis-
ing Federation National Student Advertising Competition. The competition is the oldest
and largest advertising competition in the United States.
How Do You Curb Binge Drinking on College Campuses?
Drinking on college campuses is absolutely frightening! Every year there are
countless DUI’s,arrests,unwanted sexual advances and worst of all . . . nearly
2,000 students a year die of alcohol poisoning. We must do something and we
must do something right now!
This isn’t a problem. Drinking is fun. College is all about meeting new peo-
ple,becoming independent from your parents and having the time of your life.
The problem? Both completely opposite points of view are legitimate. Drinking can be dan-
gerous and drinking can be a fun social event. So how do you get people to stop doing
something they enjoy?
TRENDS IN COLLEGE BINGE DRINKING
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism’s National Advisory Council de-
fines binge drinking as such:
A binge is a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings blood alcohol concentration
(BAC) to .08 or above. For a typical adult,this pattern corresponds to consum-
ing five or more drinks in a two-hour span for men or four or more drinks in a
two-hour span for women.
According to a U.S.-based “Monitoring the Future” study, 45% of male college stu-
dents reported binge drinking and 37% of female students binge drink. But this isn’t a U.S.
problem; the same trends show up in Europe, Australia, Asia, and South America. College
students drink heavily; they always have.
You might assume that with all of the emphasis on healthy living in our culture today
that binge drinking, like smoking, would be on the decline. You would be wrong. Binge
drinking on college campuses has remained pretty steady since 1993.
605
606 APPENDIX
What happens to binge drinkers? According to the CORE Institute at Southern Illinois
University at Carbondale, 63% of college students reported having a hangover, 54% were
nauseous, 38% did something they regretted later, 34% experienced memory loss, 31%
missed a class, etc., etc., etc. While no one would ever rationally choose to feel badly the
next morning, these problems aren’t such a big deal to a college student. Let’s just say, the
risk-to-fun ratio generally falls in favor of the fun part.
Although the legal drinking age in the United States is 21, it isn’t that difficult for a
college student to get alcohol on most campuses. It’s nearly impossible for the authorities
to enforce the law as drinking gets pushed deeper and deeper underground. According to a
2006 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, approximately 1% of 12-year-olds report
drinking enough to qualify as binge drinking. This percentage of the population who are
binge drinkers increases every year until it peaks with 50% of 21-year-olds being binge
drinkers.
It almost seems silly to ask in a college textbook why college students drink. You know
the answer. It can be fun. The CORE study showed that 74% say it gives them something
to do, 62% say it allows you to have more fun, and 58% of males and 48% of females say
consuming alcohol facilitates bonding.
THE PROBLEM
How do we curb an activity (binge drinking) that is associated with more positive experi-
ences than negative experiences for students? We had to start with obvious solutions.
Tougher enforcement! But how? Police can’t be everywhere all the time. Bar raids and
checking IDs in liquor stores can only go so far toward curbing accessibility to alcohol.
It’s simply not practical to think we can stop underage binge drinking this way. The laws
are already in place and enforced, and the problem is still with us. We can’t solve the
problem legally.
Just say no. Students hate authorities telling them what to do and not do. At the very time
they are experiencing their first taste of independence, well-meaning groups that try to
tell them not to drink, smoke, eat transfats, or whatever are unwelcome voices and aren’t
effective. If that type of message worked, the problem would have been solved decades
ago. The authoritarian approach to stopping binge drinking simply does not work.
Inform them of the consequences. Everyone reading this knows there are serious poten-
tial consequences associated with the overconsumption of alcohol. However, we also all
believe we are invincible. Bad things happen to other people. Telling people what they
already know but don’t believe doesn’t work.
Turn off the culture. Movies, TV, YouTube videos, thousands of websites, fraternities,
sororities, beer and liquor companies with multimillion-dollar advertising budgets all
tell us constantly that drinking with friends is fun; in fact, it is often portrayed as hilari-
ous. You can’t turn off the culture, and you can’t be dishonest.
We knew what wasn’t working; we didn’t know what would work. So we started look-
ing around the world of public service advertising at case studies and award-winning work
and interviewed experts from other industries. Well-meaning failed communications cam-
paigns outnumber successful case studies in this area by at least ten to one. However, no
other attempt rang as true and had the business results to prove its success as much as the
truth® campaign for the American Legacy Foundation created by Arnold Worldwide and
Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky. Clearly, there is a difference between stopping cigarette smok-
ing among teens and curbing binge drinking on college campuses, but there was a lot we
could learn here. Our biggest lesson was we had to identify a “bad guy.” One of the bril-
liant ideas behind the truth campaign is that it didn’t attempt to blame you, the user. It
blamed the tobacco company instead. We had a similar situation. Drinking isn’t bad; out-
of-control binge drinking is.
APPENDIX 607
Research: What We Learned about Drinking—Yours and Our Own
So how do we curb binge drinking on college campuses? It took the AAF NSAC team from
Syracuse University 1,556 in-depth surveys, 75 expert interviews, 15 observational ethnog-
raphies, a deprivation study, and a review of journal articles to discover one very simple
observation:
Freshmen drink very differently than seniors.
Freshmen tend to get together, drink a lot fast to get as drunk as possible, and be social
around people they don’t yet know. Seniors get together with friends they value and share
a few drinks to enjoy those times more. That’s a huge piece of information.
Think about this: When you were a freshmen, chances are you “learned” to drink with
other freshmen who also didn’t really know how to drink. No wonder we drink too much
too fast. Over four years of college we actually “learn” to drink.
Then it occurred to us . . . what if we could shorten the learning process?What if we
could take the four years of “learning to drink” and shorten that into three to six months?
Would that curb binge drinking? We weren’t sure. So, we went to bars and frat houses to
observe binge drinkers in their environment. We observed them before they drank, while
they drank, and even the morning after they drank. We talked to students about binge drink-
ing and found out that nearly no one thinks of himself or herself as a “binge drinker.” To
the students, the term “binge” implies people that aren’t capable of limiting their con-
sumption of alcohol. These students aren’t alcoholics; they’re just partying and having a
great time. Sure it gets out of control once in a while, but they definitely don’t see that as a
“problem.”
So we changed the words we used. Instead of talking about “binge” drinking, we
talked about “drinking too much.” Just changing the terminology we used caused a radical
change in the responses we received. Students know what drinking too much is. Most had
experienced it firsthand; all had seen it for themselves.
There is a line between “drinking” (which can be a lot of fun) and “drinking too much”
(which can lead to unwelcome consequences). The more we discussed the idea of this line,
the more we realized we had all crossed the line at one time or another, and none of us re-
ally wanted to cross it again.
Strategy: What We Want to Do and What We Want to Communicate
We want to “curb underage binge drinking.” We aren’t trying to stop drinking. As communi-
cators, it is crucial that we accept what we can change and what we can’t change. College stu-
dents are going to drink. However, if we can speed up this learning process of “how to drink”
we have the potential of avoiding unwelcome consequences and maybe even saving lives.
We headed back to the bars and fraternity houses to try and figure out wherethat line
is. But, it’s not a line. It’s a drink. The line between drinking and drinking too much is ac-
tually one drink. There is one drink between “in control” and “out of control.” There is one
drink between a fun night with friends and a night of regrettable consequences. There is one
drink where your judgment decreases and consumption increases.
We decided to name our “bad guy.” We didn’t have to look very far to hear how stu-
dents refer to drinking too much. Acollege student in one of our focus groups referred to
his weekend as “getting stupid” and the name “The Stupid Drink” stuck.
Strategy Our strategy was to teach students how to drink responsibly by identifying and
stigmatizing the one drink (The Stupid Drink) that separates enjoyable drinking from
negative consequences that occur from drinking too much. In doing this, we hypothe-
sized we could greatly reduce the prevalence of binge drinking on college campuses.
Target audience Naive drinkers on college campuses who haven’t yet learned how to
drink responsibly. They tend to be freshmen and sophomores away from home for the
first time, but can also be juniors and seniors caught up in out-of-control social drinking
situations.
608 APPENDIX
The “Big Idea” The Stupid Drink is the drink between drinking and drinking too much.
For some, The Stupid Drink might be indicated by a feeling; for some, a number of
drinks; and for others, it might even be one type of alcohol such as tequila.
Tonality We know authoritarian messages don’t work with this newly independent young
adult. And although students respond well to humor, we have to be extremely careful we
don’t allow the seriousness of the message to get lost.
Confirming Our Strategy
Before we began creating communications, we tested the idea. We explained the concept to
a group of serious college drinkers and checked back with them after a weekend of party-
ing. It worked. Our test group reported back that they figured out where their Stupid Drink
was and to a person really didn’t wantto drink beyond that. They reported having a lot more
fun and feeling a lot better the day after. They were sold. And, they were safe.
We realized we had come upon a universal insight. We all have a stupid drink—
professors, students, parents, etc. There is one drink between being in control and out of
control for all of us.
Students also talked about how easy it was to talk about their “stupid drink” around
friends as well as tell others when they were beyond their stupid drink. We knew for our
concept to be effective, the term had to be very natural in any setting. This was all becom-
ing very exciting.
CREATIVE EXECUTIONS
The plan for our messaging is to begin several weeks before freshmen get to campus with
a postcard sent home announcing the discovery of The Stupid Drink and encouraging stu-
dents to check out The Drinking Institute online. Because we wanted to “teach” our fellow
students safe and responsible drinking habits, we created a fictitious “Drinking Institute”
headed by friendly scientists such as Bill Ney, the Science Guy. In a television commercial
and viral video, The Drinking Institute announces its revolutionary discovery after years of
research. It discovered The Stupid Drink—the drink between drinking and drinking too
much.
The Drinking Institute website allows students to visit this fictitious institute, roam the
halls, do experiments on subjects, and come to their own conclusion about drinking too
much. AFacebook application allows students to tag their friends with “symptoms of stu-
pid” after they have gone too far such as “handsy friend.” Is your best friend slurring her
speech? Our mobile messaging application allows you to text another with her “symptom
of stupid” during a party. Drinking at a sporting event? The Stupid Drink billboard will
prove an effective reminder at just the right time.
Bars love people who drink and have a good time. They don’t like patrons who get
sick in the bar or go out and get hurt afterward. Our bar coasters with cute definitions of
The Stupid Drink such as “the line between ‘I’m good’and ‘my bad’” and The Stupid Drink
ID stamp will allow bars to remind patrons to have a great time, but not to go beyond their
stupid drink. If you are drinking beer in a bar, sooner or later you will visit the restroom
where our Symptoms of Stupid bathroom posters will remind you that you don’t want to
make a fool of yourself by exhibiting one of these symptoms (e.g., dancing like a “pro” or
“personal space invasion”).
We want to not only build a general awareness of The Stupid Drink idea, we want to
get as close to the actual drinking situation as possible. We want The Stupid Drink message
to be in the bars, in the fraternity parties, in the dorms—wherever college students go to
drink.
Promotions and Public Relations
Curbing binge drinking among college students is a huge task. We want to enlist the help
of those who care the most about this. That’s why we created a website for college admin-
APPENDIX 609
istrators to share their best practices with each other, and for parents to learn about what to
expect and how they can help their child become a responsible, safe independent adult.
Press releases will celebrate the discovery of The Stupid Drink and campus events will
help bring the message as close to the actual drinking event as possible. We developed a
“Shoot Till You Miss” beer pong game but instead of beer, participants win prizes. But, hit
the middle glass, The Stupid Drink, and it’s game over. Urban Dictionary and Wikipedia
entries for The Stupid Drink give it credibility and legitimacy.
Media
There is never enough money in advertising to accomplish all you want to, but by invest-
ing the money smartly you can maximize the impact of your plan. Our $10 million plan will
go a long way toward helping us curb binge drinking.
To stretch our budget, we divided the colleges into Tier 1 and Tier 2 schools based on
alcohol consumption and size of campus (per The Princeton Reviewlist of “Party Schools”
andPlayboy’s list of party schools). The Tier 1 schools would receive the full program with
all advertising executions. Tier 2 schools would receive a reduced level in part because the
drinking problem isn’t as severe at these schools.
At Syracuse University, we no longer talk about “traditional vs. nontraditional” me-
dia. With this generation, the world is their medium and anything is possible. Viral videos,
websites, Facebook applications, mobile messaging, Twitter, bar coasters, search engine
optimization, campus newspapers, postcards, stadium billboards, cable television (e.g.,
MTV, ESPN, VH-1, and Comedy Central), dorm room stickers and posters, sidewalk
clings, decks of cards, and bar stamps all worked together to deliver our message from
August through May to 967 colleges and universities, 7,500,000 college students or 74%
of the entire student population.
But will The Stupid Drink campaign curb binge drinking on college campuses? Our
postevaluation research clearly demonstrated that 95% of college students understood our
message and 89% reported that they actually thought about the idea while out drinking. If
we are right, almost no one reading this now will look at drinking too much in the same way
again.
