It is renowned for being one of the most-watched television events in the United States, attracting a large audience and high television ratings. The Super Bowl is particularly noted for its high-profile halftime shows and commercials, which are significant advertising opportunities for brands. Commercial slots during the Super Bowl are highly coveted, with costs exceeding $3 million for a 30-second spot, and some commercials, such as those in 2010, were even filmed in 3-D. The event serves as a benchmark for media planning, with a cost per thousand impressions (CPM) of $56 to reach 44 million viewers. The Super Bowl's audience is predominantly male, making it an ideal platform for launching products targeted at this demographic, such as Dove's Men+Care line. Brands use the Super Bowl to reach a mass audience and shape public perceptions, as demonstrated by Budweiser's use of the event in their dealer loader promotion and Frontier's advertisement announcing Flip's trip to Mexico. Overall, the Super Bowl is a major sporting event in the United States, known for its significant impact on advertising and media.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1741374042, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eb9dce56a8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 247, "prompt_tokens": 484, "total_tokens": 731, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
