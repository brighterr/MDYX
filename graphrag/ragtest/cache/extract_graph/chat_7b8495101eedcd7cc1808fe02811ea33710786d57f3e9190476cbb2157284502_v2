In addition to the AAF and AdColor programs, many local\nadvertising and marketing groups are sponsoring diversity programs in their communities.\nPositioning\nPrinciple Another reason we revisit targeting here is because understanding the target is the first step in un-\nThe goal of positioning is derstanding the brand’s position within the competitive marketplace. The objective is to establish\nto locate a product in the in the consumer’s mind what the brand offers and how it compares with the competition. A\nconsumer’s mind based on position,then, is how consumers define the product or brand in comparison to its competitors. A\nits features and position is based on two things: first, a particular feature or attribute—Coke Zero is low calorie\nadvantages relative to its but tastes like regular Coke. The feature also can be psychological, such as heritage (Kodak or\ncompetition.\nHallmark). Secondly, that feature must be important to the consumer.\nAclassic example of positioning is the campaign for Avis, which used the line “We Try\nHarder” to describe how it competes against category leader Hertz. The line was not only a good\npositioning statement, it also was named as one of the Top 10 Slogans of the 20th Century. The\ncampaign was described by the fathers of positioning, Jack Trout and Al Ries, in their ground-\nbreaking book Positioning:The Battle for Your Mind.8\nAposition is based on some notion of comparison. Is the brand more expensive or less; is it\na status product or a symbol of frugality; is it sporty, functional, safe or extremely risky? Wal-\nmart’s position, for example, is encompassed in its slogan, “Always Low Prices.” Positioning,\nthen, is about locking the brand in consumers’minds based on some quality relevant to them\nwhere the brand stands out. Compare the positioning strategies of the various arms of the U.S.\nmilitary as they represent themselves in their ads.\nPositionsaredifficulttoestablishandarecreatedovertime.Onceestablished,theyarediffi-\nculttochange,asKodakdiscoveredwithitsownershipofthefilmcategorywhenthemarketmoved\ntodigitalpictures.Categorydominanceisimportant,asAlRies,oneofthefoundersoftheposi-\ntioningconcept,argues,butsometimesthecategorychangesandthebrandhastochangeaswellor\ngetleftbehind.Tobetterunderstandpositioningstrategy,let’sconsiderrelatedconceptsusedtode-\nfinethecompetitivesituation—productfeaturesandattributes,differentiation,andcompetitivead-\nvantage.Thenwe’llreturntohowadvertisingestablishesapositioninacompetitivemarketplace.\nPrinciple Product Features and Attributes An initial step in crafting a position is to identify the features\nPositioning identifies the of the brand, as well as those of the competition, to determine where the brand has an advantage\nfeatures that make a over its competitors. Amarketer carefully evaluates the product’s tangible features (such as size,\nbrand different from its color, design, price, and ease of use) and other intangible attributes (such as quality, status, value,\ncompetitors and relevant fashion, and safety) to identify the dimensions of the product that are relevant to its customers\nto consumers\nand that make it different from its competitors.\nAn interesting twist on features developed when the electric hybrid cars, such as GM’s Volt,\nwere introduced to the market. The standard MPG estimate of fuel efficiency was turned upside\ndown with projections of 230 MPG for Volt and 367 MPG for the Nissan Leaf. Of course, these\ncars use very little gas as long as they are running on their batteries—gas is only used when the\ncharge runs out. If you only use the car to run around town, theoretically you could get unlimited\ngas mileage.9So what does this changing standard do to traditional car-buying marketing and de-\ncision making?\nDifferentiation and Competitive Advantage Most markets involve a high level of competition.\nHow does a company compete in a crowded market? It uses product differentiation,a strategy\ndesigned to focus attention on product differences that are important to consumers and that dis-\ntinguish the company’s product from that of its competitors. We refer to products that really are\nthe same (examples include milk, unleaded gas, and over-the-counter drugs) as undifferentiated\norparity products.For these products marketers often promote intangible, or psychological, dif-\nferences, particularly through branding.\nThe creation of a unique brand image for a product (think Swatch) is the most obvious way\nto differentiate one product from another. Internet-based Mozilla and Craigslist are small com-\npanies but big brands that are strong because they have the support of dedicated users. This strong\ncustomer–brand relationship reflects a leadership position—a brand that has defined or created\nCHAPTER 7 • STRATEGIC PLANNING 203\nIn these four ads for the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marines, can you perceive a difference in their positioning strategies?\nHow do they communicate their positions in the style, copy, and graphics?
