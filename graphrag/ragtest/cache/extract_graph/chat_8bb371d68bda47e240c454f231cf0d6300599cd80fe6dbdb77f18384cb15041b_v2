Even the audience watching from their living rooms was inclined to join\nin with applause as part of this graceful display of respect and appreciation. It was touch-\ning. Memorable. Beautifully photographed. And the people seemed real, not rehearsed. But\nwas it an effective ad? What was it trying to accomplish? Did the viewers remember it as\nan Anheuser-Busch ad and, if so, did it affect their opinions of that company and its brands?\nWhat is effective advertising? Is it marketing communication that gets talked about?\nIs it a message like the Anheuser-Busch commercial that touches your emotions and in-\nspires you to applaud? What, exactly, does it mean to say that an advertisement “works”?\nOur answer is that brand communication is effective if it creates a desired response in\nthe audience. Abrand message that worksis advertising that affects people; it gets results\nthat can be measured. To better understand how this impact is created by a message, this\ntextbook will highlight the principles and best practices of the industry.\nPrinciples & Practiceuses the Facets Model of Advertising Effectsto better explain\nbrand communication strategies, consumer responses, and effectiveness. The facets model\nis like a diamond or a crystal whose surfaces represent the different types of responses gen-\nerated by a brand message. This model and the ideas it represents are used throughout the\nbook to help explain such things as how objectives are decided on, what strategies deliver\nwhat kind of effects, and how an advertisement and other forms of marketing communica-\ntion are evaluated based on their objectives.\nPrinciples & Practices\nMarketing communication messages are part inspiration and part hard work, but they are\nalso a product of clear and logical thinking. Ultimately marketing communication is eval-\nuated on its ability to generate a desired consumer response that meets a set of carefully\ncrafted objectives.\nIn most cases, consumers have little idea what the objectives are because that infor-\nmation generally isn’t made public—and you sometimes can’t tell from the ad itself. But\nthink about the “Applause” ad. From what we’ve told you, what do you think the ad’s ob-\n8\nCHAPTER KEY POINTS\nThe Creative Side\n1.Howdoweexplainthescienceandartofcreativestrategy,aswellastheimportantpartsofa\ncreativebrief?\n2.What are some key message strategy approaches?\n3.Can creative thinking be defined,and how does it lead to a Big Idea?\n4.What characteristics do creative people have in common,and what is their typical creative process?\n5.What issues affect the management of creative strategy and its implementation?\nFrontier: A Whole Different Animal\nWhenlow-costcarrierFrontierAirlinesstartedupin1994,ittookoffwith\nanimalsemblazonedonthetailsofitsplanes.Frontier’sdistinctiveair-\ncrafttails,allofwhichdepictavarietyofdifferentwildlife,havemade\nFrontier’sbrandnamesynonymouswiththeairline’sWesternheritage.Yearsof\naward-winningadvertisinghavefirmlyestablishedtheairlinewithitstalkinganimals\nontheplanes’tailsasafavoriteofconsumersintheDenvermarketandbeyond.\nThe economic downturn of 2008 and 2009, however, grounded much of Fron-\ntier’s advertising as the airline was forced into bankruptcy because of a cash-flow\nproblem. Luckily, it emerged from the downturn with a new owner who recognized\nthe value of the brand and its award-winning advertising.\nFrontier’s agency, Grey Worldwide, realized that Denverites were elated that\ntheir hometown airline and its beloved animals would live to see another day. A\nnarrow window to celebrate this great news emerged. And once again, Creative\nDirectors Shawn Couzens and Gary Ennis turned to Larry, Jack, Flip, and the rest\nof the gang for the perfect solution. The campaign had to be written and produced\nquickly and affordably—so it could air while the news was still fresh. And so, in just\na few short weeks, the “Still the One” campaign was born.\nThis is just one example of how nimble the Frontier campaign is. No matter\nwhat the message, or how quick the turnaround, the animals can always deliver it\nin a way that’s engaging and relevant. In fact, the animals have proven so popular,\nthey may end up being the airline’s single most important asset when it comes to\nthe brand’s ultimate survival.\nSo how did it all start? In 2003, Grey Worldwide brought the tail animals to life\nby creating a likable cast of characters—each different and unique in its own way.\nThe humorous ad campaign broke away from the buttoned-up approach used by\nCampaigns: Company: Agency: Awards: most airlines by creating an “episodic sitcom” much like SeinfeldorCheers.As a\n“Still the One,” Frontier Airlines Grey Worldwide Gold Effie (for sustained success), Silver result, consumers built an emotional attachment to the brand and its spokes-\n“Flip to Mexico,” C\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
