Weighting strategies are also used size of the sign and the duration of its appearance.\nin terms of seasonality, geography, audience segments,\nand the level of brand development by DMA.\nStep 4: Media Metrics and Analytics\nLike every other aspect of marketing communication, media plans are driven by questions of ac-\ncountability. And because media decisions are based on measurable factors, identifiable costs, and\nbudget limitations, media planners are engrossed in calculating the impact and efficiency of their\nmedia recommendations. As a MediaBank executive said, “Media departments are no place for\nguessing. With millions—even tens or hundreds of millions—of dollars at stake, clients want hard\ndata showing that their budgets are being well spent.”6\nImpact:GRPsandTRPs Amongthemostimportanttoolsmediaplannersuseindesigningame-\ndiamixisacalculationofamediaschedule’sgrossratingpointsandtargetedratingpoints.Aswe’ve\nsuggested,reachandfrequencyareinterrelatedconceptsthat,whencombined,generateanestimate\ncalledgrossratingpoints.Grossratingpoints,orGRPs,indicatetheweight,orefficiency,ofame-\ndiaplan.ThemoreGRPsinaplan,themore“weight”themediabuyissaidtodeliver.\nTo find a plan’s GRPs, you multiply each media vehicle’s rating by the number of ads\ninsertedintoeachmediavehicleduringthedesignatedtimeperiodandaddupthetotalforthe\nvehicles.\nOnce the media vehicles that produce the GRPs have been identified, computer programs can\nbe used to break down the GRPs into reach and frequency (R&F) numbers. These R&F models are\nbased on consumer media use research and produce data showing to what extent audiences, view-\ners, and readers overlap.\nTo illustrate how GRPs are determined and the difference in R&F from one media plan to an-\nother (using the same budget), look at the two media mixes that follow. Both are for a simple TV\nmedia plan for a pizza brand. As you will remember from Chapter 12, a rating pointis 1 percent\nof a defined media universe (country, region, DMA, or some other target audience description) of\nhouseholds unless otherwise specified. Insertionsare the number of ads placed in each media ve-\nhicle/program within a given period of time (generally four weeks). For example, in Table 14.1, if\n436 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nthe plan delivered a household rating of 6 with eight insertions, the program Survivor would\nachieve an estimated 48 GRPs.\nUsing the same budget, the two different media mixes produce different GRPtotals. Agood me-\ndia planner will look at several different mixes of programs that reach the target audience, figure the\nGRPs for each, and then break this calculation into R&F estimates for each plan. Because ratings are\nin percentages, the GRPs in both the plans in these tables indicate they reach more than 100 percent.\nOf course, this is impossible, just as it’s impossible to eat 156 percent of a pie. This is why these num-\nbers are called gross rating points; they include exposure duplication. Nevertheless, knowing the\nGRPs of different plans is helpful in choosing which plan delivers more for the money budgeted.\nHow would computer models calculate reach and frequency numbers based on achieving\n208 GRPs in plan A? The media mix model would estimate something close to the following:\nR(cid:4)35, F (cid:4)6.9. (Even though reach is a percent, industry practice is to not use the percent sign\nfor reach numbers.) For plan B where the number of GRPs is 176, the estimated R&F would be\nR(cid:4)55, F (cid:4)3.2.\nTable 14.1A Calculating GRPs for Plan A (R (cid:4)35; F (cid:4)6.9)\nProgram HH Rating Insertions GRPs\nSurvivor 6 8 48\nLost 7 8 56\nAmerican Idol 9 8 72\n24 4 8 32\nTotal 208\nTable 14.1B Calculating GRPs for Plan B (R (cid:4)55; F (cid:4)3.2)\nSurvivor 6 8 48\nDesperate Housewives 7 8 56\nBoston Legal 5 8 40\nMonday Night Football 4 8 32\nTotal 176\nHow do you decide which is best? If a brand has a tightly targeted audience and wants to use\nrepetition to create a strong brand presence, then plan Amight be a wise choice because it has a\nhigher frequency (6.9 vs. 3.2). If, however, a brand has a fairly simple message where frequency\nis less important, a planner would probably choose plan B because it has significantly higher\nreach. The reason for the higher reach (55 vs. 35) with plan B, even though it has fewer GRPs, is\nthat plan B has a much more diverse set of programs that attract a more diverse audience than\nPrinciple\nplan A. But because plan B has a higher reach, it also has a lower frequency.\nReach and frequency are\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WALL STREET JOURNAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Wall Street Journal is a prominent newspaper that is advertised using transit advertising, such as on taxis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDIABANK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MediaBank is a company involved in media planning and analytics, emphasizing accountability and data-driven decisions in media spending)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SURVIVOR<|>EVENT<|>Survivor is a television program used in media planning to achieve a certain number of gross rating points (GRPs))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOST<|>EVENT<|>Lost is a television program used in media planning to achieve a certain number of gross rating points (GRPs))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN IDOL<|>EVENT<|>American Idol is a television program used in media planning to achieve a certain number of gross rating points (GRPs))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>24<|>EVENT<|>24 is a television program used in media planning to achieve a certain number of gross rating points (GRPs))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES<|>EVENT<|>Desperate Housewives is a television program used in media planning to achieve a certain number of gross rating points (GRPs))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOSTON LEGAL<|>EVENT<|>Boston Legal is a television program used in media planning to achieve a certain number of gross rating points (GRPs))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL<|>EVENT<|>Monday Night Football is a television program used in media planning to achieve a certain number of gross rating points (GRPs))\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WALL STREET JOURNAL<|>MEDIABANK<|>MediaBank provides media planning and analytics services that could be used to optimize advertising strategies for organizations like the Wall Street Journal<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SURVIVOR<|>LOST<|>Both Survivor and Lost are part of a media plan to achieve a certain number of GRPs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SURVIVOR<|>AMERICAN IDOL<|>Both Survivor and American Idol are part of a media plan to achieve a certain number of GRPs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SURVIVOR<|>24<|>Both Survivor and 24 are part of a media plan to achieve a certain number of GRPs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES<|>BOSTON LEGAL<|>Both Desperate Housewives and Boston Legal are part of a media plan to achieve a certain number of GRPs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES<|>MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL<|>Both Desperate Housewives and Monday Night Football are part of a media plan to achieve a certain number of GRPs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOSTON LEGAL<|>MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL<|>Both Boston Legal and Monday Night Football are part of a media plan to achieve a certain number of GRPs<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
