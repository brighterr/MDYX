Another practice is co-branding, which is a strategy that\nuses two brand names owned by two separate companies to cre-\nate a partnership offering. Co-branding is a common practice for\ncredit cards, such as the Visa and United Airlines Mileage Plus\ncard. The new brand name is Mileage Plus but the card carries\nboth the Visa and United Airlines identity information. The idea\nis that the partnership provides customers with value from both\nbrands.\nAstrong brand may be attractive to other business partners,\nas well, through a practice called brand licensing. In effect, a\npartner company rents the brand name and transfers some of its\nbrand equity to another product. The most common example\ncomes from sport teams whose names and logos are licensed to\nmakers of all kinds of goods—shirts, caps, mugs, and other\nmemorabilia. You may also be aware of the practice of brand li-\ncensing for your own school. Universities and colleges generate\nlots of money by licensing their names, logos, and mascots to\napparel makers, among many others.\nAnother way to leverage a brand is through ingredient\nbranding,which refers to the use of a brand name for a com-\nponent used in manufacturing in advertising and other promo-\ntion. The most well-known example is the “Intel Inside”\nphrase and logo used by other computer makers to call atten-\ntion to the quality of the chips it uses in manufacturing its\nproducts. Other examples of bragging about the quality of\ncomponents are found in advertising for outdoor wear that\nannounces the use of Gore-Tex, a lightweight, warm, water-\nresistant fabric, and in food advertising that promotes the use\nof NutraSweet or Hershey’s chocolate.

One is its focus on brand-\ning and brand communication. Duncan and Mulhern, the authors of a symposium report, explain\nthat, “IMC is, among other things, a process for doing advertising and promotion better and more\neffectively in the process of building brands.”16\nTom Duncan, one of the architects of this new professional area, explains that IMC origi-\nnally started out as focused on creating “one voice, one look” marketing communication, but\ncompanies broadened that focus as they realized the need for greater consistency for all aspects\nof brand communication and customer relationships.17So the meaning of IMC has expanded be-\nyond traditional marketing communication and encompasses what we are calling in this book “to-\ntal brand communication.”\nIt might be helpful to consider how all of the communication we’ve been discussing fits to-\ngether.
