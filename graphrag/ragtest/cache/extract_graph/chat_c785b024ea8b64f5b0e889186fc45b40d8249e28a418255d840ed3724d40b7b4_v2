If an agency wants to buy space in all of the major news-\npapers in the West, for example, the agency’s buyer could contract with a media rep firm\nwhose sales rep and brokers handle national sales for all those newspapers. This allows the\nmedia buyer to place the buy with one order.\nOn the buying side, media planners, buyers, and researchers work primarily for agencies, al-\nthough they can also be found working for marketers who handle their own media work in house.\nTheir challenge is to determine the best way to deliver a message, which is called media plan-\nning.The job functions are as follows:\n• Media researcherscompile audience measurement data, media costs, and availability data\nfor the various media options being considered by the planners.\n• Media plannersdevelop the strategic decisions outlined in the media plan, such as where to\nadvertise geographically, when to advertise, and which type of media to use to reach specific\ntypes of audiences.\n• Media buyersimplement the media plan by contracting for specific amounts of time or\nspace. They spend the media budget according to the plan developed by the media planner.\nMedia buyers are expected to maintain good media supplier relations to facilitate a flow of\ninformation within the fast-changing media marketplace. This means there should be close\nworking relationships between planners and buyers, as well as media reps, so media plan-\nners can tap this source of media information to better forecast media changes, including\nprice and patterns of coverage.\n• Media buying companies,mentioned briefly in Chapter 1, are independent companies that\nspecialize in doing media research, planning, and buying. They may be a spin-off from the\nmedia department in an advertising agency, but because they are now independent compa-\nnies, they work for a variety of clients. They consolidate media buying to get maximum dis-\ncounts from the media for the volume of their buys. They then pass on some of this saving to\ntheir clients.\nWHAT ARE THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MEDIA STRATEGY?\nMedia placement is often the largest single cost item in a marketing communication budget,\nespecially for consumer goods and services. Procter & Gamble, for example, spent more than\n$2 billion on measured media in 2009, although for the first time P&G lost its leadership position\nas the top U.S. advertiser to Verizon, the telecom giant, which suffered less during the Great Re-\ncession than P&G.8Because of the huge amount of money spent on measured media, as well as\nnontraditional media, decisions about how the money is to be spent are carefully analyzed and\njustified in the media planning process.\nThe Media Plan\nThe challenge marketing communicators face is how to manage all of the media opportunities and\nPrinciple\nyet maximize the efficiency of budgets that are inevitably too small to do everything the firm\nThe goal of media\nplanning is to maximize would like to do to reach every current and potential customer. All of this decision making comes\nimpact while minimizing together in a media plan,which identifies the best media to use to deliver an advertising message\ncost. efficiently to a targeted audience. The goal is to balance message impact and cost—maximizing\nimpact while minimizing cost.\nThe media plan is a subsection within a marcom plan and has its own objectives, strategies, and\ntactics. It is also developed in tandem with message planning, the topic of Chapter 8. Figure 11.2\nshows these relationships, but this time with an emphasis on media planning.

You will need\nto be familiar with these terms to understand the review of media forms discussed in this chapter\nand the chapters that follow.\nMedia Mix In most cases a media plan will include more than one medium, and therefore is a\nmedia mix. This media mixis the way various types of media are strategically combined to cre-\nate a certain kind of impact. For example, the campaign that launched the iPod used posters and\nmagazine ads to create awareness of the new product, followed by television advertising that\nshowed how to use the product, and billboards that reminded people to look for it in stores.\nBecause of the breadth of IMC plans, the term multiplatform has become popular to de-\nscribemultichannelandmultimarketingcommunicationareas.Inotherwords,inIMCplansyou\nwillfind,inadditiontotraditionalmeasuredmediaadvertising,avarietyofothertoolsbeingused,\nsuchasevents,socialmedia(suchasFacebookandTwitter),brandedentertainment(suchasfilms\norvideogamesinwhichthebrandisthehero),productplacement,andguerillamarketing.\nTargetsandAudiences Oneofthebiggestchallengesindevelopingamediaplanismatch\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
