Long gone is the bright\nred and yellow accented\nmansard roof. In its place are\nsofter, subtler lines and fea-\ntures, bringing this fast-food\ngiant’s image in line with to-\nday’s discriminating consumer’s\npalette.\nWith the addition of a new de-\nsign and set of healthier food choices,\nMcDonald’s is updating its image from kiddy classic to a\ndestination for all ages. In the past few years, the com-\npany has achieved success both in updating its look and\nfeel and expanding its target market without losing core\ncustomers. How is this possible you might ask? BRAND\nEQUITY.\nWithout hesitation, most people in any country in\nthe world can recognize a McDonald’s sign instantly\nfrom a great distance. The Golden Arches are an icon,\nwith enormous brand equity attached. For more than\nfifty years the red and yellow color scheme has been a\nmainstay among the 30,000(cid:2)worldwide locations, and\nnot until recently has it strayed from this design.\nDue to its overwhelming worldwide presence\nthrough advertisements, endorsements, and other mar-\nketing venues, McDonald’s has built such a powerful\nbrand—and volume amount of brand equity—that it\ncould dramatically alter its environmental design with-\nout taking a hit to its market share. You, as the cus-\ntomer, inherently understand that the Big Mac is still the\nBig Mac; it’s just served now in a hipper, cooler location.\nBrand equity, it’s a powerful tool. Those who have it\nlove it. Those who don’t strive desperately to achieve it.\nWhen you walk into the new McDonald’s, you will\nimmediately notice plasma screen TVs, pendant lighting,\ncomfortable armchairs, and perhaps the boldest new\nfeature: WiFi Internet access. At first, you might even\nmistake the place for a Starbucks or even Panera Bread.\nThat’s part of the strategy, as McDonald’s is now focus-\nNote:Amy Niswonger is a graphic designer and professor who\ning on creating a specific type of customer experience,\nowns her own design studio.
