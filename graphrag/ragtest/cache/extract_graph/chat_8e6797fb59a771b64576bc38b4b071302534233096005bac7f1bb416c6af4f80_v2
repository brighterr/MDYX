That recall came\na week after McDonald’s recalled a Happy Meal “Scooter Bug” toy. In 1999 the fast-food indus-\ntry reeled from the deaths of two infants who suffocated from containers used in a Pokémon pro-\nmotion. About 25 million of those toys were recalled.\nCHAPTER 17 • PROMOTIONS 541\nLooking Ahead\nAs you’ve read in this chapter, promotions can successfully deliver sales to a company, but they\nmust be well planned and executed if they are to enhance the brand’s reputation. The next chap-\nter, which will wrap up our discussion of IMC, as well as introduce various specialized areas of\nmarketing communication, will also reinforce the idea that all the tools we have presented in this\nbook must work together to create a consistent and coherent brand image.\nIT’S A WRAP\nConsumers Vote\nFrontier the Winner\nSimilar to the “Flip to Mexico” campaign (described in the opening case in Chapter 8), Frontier’s “Denver’s\nFavorite Animal” campaign proved to be a winner. Fans engaged in the democratic process in a mock elec-\ntion, posting more than 4,000 entries on the forum and logging more than a million votes.\nRecognizing that all the candidates were male, more than 1,000 fans signed a petition to draft the only\nfemale animal, Foxy the Fox, into the race. Even the White House Project, an organization that supports\nwomen in politics, got into the act, creating its own “Draft Foxy” commercial and posting a story online urg-\ning people to vote for Foxy as Denver’s favorite animal.\nIn case you were wondering, the Penguins were announced the winners of the favorite animal contest in\na 60-second commercial that ran during the last half hour of the Academy Awards. Maybe they had a little\nbump in popularity from Happy Feet, a movie about penguins that won an Academy Award for Best Animated\nFeature Film that same night.\nFrontier won big, too. Web traffic was up more than 50 percent over the same period in the previous year.\nOnline bookings increased 18 percent. Another benefit—online enrollments in Frontier’s frequent flyer pro-\ngram increased by about a third. Throughout the campaign, the much-talked about campaign garnered an\nestimated value in ad equivalency dollars from exposure on TV news, newspaper stories, PR releases and\nevents, and social networking, proving that the characters were more popular than ever.\nFrontier’s advertising has been recognized with more than 80 awards. Frontier won a Gold Effie for sus-\ntained success. The advertising was nominated for Best of Show at the International Mobius Awards for two\nyears in a row. It was awarded a Silver Clio for the prestigious Content & Contact category and won a Silver\nEffie as well. A 2010 ad for a 43-hour super sale that ran during Super Bowl XLIII (43) also received top hon-\nors in the sustained success campaign category of the North American Effie Awards. “Denver’s Favorite Ani-\nmal” campaign received a nomination for a National Emmy for Outstanding Achievement in Advanced Media\nTechnology. It won further recognition, along with creators Couzens and Ennis when it was selected as one of\nthe “Amazing Animal Ads” aired on Animal Planet.\nKey Points Summary\n1.What are the current trends and practices in planning term bottom-line results; it’s accountable; sales promotion\npromotions?Sales promotion offers an “extra incentive” to is less expensive than advertising; it speaks to the current\ntake action.
