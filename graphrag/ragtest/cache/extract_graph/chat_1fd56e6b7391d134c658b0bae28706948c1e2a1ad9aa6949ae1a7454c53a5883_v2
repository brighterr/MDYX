These are generally conducted in two or more markets with the same\nnumber of similar markets chosen to act as controls. In the control markets the researcher can ei-\nther (1) run no advertising or (2) continue to run the old ad. The new advertising (or product vari-\nation) is used in the test cities. Before, during, and after running the advertising, marketers\ncompare sales results in the test cities. Some cities, such as Buffalo, Indianapolis, and San Anto-\nnio, are considered excellent test markets because their demographic and socioeconomic profiles\nare representative of either the United States or a particular target market. Furthermore, they are\nrelatively isolated as media markets so the advertising impact is less likely to be affected by what\nis happening in other markets.\nThe possibilities for isolating variables in test markets are almost limitless. Researchers can\nincrease the frequency of advertising or try a different media schedule, for example. They can see\nwhether an ad emphasizing brand convenience will stimulate sales to two-career families. They\ncan try an ad that plays up the brand’s fiber or vitamin content or compare the effectiveness of a\ntwo-for-one promotion versus a cents-off coupon.\nPost-Testing: After-Execution Research\nAnother evaluation method is post-testing, which occurs after the marketing communication\nhasbeenusedtodetermineifitmetitsobjectives.Themostcommonevaluativeresearchtech-\nniques account planners and advertising researchers use include memory tests, persuasion\ntests, direct-response counts, frame-by-frame tests, in-market tests such as test markets, and\nbrandtracking.\nSome of these more traditional post-testing methodologies were discussed in Chapter 6,\nhowever, there is another type called heuristicsthat is relevant for certain types of post-testing\nevaluation. Harley Manning, vice president for customer experience at Forrester Research, de-\nscribes heuristics as a type of expert review that Forrester uses to evaluate the performance of\nwebsites in terms of brand attributes (information provided) and user descriptions and goals as\nmeasured against “a valid set of rules (heuristics) that identify known types of user experience\nflaws.” Manning explains that Forrester uses that type of expert-review research to gauge how\nwell the sites served consumers (keep the brand promise).\nThe idea is that advertising—and other types of marketing communication messages—vary\nin the way they affect people, so the measurements also must be different.\nBreakthrough: Attention Most advertising is evaluated in terms of its ability to get and keep\nattention. This is a simple concept but difficult to measure. Similar to pretesting, some re-\nsearchers use instantaneous tracking in a theater setting where viewers with a keypad indicate\nwhat they watch and don’t watch—or rather what interests them and doesn’t interest them. The\nAmeritest methodology asks respondents who have just watched a collection of ads to indicate\nwhich ones interested them.10Another firm’s method asks viewers to rate how enjoyable the ad\nis, which confounds the attention score with a liking response. Other methodologies use noted\nscores for print ads or ask viewers to recognize the concept of a commercial and attach it to a\nbrand.\nEngagement Tests Interest in a commercial is determined by concentration and excitement. Eye-\ntrackingresearch is a mechanical technique that traces saccadic eye movement,the path the eye\nCHAPTER 19 • EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS 589\ntakes in scanning an ad. Because scanning involves a lot of\nstops and starts and revisits, this complex map of how a vi-\nsual is scanned identifies what first caught the viewer’s at-\ntention—the visual point of entry—and where it moved to\nnext. It also records those elements the eye kept revisiting\neither to focus on because they were appealing visuals or\nbecause they needed more study. It also shows what ele-\nments didn’t get noticed at all. The e-Motion system from\nthe New Jersey–based firm PreTesting Group identifies\neye fixations but also the amount of vibrations in the\nretina. The vibration is very minute, but it does indicate a\nlevel of excitement—the more the retina vibrates, the\nmore interested the viewer.11\nUnderstanding and Comprehension Tests These tests\nare used as part of the diagnostic effort, but it is particu-\nlarly important in post-testing to determine if consumers A beautifully done image for John West, a British beer, uses\nunderstood the message. Another comprehension prob- a simple photograph of the top of a can. It takes on new\nlem can emerge from creative strategies that are engaging, meaning when the can’s rings are associated with the rings\nin water from a fishing bobber. The question is do people\nbut ask consumers to puzzle out the meaning. Ambiguity\nget the association and understand the larger meaning\nis sometimes used particularly because it is engaging, but\nof “Relax with a Can of John West.”\nit can also be a risky strategy, one that benefits from test-\ning. An example is a billboard for a British beer brand\nJohn West, which is given a dramatic touch by making the rings on top of the can look like rings\nof rippling water cast from a fishing bobber.\nMemory Tests Memory tests are based on the assumption that an advertisement leaves a men-\ntal residue with the person who has been exposed to it; in other words, the audience has learned\nsomething. One way to measure an advertisement’s effectiveness, then, is to contact consumers\nwho saw the ad and find out what they remember. Memory tests fall into two major groups: recog-\nnition tests and recall tests.\nOne way to measure memory is to show the advertisement to people and ask them whether\nthey remember having\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
