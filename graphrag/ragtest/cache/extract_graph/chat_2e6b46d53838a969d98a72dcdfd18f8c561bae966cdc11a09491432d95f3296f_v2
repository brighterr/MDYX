(We’ll talk about conditioned learning in\nthe section on association.) Cognitive learningoccurs when a presentation of facts, infor-\nmation, and explanations leads to understanding. Consumers who are trying to find informa-\ntion about a product before they buy it are taking the cognitive learning route. This typically\napplies to large purchases, such as cars, computers, and major appliances. Learning is also a\npart of new product introductions—in recent years, we have had to learn to use computers,\nVCRs, the Internet, TiVo, and the iPod, and marketing communication is the key tool used\nby marketers to teach prospective customers about these products and product innovations.\n• ComprehensionComprehensionis the process by which people understand, make sense of\nthings, and acquire knowledge. Confusion,on the other hand, is the absence of understand-\ning and is usually the result of logic problems. For example, it’s difficult for consumers to\nunderstand why an outdoor board for the gas-guzzling Hummer would use a green market-\ning strategy. The headline “Thirst for adventure. Not gas” suggests a gas-efficient Hummer\nand the logic doesn’t follow from what people commonly know about this vehicle.\n• DifferentiationDifferentiationis the consumer’s ability to separate one brand from another\nin a product category. Distinguishing between competing brands is what happens when con-\nsumers understand the explanation of a competitive advantage. In a historic but still impor-\ntant study of effective television commercials, researchers concluded that one of the most\nimportant effectiveness factors is a brand-differentiating message.28\n• RecallWe mentioned earlier that recognition is a measure of perception and recall is a mea-\nsure of learning or understanding. When you recall the ad message, you not only remember\nseeing the ad and hopefully the brand, you also remember the copy points, or the informa-\ntion provided about the brand. To recall information presented in the ad, however, you must\nhave concentrated on it and thought about it either as the information was being presented or\nafterward. Thinking about it—similar to mentally rehearsing the key points—is a form of in-\nformation processing that helps anchor ideas in memory and makes recall easier.\nEven though this section is on cognitive processing, note that feeling and thinking work to-\ngether. Psychologist and advertising professor Esther Thorson and her colleagues have developed\nPrinciple the memory model of advertising to explain how commercials are stored in memory as traces that\nAdvertising creates brand contain bits and pieces of the commercial’s message, including the feelings elicited by the mes-\nmeaning through sage. Recall of any of those elements—especially feelings—can serve as a cue to activate mem-\nsymbolism and association. ory of the commercial.29\nThese meanings transform\na generic product into a\nThe Association Facet: Connect\nspecific brand with a\ndistinctive image and What do you think of when you see an ad for Nike, Viagra, or Mountain Dew? The things that\npersonality. come to your mind, such as athletes for Nike, older men for Viagra, and teenage guys having fun\nCHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 115\nfor Mountain Dew, are the brands’associations. Associationis the technique of communicating\nthrough symbolism. As such, it is the primary tool used in brand communication. It is the process\nof learning to make symbolic connections between a brand and desirable characteristics and qual-\nities, as well as people, situations, and lifestyles that cue the brand’s image and personality.\nYouseeassociationatworkinadvertisinginthepracticeoflinkingabrandwithapositive\nexperience,oralifestyle,suchasAxewithcoolyoungmenorCokewithamountaintopexperi-\nence.The idea is to associate the brand with things that resonate positively with the customer.\nIt’s a three-way process: the (1) brand relates to (2) a quality that (3) customers value. Brands\ntakeonsymbolicmeaningthroughthisassociationprocess.ProfessorIvanPreston,inhisasso-\nciation model of advertising, believes that you can explain how advertising works by under-\nstandingassociation.30\nFactors That Drive the Association Response The goal of association is to use symbolic con-\nnections to define the brand and make it distinctive. Brand linkagereflects the degree to which\nthe associations presented in the message, as well as the con-\nsumer’s interest, are connected to the brand. For example, an\nad for Bisquick HeartSmart mix shows a pancake in the shape\nof a heart. In this case, the brand name—Bisquick HeartS-\nmart—is easily associated with the product use—your heart\nand healthy pancakes. The association drivers we discuss here\nare symbolism, conditioned learning, and transformation:\n• SymbolismThrough association a brand takes on a\nsymbolic meaning,which means the brand stands for\ncertain qualities. It represents something, usually some-\nthing abstract. Bisquick’s pancakes shaped like hearts\nconvey the heart-healthy message symbolically. The\nPort of Vancouver B2B ads use symbolism to catch at-\ntention and tell a story, such as the vacancy sign in the\nad analyzed earlier. Symbolism is also used in the other\nads, where one refers to cargo handling as shepherding\nand the other references wind\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
