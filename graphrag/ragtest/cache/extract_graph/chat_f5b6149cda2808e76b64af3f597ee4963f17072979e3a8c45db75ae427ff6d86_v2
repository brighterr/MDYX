Amajor study by the Newspaper Association of America, for example,\nMedia planners match the\ntarget audience with the grouped media audiences into four useful categories by generation: traditionalists (born before\naudience of a particular 1946), baby boomers (born 1946–1964), Gen X (1965–1976), and Gen Y(1977–1994).9 Since\nmedium. this study, Millenials (born in the late 1990s into the first decade of 2000) have been commonly\nadded to the list of media audiences categorized by generation. Dramatic differences are seen in\nthe media experiences of these audience groups:\n• Traditionalistsgrew up with newspapers, magazines, and radio. (Note:No television; no\ncell phone, computers, or Internet.)\n• Boomers,who are in their 50s and 60s, always had those three types of media, but also grew\nup with television (but still no cell phones, computers, or Internet).\n• Gen Xers,who are now in their 30s and 40s, grew up not only with the media of the preced-\ning generations, but also with tape recorders, Walkman portable radios, video games, VCRs,\nand cable TV(still no cell phones, computers, or Internet).\n• Gen Yers,who are twenty-somethings, had all the above media, but also grew up with the\ncomputer, as well as satellite TV, the Internet, CDs, and cell phones. (Note:Now, finally, we\nhave a generation that grew up with computers and cell phones.)\n• Millennials,the most recent generation, have grown up with DVDs, TiVo, satellite radio,\niPods, smart phones, Second Life, and more recently they have witnessed the introduction of\nMySpace, Facebook, and Twitter.\nThemediaplanners’challengeistoknowwhichmediabestreachwhichaudiences,whatever\ntheirages.Inaclassicexampleoftargeting,themarketforthelaunchoftheiPod,forexample,was\natechnologicallysophisticatedyoungadult.Thetargetmarketalsoneededtohaveenoughdiscre-\ntionaryincometobuytheproduct.Thataudienceprofileledinitiallytoatargetofinnovators,peo-\nplewhoareintocoolgadgetsandwholovemusic.Nowwheredoyoufindthosepeople?Oneplace\ntostartwaswithpostersinsubwaysandotherurbansites.Thecampaignalsousedoutdoorboards,\nprintmedia,andTVcommercialsinwaysthatwouldgeneratebuzz.Akeystrategywastogetpeo-\npletalkingaboutthisnewgadget.Eventuallythepricedroppedandthemarketwidenedtoinclude\nbothcollegeandhighschoolstudentsaftertheinitiallaunch.\nCHAPTER 11 • MEDIA BASICS 335\nThe Basis for the Buy\nDecisions about which media to use are based on the profile of the audience that reads, views, lis-\ntens, or visits a medium. Media sales reps provide their own data, but research by account plan-\nners also uncovers media use patterns that help make these decisions.\nMedia planners use a variety of terms to identify and measure audiences. The terms are easy\nto confuse, so let’s explain some here before we begin talking about specific characteristics of tra-\nditional media forms in the following chapters.\n• ExposureMedia effects all begin with exposure.We know from the discussion in Chapter 4\nPrinciple\nthat the first step in making an impact is perception—you have to be exposed to a message\nExposure doesn’t equate\nbefore any other effect is possible.
