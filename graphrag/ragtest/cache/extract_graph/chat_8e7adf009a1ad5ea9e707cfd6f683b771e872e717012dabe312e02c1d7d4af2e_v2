According to Parry Aftab, a lawyer specializing in computer-related issues,\n“It used to be that you could control the information because you’d have one spokesman who rep-\nresented the company. Now where you have thousands of employees who have access to an e-mail\nsite, you have thousands of spokesmen.”40All employees have “an inside view” of their company,\nwhether sanctioned by the PR department or not.\nGossip and rumors can spread around the world within hours. Angry customers and dis-\ngruntled former employees know this and have used the Internet to voice their complaints. A\nnumber of these people have set up websites, such as the Official Internet AntiNike website,\nalt.destroy.microsft,I Hate McDonald’s, Toys R Us Sucks, GTE Sucks, Why America Online\nSucks, Packard Bell Is Evil, and BallySucks. As a defense against this negative press,\nsome companies are registering domain names that might cause them trouble. For example,\nJP Morgan Chase bank owns IHateChase.com, ChaseStinks.com, and ChaseSucks.com, but\nnotchasebanksucks.com, which is an active website critical of the company.\nWhen Motrin posted an online ad on a Saturday about mothers who carried their babies in\nslings suggesting that this fashion caused back pain, outraged mommy-bloggers and Twitterers\nwasted no time calling for boycotts. Makers of Motrin responded by the end of the weekend with\nan apology and removed the ad.41\nSome companies monitor the Internet to see what is being said about them so they can re-\nspond to protect their reputations. Thousands of companies have hired eWatch, a firm that pro-\nvides Web monitoring services, to collect such information.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nAs you’ve seen throughout this chapter, businesses and organizations have many ways to reach\ntheir publics. It’s critical to find a way to break through the media clutter for public relations as\nwell as advertising messages. Some tips from an article42about how small businesses can com-\nmunicate their messages effectively include:\n• Wrap Your Story Around a Bigger IdeaFind a broader context or news hook for your prod-\nuct or service and show how your company fits into it.\n• Keep It Short and PersonalWhen reaching out to journalists, a few quick sentences via\ne-mail,free from industry jargon, explaining who you are and what your business is usually\nwill suffice. Try to keep the first e-mail readable without having to scroll down. Also, refer-\nring to past works by journalists shows you understand their area of coverage.\n• Pay Attention to Web BasicsBuilding a website and getting good rankings on search engines\nsuch as Yahoo! and Google can help customers find businesses, especially new ones. Con-\nsider blogging as a way to tell your story and interact with the public. Using sites such as\ntechnorati.comcan help turn up other like-minded bloggers. Podcasting and online video-\nsharing sites such as YouTube.comcan help tell your story, but do it creatively, avoiding\npurely commercial pitches.\n• Host EventsThese don’t have to be expensive, but small themed events with food and drink\nfor customers can be a good draw, particularly on streets crowded with multiple merchants.\n• SeekOutBrandAmbassadorsFindcustomerswillingtotalkupyourproducttoothers,anden-\ncouragetheirword-of-mouthmarketingwithdiscountsorfirstlooksatnewproductsandsales.\n• Publish a NewsletterIt sounds old fashioned, but with so much information coming to peo-\nple online these days, a mailed paper newsletter to customers can seem more personal than\nmass e-mails and help your business stand out.\nWhy Measure Public Relations Results?\nAs in all marketing communication areas, public relations evaluation is based on setting measur-\nable objectives from the beginning of planning.
