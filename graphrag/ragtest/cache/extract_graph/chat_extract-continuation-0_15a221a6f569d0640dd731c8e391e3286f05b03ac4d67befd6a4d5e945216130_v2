But how do you talk about the\nvarious strategic approaches you might consider? In other words, how do you put strategies into words?\nThe Strategic Approach\nFirst let’s review some simple ways to express a strategic approach—head or heart and hard or\nsoft sell. Then we’ll look at some more complex models that get a little deeper into the com-\nplexities of message strategy.\nHead and Heart In the Facets Model the cognitive objectives generally speak to the head, and\nthe affective objectives are more likely to speak to the heart. Sometimes, however, a strategy is\ndesigned to inform the mind as it touches the emotions. For example, in a strategy statement for\nVolkswagen’s “Drivers Wanted” campaign, the agency identified both rational and emotional di-\nmensions to the VWbrand:\nVW’s rational brand essence:\n“The only brand offering the benefits and ‘feeling’of German engineering within reach.”\nVW’s emotional brand essence:\n• Exciting\n• Different driving feeling\n• Different way of living\n• More feeling,fun,alive,connected.\nAnotherwaytorefertoheadandheartstrategiesarehard-andsoft-sellapproaches.Ahard\nsellisaninformationalmessagethatisdesignedtotouchthemindandcreatearesponsebasedon\nlogic.Theassumptionisthatthetargetaudiencewantsinformationandwillmakearationalprod-\nuctdecision.Asoftsellusesemotionalappealsorimagestocreatearesponsebasedonattitudes,\nmoods,andfeelings.Theassumptionwithsoft-sellstrategiesisthatthetargetaudiencehaslittle\ninterestinaninformationsearchandwillrespondmorefavorablytoamessagethattouchestheir\nemotionsorpresentsanattractivebrandimage.Asoft-sellstrategycanbeusedforhardproducts.\nNAPAauto parts ran an emotional ad that showed a dog sitting at a railroad crossing, forcing a\ntrucktobrakehardtoavoidhittinghimasatrainbearsdownonthescene.Thesloganputsthe\nheart-stoppingvisualstoryintoperspective:“NAPA,becausetherearenounimportantparts.”\nBut there are also examples of ads designed to stir emotions that didn’t work because they\nwere too manipulative or raised inappropriate emotions—think sexy calendars for car parts. It is\npossible to manipulate emotions in a way that viewers and listeners resent. For example, a bill-\nboard for a pest control company located in the heart of downtown that depicted a huge scary bug\nlooming over the sidewalk elicited many complaints from pedestrians as well as drivers.\nSometimes, however, high emotion works.

But these are simple concepts, and creative strategy is more com-\nplex. We’ll look at two of approaches that address other aspects of advertising strategy: Frazer’s\nsix creative strategies and Taylor’s strategy wheel.\nUniversityofWashingtonProfessorCharlesFrazerproposedasetofsixcreativestrategiesthat\naddressvarioustypesofmessagesituations.9Althoughnotcomprehensive,thesetermsareusefulto\nidentifysomecommonapproachestomessagestrategy.Thestrategiesaredescribedasfollows:\nFrazer’s Six Creative Strategies\nStrategy Description Uses\nPreemptive Uses a common attribute or Used for categories with little\nbenefit, but brand gets there differentiation or new product\nfirst—forces competition into categories.\n“me too” positions.\nUnique selling Uses a distinct difference in Used for categories with high levels\nproposition attributes that creates a of technological improvement and\nmeaningful consumer benefit. innovations.\nBrand image Uses a claim of superiority or Used with homogeneous, low-tech\ndistinction based on extr\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VOLKSWAGEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Volkswagen is a global automotive company known for its \"Drivers Wanted\" campaign, which emphasizes both rational and emotional brand essences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NAPA is an auto parts company that uses emotional advertising strategies, such as the ad featuring a dog at a railroad crossing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COW<|>EVENT<|>COW is a 30-minute public service announcement designed to teach Welsh schoolchildren about the dangers of texting while driving, featuring a strong fear appeal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASSIE COWAN<|>PERSON<|>Cassie Cowan is a fictional character in the COW public service announcement, depicted as a driver who causes a fatal accident due to texting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GWENT<|>GEO<|>Gwent is a region in Wales where the COW public service announcement is set, focusing on road safety)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Washington is an educational institution where Professor Charles Frazer proposed a set of six creative strategies for advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARLES FRAZER<|>PERSON<|>Charles Frazer is a professor at the University of Washington known for proposing six creative strategies for advertising)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOLKSWAGEN<|>NAPA<|>Both Volkswagen and NAPA use emotional appeals in their advertising strategies<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COW<|>CASSIE COWAN<|>Cassie Cowan is the main character in the COW public service announcement<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COW<|>GWENT<|>The COW public service announcement is set in Gwent, Wales<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON<|>CHARLES FRAZER<|>Charles Frazer is a professor at the University of Washington<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
