Where Coke had big brand presence, such as with NASCAR,\nthe NCAA, and Fantasy Football, there too went Coke Zero. And why there?\n189\n190 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nThe creative strategy was based on the self-deprecating humor you recognize\nfrom The Daily ShowandThe Office. The gist of the big idea was that the legal de-\npartment from Coca-Cola wanted to sue Coke Zero for taste infringement. The\ncompany made fun of itself proposing imaginary lawsuits and provided a non-\ntraditional campaign for Coke Zero. In one commercial, an unsuspecting real attor-\nney warns actors portraying Coke Classic executives not to sue Coke Zero, lest the\nsuit be dismissed and they be utterly humiliated.\nSo where you might expect to see a Coke message, you might also see the\nlawyers ranting about Coke Zero stealing its taste. Here’s a fun example. At the\nNCAA Final Four event in San Antonio, passersby could see a “Stop Coke Zero”\nrally and sample the taste similarity, providing an opportunity to prove to the\ntargeted males that Coke Zero really did taste like Coke. CP(cid:2)B even created an\nadvergame, called Rooftop Racer. The object of this NASCAR game was to invite\nplayers to step into a virtual car and race with other fellow drivers to the finish line\nwhile balancing a Coke Zero bottle on top of their car. Visitors to the CokeZero.com\nsite could “Sue a Friend.”\nThis campaign signifies a shift in thinking about media strategy for Coca-Cola\nproducts, according to Katie Bayne, senior vice president for Coco-Cola brands in\nNorth America at Coca-Cola in Atlanta. “It’s not just about a television spot,” she\nsaid. That is especially true for Coke Zero as we look at where we need to be to\nconnect with the target audience. So what lesson do we learn from Coke Zero?\nSometimes you’ve got to take calculated risks, and sometimes they pay off, espe-\ncially when you use well-conceived message and media strategies to connect with\na carefully targeted audience.\nTo see more of this campaign, check out the Coke Zero website, www.cokezero\n.com. To see how well this oddball campaign connected with young males, turn to\nthe end of this chapter and read the It’s a Wrapfeature.\nSources:“Coke/Coke Zero Taste Similarity,” Effie Awards Brief of Effectiveness, www.nyama.org;Stuart Elliott, “Can’t Tell\nYour Cokes Apart?

In most\ncases, there is no one completely right way to do anything in advertising, but if you understand\nhow advertising works, you may be able to identify the best strategy to accomplish the objectives.\nThis chapter explains the concept of strategic planning as it is used in business, marketing, and\nadvertising and integrated marketing communication (IMC) plans. It covers key planning deci-\nsions, such as identifying critical problems and opportunities, targeting the right audience, posi-\ntioning or repositioning the brand against the competition, and making implementation decisions.\nIt also introduces the concept of account planning and explains its critical role in determining the\nconsumer insights that lead to message and media strategies.\nWHAT IS STRATEGIC PLANNING?\nFor marketing communication, strategic planning is the process of identifying a problem that\ncan be solved with marketing communication, then determining objectives(what you want to ac-\ncomplish), deciding on strategies (how to accomplish the objectives), and implementing the\ntactics (actions that make the plan come to life). This process occurs within a specified time\nframe. Objectives are usually long-term propositions, strategies are more medium term in focus,\nand tactics are more short term.\nCHAPTER 7 • STRATEGIC PLANNING 191\nEven those experienced in advertising sometimes have a hard time telling the difference be-\ntween an objective and a strategy. Remember, an objectiveis a goal to be accomplished; in ad-\nvertising, objectives are determined by the effects you want to achieve. Astrategyis the means,\nthe design or plan, by which the objective is accomplished—the advertising message and media\nstrategies, for example. In advertising, tactics are the way the ads and other marketing\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
