The results from Internet sweepstakes, contests,\nand games can be huge because of the multiplier effect of interaction and social media.\n• SpecialtiesSpecialty advertisingpresents the brand’s name on something that is given\naway in an attempt to remind consumers about the brand. Items include calendars, pens and\npencils, T-shirts, mouse pads, tote bags, and water bottles. The ideal specialty item is one\nthat is kept out in the open where other people can see it, such as a coffee mug.\nPromotional Media The types of sales promotions we just listed can be delivered in various me-\ndia, including print, broadcast, and online. Direct mail has dominated the delivery of special pro-\nmotions but much of that has moved online. The Internet in particular is useful for distributing\ncoupons, inviting participation in games and sweepstakes, and even in sampling.\nFrontier Airlines’favorite animal contest used the Internet effectively to increase Web traffic\nwith the goal of increasing the online purchase of flights. Advertisers can use the Internet for sales\npromotion programs in a number of ways, including sampling, sweepstakes and contests, price\ndeals, and coupons. The “Bunny” promo for\nFrontier was delivered to Frontier’s EarlyReturns\nmembers by e-mail.\nInternet promotion is one of the hot areas\nof sales promotions. Many advertising cam-\npaigns include a campaign-dedicated website,\nsuch as the “microsite” designed as a tie-in. The\nCheetos campaign described in Chapter 6, for\nexample, was supported with an online website,\nOrangeunderground.com, that displayed the\nwork of a social network of practical jokers com-\nmitting Random Acts of Cheetos—in other\nwords, using Cheetos to turn things orange.\nThis is an example of an e-mail price promotion sent to Frontier’s Some sites offer price promotions only to\nfrequent flyers. Even though it’s promoting a sale price, it’s still faithful online purchasers. The promotions might be\nto the Frontier image and “different kind of animal” campaign theme. discounted prices, rebates, or free offers such as\nCHAPTER 17 • PROMOTIONS 525\nfrequent flyer miles. Incentive programs offered by online marketers FreeRide Media\n(www.freeride.com), MotivationNet (www.mypoints.com), and Netcentives (www.clickrewards\n.com) offer discounts to customers who enroll with them before buying from other merchants.\nCoupons can be delivered via the Internet. Several sites have been designed for this.\nCatalina’s ValuePage Web site (www.valupage.com) allows users to print coupons they can use at\n7,000 supermarkets. The coupon is printed with a barcode and is used with the shopper’s store\ncard. If a product were to offer coupons this way, the site could link the shopper’s Internet infor-\nmation with store card information, which the brand manager could use in determining the ef-\nfectiveness of the coupon strategy.\nPromotional Campaigns Special promotions are usually approached as a campaign because\nthey involve a variety of media and reach many stakeholders; they also have a limited time frame.\nPromotional planners are continually looking for new ways to engage consumers. In particular,\nthe Internet has opened up new opportunities, with viral media driving a high level of social in-\nteraction that reinforces the involvement dimension of promotions. The KitKat promotion dis-\ncussed earlier is an example of an innovative use of social media for a promotional idea.\nAn example of a full-blown promotional campaign is the effort that accompanies the open-\ning of a big budget movie, as described in The Inside Storyfeature on the following page.\nHow Are Consumer Promotions Used?\nAlthough an action response is the goal of most sales promotions, some programs such as the\nFrontier Airlines campaign are designed to build awareness first, but always with action as the ul-\ntimate goal. Consumers get to choose the animal they like best to represent Frontier, but in the\nlong run the airline wants consumers to book flights online. What better way to get them to the\nsite than generating Web traffic via an entertaining contest?\nTo demonstrate the strategy behind the use of these promotional tools in a new product\nlaunch, let’s suppose we are introducing a new corn chip named King Corn. Promotion is partic-\nularly useful to launch the corn chip because it has a number of tools designed to encourage trial,\nbut it can also be used later in the brand’s life to maintain or increase its share of market and to\nremind and reward loyal customers. Promotions, in other words, deliver on a number of our\nFacets of Effects and drive a specific set of objectives.\nAwareness Our first challenge is to create awareness of this brand, which is the real strength of\nadvertising and, you may remember from Chapter 5, the first step in consumer decision making.\nHowever, sometimes awareness can be increased when advertising is combined with an appro-\npriate promotion to call attention to the brand name to get people to try the product. Awareness-\nbuilding promotion ideas for this new corn chip might include colorful point-of-purchase\ndisplays, sponsorship of a King Corn team, or a special event that will attract people in the target\nmarket.\nTrial Creating awareness will only take the product so far, however. Consumers must also per-\nceive King Corn as offering some clear benefit compared to the competition. Sales promotion\ndoes this by arranging for experiences, such as special events where people can try the product or\nsee it demonstrated. Trial is one of the most important objectives of promotion, but it is essential\nto get the right people, the targeted audience, involved with the product. Sales promotion has\nother tools that lead to trial, such as sampling. An effective way to get people to try King\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FRONTIER AIRLINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Frontier Airlines is an airline company that uses internet-based promotions to increase web traffic and online flight purchases)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EARLYRETURNS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EarlyReturns is a membership program by Frontier Airlines that offers promotions to its members)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEETOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cheetos is a snack brand that used an online website, Orangeunderground.com, for a promotional campaign involving social network activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREERIDE MEDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FreeRide Media is an online marketing company offering discounts to customers who enroll before buying from other merchants)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTIVATIONNET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MotivationNet is an online marketing company offering discounts to customers who enroll before buying from other merchants)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETCENTIVES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Netcentives is an online marketing company offering discounts to customers who enroll before buying from other merchants)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CATALINA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Catalina is a company that operates the ValuePage website, allowing users to print coupons for use at supermarkets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VALUEPAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ValuePage is a website operated by Catalina that allows users to print coupons for use at supermarkets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING CORN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>King Corn is a new corn chip brand that uses promotional tools to encourage trial and maintain market share)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRONTIER AIRLINES<|>EARLYRETURNS<|>EarlyReturns is a membership program by Frontier Airlines offering promotions to its members<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRONTIER AIRLINES<|>CHEETOS<|>Both Frontier Airlines and Cheetos use internet-based promotional campaigns to engage consumers<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREERIDE MEDIA<|>MOTIVATIONNET<|>Both FreeRide Media and MotivationNet offer discounts to customers who enroll before buying from other merchants<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREERIDE MEDIA<|>NETCENTIVES<|>Both FreeRide Media and Netcentives offer discounts to customers who enroll before buying from other merchants<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOTIVATIONNET<|>NETCENTIVES<|>Both MotivationNet and Netcentives offer discounts to customers who enroll before buying from other merchants<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATALINA<|>VALUEPAGE<|>ValuePage is a website operated by Catalina that allows users to print coupons for use at supermarkets<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
