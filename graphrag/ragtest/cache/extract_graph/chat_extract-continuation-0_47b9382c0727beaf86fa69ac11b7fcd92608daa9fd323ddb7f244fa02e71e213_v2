They will provide the oppor-\ntunity for long-form messaging. Recommend use of local magazines as well as regional editions of national maga-\nzines to provide reach.\nRadio:Close to50% of active health managers listen to the radio everyday; and 50% always listen when they’re in their\ncar; they rely on radio to keep them informed. But, they tend to change the station when commercials come on. Thus,\nwe need to use radio in a non-traditional manner. Recommended using 1–2 top-reaching stations per market and\nestablish relationships with key DJs. Bring them to the Center’s pre-opening to experience the staff, the atmosphere,\nand expose them to the services so that they will then talk about the Center during their shows. This will\nallow women to hear from a trusted source, yet via a good reaching medium, while not immediately turning the dial.\nOut-of-Home: Use traditional billboards and transit advertising to intersect women during their daily routine. Helps\ncreate a surround-sound approach.\nPlace-Based: Based on their daily routines and behaviors, we recommended placements in Health Clubs, Coffee\nShops, Grocery Stores, and Mall/Retail Centers. The messaging would need to be specially tailored to these en-\nvironments and placements.\nInternet:\n• Other websites: Determine key sites within each city and talk with top-rated health sites nationally to gain a\npresence—particularly contextually via articles. Research blogs and chat rooms to determine other electronic\navenues for contact.\n• Social media: Use social networking technologies like Twitter to push out news about the doctors and other\nspecialists working in the programs, information on events .\n•WHSP website: Develop a website that will provide resources and links for women including the opportunity for\ncommunity such as: blogging, chat rooms, message boards, as well as a feedback and research tool. Aggregate\ncontent that affects all women, but be specific when it comes to each community to ensure the local flavor and\nexpertise. Also recognize that women will need to be pulled into the site via news, information—important to\nfirst go where they are first.\n• Hospital websites: Tie into the partner hospital websites to create a special women’s corner that links to the\nWHSP site.\nEvents/Seminars:Invite women in each community to a grand opening celebration with 2–3 key speakers. Follow up with\nquarterly seminars, which will encourage women to spread the word—“bring your sister or your mom.” Developa\nmembership program that will provide an opportunity for Brand Ambassadors, creating a women’s health care\n“community.”\n• KeyMediaStrategiesIdentifyingtheappropriatemediainvolvedlocatingthoseapertures\nwheremessagesabouttheWHSPwouldbemostwelcome.Thatinvolvesunderstandingthe\npatternsinthetargetaudiences’livesandtheintersectionoftheiractivitieswithmediaop-\nportunities.Anotherimportantaspectofmediastrategyisspellingoutthemediamix,which\nincludesthevariousmediatobeusedandstrategiesthatdrivehowtheysupportandrein-\nforceoneanother.FortheWHSP,thekeydecisionwastousebothtraditionalmediaand\nnontraditionalvehiclesthatarespecifictotheirlivesandpersonalactivities.Thekey\nstrategicdecisionsinthismediaplancanbesummarizedaswho,where,when,how\nmuch,andwhat.\n444 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nWHAT IS THE BIG PICTURE OF MEDIA PLANNING?\nAs we have noted previously, when most people think about media, they think about traditional\nmass media and advertising. Media planning in an IMC context is complicated by the ways me-\ndia interact in integrated programs. We’ll discuss two of these practices that add complexity to\nthe process: IMC planning and global media planning.\nIMC and Contact Point Planning\nWhen IMC planners think about media, they think about message delivery systems and that in-\ncludes all of the media used in various types of marketing communication. Direct response, for\nexample, which is the topic of Chapter 16, can appear in traditional media (print with fill-in-\nblanks to get more information about a brand or place an order; infomercials on TV), but also in\nletters mailed directly to the home or office, telemarketing (phone calls to the home or office),\nand in digital forms, such as e-mail and Twitter. Public relations places stories in all of the tradi-\ntional media including trade media, but also uses publicity tours, speeches and interviews with\nexecutives, special events, corporate videos, blogs, and websites, to name a few.\nAs DePaul University marketing professor Steve Kelly says, “Because the Internet allows\nmarketers to make their marketing dollars measurable and accountable, much like the direct mar-\nketers have done for years, the goal now is to make all marketing communications measurable.\nThus, integrated marketing communications becomes the goal.” He explains, “IMC tries to tie it\nall together. IMC is the goal of most marketers, but multichannel is what they actually do.”10\nAn example of IMC multimedia planning comes from The Today Show, which launched a\nnew recipe website and mobile application in sponsorship with Unilever. The “Cooking School”\nwebsite contains previously aired segments of “Today’s Kitchen” and streaming video webisodes,\nas well as recipes, cooking tips, and promotions for Unilever brands such as Bert\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WHSP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Women's Health Services Program (WHSP) is an initiative focused on providing health resources and community engagement for women through various media and events)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEVE KELLY<|>PERSON<|>Steve Kelly is a marketing professor at DePaul University who discusses the importance of integrated marketing communications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPAUL UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DePaul University is an educational institution where Steve Kelly teaches marketing)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEVE KELLY<|>DEPAUL UNIVERSITY<|>Steve Kelly is a marketing professor at DePaul University<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHSP<|>STEVE KELLY<|>Steve Kelly's insights on integrated marketing communications are relevant to WHSP's media strategy<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
