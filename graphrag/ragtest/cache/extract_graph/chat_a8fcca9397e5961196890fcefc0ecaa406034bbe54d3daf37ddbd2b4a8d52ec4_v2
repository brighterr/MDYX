But, in truth, traditional media hardly exist any more. An interview on\npublic radio’s NPR headlined, “In a 24/7 World, What Is a Magazine?” began with this line: “It’s\nhard to know what a magazine is these days.” Is it paper? Is it a website? Martin Sorrell, head of\nWPP, the world’s largest communication company (125 firms including Ogilvy & Mather and\nJWTadvertising agencies) asks: “How do you define a newspaper or a magazine?” He observes,\n“I doubt free-to-air television or, in particular, newspapers and magazines, will ever be the same\nagain.”41This is one of the key points of change that Kelley pointed out in his essay in the Part 4\nopener. He observes that all media, including the traditional ones, will have some type of digital\nand interactive component and this will only make media selection more challenging.\nNot only are these traditional media formats changing, so are the ads that appear in them.\nCBS promoted its fall season with ads in the magazine Entertainment Weeklythat contained video\nclips of its new programs. Similar to musical greeting cards, the technology used a flexible, thin,\nplastic screen that was activated when the two-page ad was opened. The videos also included a\nPepsi Max ad inside the CBS ad. An executive at Time Warner, publisher of EW, observed, “It we\ncan efficiently put video into magazines, think about the possibilities it would open up.”42\nSo let’s move on to the exciting and equally fast-changing world of digital media, which are\ngenerating even more new opportunities for marketing communication. The next chapter will re-\nview the dynamic world of online communication.\nIT’S A WRAP\nAflac’s Duck\nSpreads Its Wings\nHow effective is the Aflac duck? The Kaplan Thaler Group succeeded in creating a campaign that led to a\n94 percent awareness of Aflac and an increase of 55 percent in U.S. sales during the first three years\nof the campaign, followed by double-digit growth in the following years. This campaign earned a Gold Effie\nfor the duck who successfully communicated the brand personality as well as the honor of being voted one\nof the best-known brand icons.\nWill the next generation of this ad campaign be as effective as a new agency uses the duck to challenge\nconsumers to find out more about the company? Stay tuned.\nIn the meantime, you can learn much from these campaigns featuring the celebrated odd duck. This case\ndemonstrates that even in a changing media environment that puts much emphasis on the Web and social\nmedia, traditional media are often critical to a campaign’s effectiveness. Traditional media helped drive con-\nsumers to Aflac’s website. All components of the campaign worked together to educate consumers about the\nbrand, to increase brand comprehension, and have a little fun.\nCHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 385\nAlso, you can learn that even as campaigns evolve, it’s important to stay true to the brand. According to\nJames Wisdom, senior manager of new media for Aflac, the message in social media, like that in the tradi-\ntional media, has to “straddle a fine line between lighthearted quips and corporate messaging.”\nWisdom said, “We work very hard to stay true to the Aflac Duck as he has been defined in the past, while\ndefining his personality going forward.”\nAs the campaign takes flight, watch as our fine-feathered friend continues to show his plucky, rock star\npersonality and build his vocabulary beyond the one word he knows best, “Aflac.”\nKey Points Summary\n1.What key points should marketers know to make effec- also include public radio, cable and satellite radio, low-\ntive decisions about advertising in newspapers and mag- powered stations, and Web radio.
