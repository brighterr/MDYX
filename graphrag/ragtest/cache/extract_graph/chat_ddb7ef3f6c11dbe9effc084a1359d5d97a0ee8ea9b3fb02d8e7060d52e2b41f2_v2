The commercial starts softly with an average Joe character disasso-\nciating himself from Canadian stereotypes. As he talks, he builds up intensity and at the end, he’s\nin a full-blown rant ending with the line “My name is Joe,and I am Canadian”at the top of his\nvoice. The commercial was so successful it was played at events all around the country.\nHumor is a type of writing that copywriters use to create entertaining, funny ads. The idea\nis that, if the humor works, the funny copy will lend a positive aura to a brand. It’s particularly\nimportant to master funny writing if you are trying to reach an audience that’s put off by con-\nventional advertising, such as young males.
