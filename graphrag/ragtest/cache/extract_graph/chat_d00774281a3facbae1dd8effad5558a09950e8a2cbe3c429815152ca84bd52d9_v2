Advertising claims are considered to be unethical if they are false,\nPrinciple\nmisleading, or deceptive. In the drive to find something to say about a product that will catch attention\nAdvertising claims are\nand motivate the audience to respond, advertisers sometimes stretch the truth. False advertising, unethical if they are false,\nwhich is a type of misleading advertising, is simply a message that is untrue. Misleading claims, misleading, or deceptive.\npuffery, comparative advertising, endorsements, and product demonstrations are explained next.\nMisleading Claims and Puffery The target of the heaviest criticism for being misleading is\nweight-lossadvertising,aswellasotherback-of-the-magazine,self-improvementadvertisements\nforhealthandfitnessproducts.Inastudyof300weight-lossads,theFederalTradeCommission\n(FTC),aregulatorybody,foundthatadsforweight-lossproductssometimesmake“grosslyex-\naggerated”claimsandthatdietersneedtobewareofadsfordietarysupplements,mealreplace-\nments,patches,creams,wraps,andotherproducts.(TheFTCisdescribedmorecompletelyinthe\nregulationsection.)Thestudyfoundthat40percentoftheadsmadeatleastonerepresentation\nthatwasalmostcertainlyfalse,and55percentmadeaclaimthatwasverylikelyfalseoratleast\nlackedadequatesubstantiation.14\nMisleading claims are not just a problem in the United States. The London-based Barclays\ncredit card was forced by the U.K. government to withdraw an advertising campaign that prom-\nised “0 percent forever.” The ad was deemed deceptive because borrowers would enjoy the no-\ninterest offer for only as long as it took for the balance to be cleared. In other words, all new\nspending on the card would be charged the standard interest rate.15 Principle\nNot all exaggerated claims are considered misleading. Pufferyis defined as “advertising or Puffery may be legal, but\nother sales representations, which praise the item to be sold with subjective opinions, superla- if it turns off the target\ntives, or exaggerations, vaguely and generally, stating no specific facts.”16Campbell Soup, for ex- audience nothing is\nample, has used the slogan “M’m!, M’m!, Good!” which is vague and can’t really be proven or gained by using such a\ndisproven. It’s a classic example of puffery, generally deemed to be of little concern to regulators strategy.\nlooking for false or misleading claims because it is so innocuous.\nBecause obviously exaggerated “puffing” claims are legal, the question of puffery is mainly\nan ethical one. According to the courts, consumers expect exaggerations and inflated claims in\nadvertising, so reasonable people wouldn’t believe that these statements (“puffs”) are literal facts.\nHowever, empirical evidence on the effectiveness of puffery is mixed. Some research suggests\nthat the public might expect advertisers to be able to prove the truth of superlative claims, and\nother research indicates that reasonable people do not believe such claims. This is particularly im-\nportant when advertising to children who might not know the difference between fact and opin-\nion. Noted advertising scholar Ivan Preston does not think all puffs deserve to be protected legally\nas he explains in the A Matter of Principlefeature that follows.\nComparative Advertising We’re used to seeing advertisers take on their competition in an\nad—Mac vs. PC, Dunkin’Donuts vs. Starbucks, Campbell’s Soup vs. Progresso. Although\nit is perfectly legitimate to compare a marketer’s product\nfavorably against a competitor, regulations govern the\nuseofcomparativeadvertisingifitcanbechallengedas\nmisleading.\nAdvertisersfacethecommonthreatthatcompetitorswill\nmisrepresenttheirproducts.Althoughnooneexpectsacom-\npetitortobetotallyobjective,advertisershavelegalrecourse\nto object to unfair comparisons. U.S. law permits awards of\ndamages from an advertiser who “misrepresents the nature,\ncharacteristics,qualities,orgeographicoriginincomparative\nadvertising.” Recently, a New York court granted Weight\nWatchers International a temporary restraining order against\nJennyCraig,claimingthatJennyCraig’sadvertisingmadede-\nceptiveclaimsaboutitssuccessrate.17\nAdvertisers who engage in comparative advertising\nknow that research in support of their competitive claims must\nbe impeccable. The Dunkin’Donuts ad compares its coffee to Dunkin’ Donuts hopes to convince coffee drinkers to switch\nStarbucks and backs up its claim with a national taste test. from Starbucks based on results from a national taste test.\n72 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nA MATTER OF PRINCIPLE\nPreston on Puffery\nIvan L.
