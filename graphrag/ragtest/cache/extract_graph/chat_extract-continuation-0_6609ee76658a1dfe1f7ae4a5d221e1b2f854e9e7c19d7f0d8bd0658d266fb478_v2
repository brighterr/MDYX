Of course, some rev-\nenue is derived from subscriptions, but in the United States the bulk of the media revenue\ncomesfromadvertising.\nAs a result, over the years the word media has been associated with advertising, leading\nmany to think that media are used only or primarily for advertising. Nothing could be further from\nthe truth! As Kelley pointed out in the Part 4 opener, advertising may not provide adequate fi-\nnancial support for the new media forms and all media are looking for new revenue streams in or-\nder to stay in business.\nCHAPTER 11 • MEDIA BASICS 327\nMedia Classifications\nThe plural noun mediais an umbrella term for all types of print, broadcast, out-\nof-home, and Internet communication. The singular noun medium refers to\neach specific type (TVis a medium, for example). Amedia vehicleis a spe-\ncific TVprogram (60 Minutes,The Simpsons), newspaper (The Washington Post,\nChicago Tribune, El Nuevo Herald), magazine (Woman’s Day, GQ), or radio\nstation or program (NPR’s All Things Considered, Rush Limbaugh’s talk\nshow). When a company “buys media,” it is really buying access to the audi-\nences of specific media vehicles. The form that those “buys” take is “space”\n(print, outdoor boards, Internet) and “time” (radio and TV).\nMedia, particularly those used in advertising, are referred to asmass media,\nthe communication channels through which messages are sent to large, diverse\naudiences. Amass medium reaches many people simultaneously and it uses\nsome technological system or device to reach them (as opposed to personal\ncommunication). The size of the audience is the reason why we refer to radio\nand television as broadcasting media—they cast their audio and visual signals\nbroadly to reach mass audiences.\nIn contrast, niche media are communication channels through which\nmessages are sent to niche segments—identifiable groups of people with a dis-\ntinct common interest, such as the Hispanic market served by El Nuevo Herald.\nAdvertising AgeandAdweek,for example, are a subsegment of the more gen-\neral business magazine category. They reach the professional advertising indus-\ntry niche. The distinction between mass and niche is not based necessarily on\nsize. The AARP Magazine,for example, which targets baby boomers age 50(cid:2),\nis a niche publication and yet it is the world’s largest circulation magazine.2\nTwoothercategoriesofmediarefertothewaythemediatransmitthemes- Ethnic media are a type of niche media.\nsages.Addressablemedia,suchastheInternet,mail,andthetelephone,areused El Nuevo Heraldis an example of a\nsuccessful newspaper targeted at an\ntosendbrandmessagestospecificgeographicandelectronicaddresses.Theyare\nethic group, in this case the Spanish-\nparticularly helpful in keeping in touch with current customers or with brand\nspeaking consumers in Miami and South\ncommunities.Interactivemedia,suchasthephoneandInternet,allowtwo-way\nFlorida.\ncommunication between companies and customers, as well as between and\namongconsumers.\nAnother term you’ll see in media plans is measured media, which refers to the ability of\nmedia planners to analyze the cost of a media buy relative to the size of the medium’s audience.\nMetrics are available for traditional media either from the medium itself or from external audit-\ning agencies, but these figures are much harder to find for new and nontraditional media because\nthe auditing procedures for these new media have yet to be developed.\nThe media landscape, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a reporting service that tracks\nadvertising spending, uses the following categories:3\n• Televisionnetwork, cable, syndication, spot (local), Hispanic\n• Radionetwork, national spot, local\n• Newspapersnational, local, Hispanic\n• Magazinesconsumer, B2B, Sunday, local, Hispanic, international\n• Internet\n• Outdoor\n• Branded Entertainment\nAll marketing communication messages other than personal conversations are carried by\nPrinciple\nsomeformofmedia.Inotherwords,mediaarenotjustaconcernofadvertisingplanners.Inte-\nAll marketing\ngratedmarketingcommunication(IMC)mediaconveymessages,suchasbrandpublicityandsales communication messages,\npromotion offers, as well as direct-response messages and loyalty incentive programs.
