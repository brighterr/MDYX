There were the\nusual display ads tied to relevant content.\nFor example, when someone typed in\n“How to Tow a Boat,” HSW would give the\nanswer while displaying an ad about\nTundra’s powerful, high-torque engine.\nThere were 131 towing-related categories\nalone! If “How to Brake While Towing” was\ntyped, the ad would be about the truck’s\nhuge rotors, which gave better braking\nperformance. In addition, HSW created\nover 100 pieces of specific Toyota-branded\ncontent per month for articles relating to\nTundra, as well as Toyota’s Prius and Venza.\nBy tapping into a tight community\nwith relevant, targeted advertising and\ncontent, Toyota was able to garner terrific\nonline metrics and improve its image.\nCHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 395\nTrade associations, such as those serving realtors, have developed innovative services for\ntheir members that make it easy to use online marketing. Local realtors, for example, can sign up\nforRealtor.com,which not only carries online listings, but also provides templates for packaging\nproperties in attractive and accessible formats. The reason realtors value such services is because\nthey realize that more than 80 percent of real estate buyers start their searches on the Internet. Ed\nBurd, who received the Real Estate Online Marketing Award of Excellence from Realtor.com,has\nfound that “print is out of date and there’s less response to traditional advertising.” He likes the\nonline service because he can provide quick responses to prospects and he gets data tracking in-\nformation back from the online service.8\nThe Internet as a Marcom Medium\nOnline marketing communication (marcom) serves five primary purposes. First, it provides a\nbrand reminder message to people who are visiting a website. Second, it works like an ad in tra-\nditional media and delivers an informational or persuasive message. The third purpose, however,\nis critical: it provides a way to entice people to visit the advertiser’s website by clicking on a ban-\nner or button that links to the website. This is called “driving traffic to the website.”\nThe most important roles from a customer-focus perspective, however, are search and inter-\nactivity. These are unique to Internet marketing communication. Search tools, such as Google and\nMicrosoft’s Bing.com,enable customers to find brands, customer reviews, and other product in-\nformation. Interactivity makes it possible for consumers to move away from being a “target” and\ninitiate contact with a company or with other customers and have a conversation about a brand.\nEarly Internet marketing communication sites were either websites providing general infor-\nmation about a company and its brands or an online version of the company’s catalog. More re-\ncently Internet marketers have begun to move beyond the catalog mentality and are using links,\nanimation, and other technology to bring their products to life. Diego Contreras, art director at\nCrispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky, describes how important online communication has become in his The\nInside Story.(CP(cid:2)B, incidentally was named Interactive Agency of the Year at the 2010 Cannes\nFestival.)\nFashion sites, such as Stylecaster, ShopFlick, Smashing Darling, and Saks, use videos, links\nto other designers, and wand-based functions that allow visitors to view fashion items from all\nsides—even the insides of handbags. MyShape.comasks customers to type in body measurements\nand then acts like a personal shopper presenting fashion items specifically chosen to enhance the\ncustomer’s body shape.\nInternet branding is different in some ways from other forms of brand marketing communi-\ncation. As Web consultant John Williams explains, “The Internet is an interactive channel—one\nthat marries text, movement, sound and design to produce a comprehensive brand personality.”\nHe says that this new communication environment is both an opportunity and a challenge be-\ncause, even though you can create an animated brand presence, “visitors remain completely in\ncharge and competitors are just a click away.”9\nWhat Are the Functions of Internet Marcom?\nMarketers and advertisers are most interested in the e-business or e-commerce function of the\nInternet. These terms refer to all of the hardware, software, and computer know-how that provides\na platform for businesses that use the Internet to sell products and manage their business opera-\ntions, such as advertising, customer service, personal sales, internal communication to employ-\nees, and external communication to outside stakeholders. In addition to the e-commerce role,\nother Internet functions that are important to advertisers include the information, entertainment,\nsocial, and the word-of-mouth, or dialogue, roles.\nThe Information Role The most important advertising-related role that the Internet plays is to\nPrinciple\nprovide information for consumer decision making. Beyond shopping on e-business sites, the In-\nThe primary use of the\nternet has developed into a giant online library for consumers of all demographic categories.

Travel sites, information searching.\nsuch as the one shown earlier for the magazine Budget Travel, are particularly popular. Other publi-\ncations exist solely online.
