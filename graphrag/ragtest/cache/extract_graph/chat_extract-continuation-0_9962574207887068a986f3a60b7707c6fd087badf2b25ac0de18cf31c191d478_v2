You will recall the discussions\nof promotional allowances offered to retailers who agree to feature a brand in their ads or provide\nspecial in-store display and price discounts. These are measured by proof of performance such as\n596 PART 5 â€¢ PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\ncopies of store ads and pictures of in-store displays. One responsibility of the sales force is to do\nstore checks to verify that stores are doing what they promised. Promotions that contain a re-\nsponse device, such as coupons, have a built-in evaluation measure.\nAs for consumer promotions, the following evaluation measures are the most popular:\nPrinciple\nProof of performance,\nvarious types of responses Measure % Used\nto promotional tactics, Sales 46\nand payout planning\nResponse rates 20\nprovide built-in evaluation\nmeasures for promotions. Awareness 10\nOther mix 9\nRedemption rates 4\nThe efficiency of a sales promotion offer can be evaluated in terms of its financial returns\nmore easily than advertising. We compare the costs of a promotion, called a payout analysis,to\nthe forecasted sales generated by the promotion. Abreak-even analysisseeks to determine the\npoint at which the total cost of a promotion exceeds the total revenues generated, identifying the\npoint where the promotion is not wise to do. Figure 19.4depicts this analysis.\nPublic Relations The evaluation of public relations examines the success of getting a message\nPrinciple\nout to a target audience in terms of output(materials produced and distributed) and outcomes(ac-\nUltimately, public relations\nefforts are evaluated in ceptance and impact of the materials). Outcomes can be measured in terms of changes in public\nterms of opinion change opinion and relationship tracking. The output evaluation is conducted by asking questions such\nand relationship tracking. as these: How many placements (news releases that ran in the media) did we get? How many\ntimes did our spokesperson appear on talk shows? How much airplay did our public service an-\nnouncements receive or how much and what kind of buzz are Twitters generating? The results are\npresented in terms of counts of minutes, mentions, or inches.\nContent analysis also helps determine the favorability of the coverage, share of voice, and\nissue and competitor coverage. Ongoing public opinion tracking studies ask these questions: Has\nthere been a change in audience knowledge, attitudes, or behavior (e.g., pretesting versus post-\ntesting)? Can we associate behavior change (e.g., product trial, repeat purchase, voting, or join-\ning) with the public relations effort? The most common measures of output and outcomes in\npublic relations are summarized here:\nOutput Objectives Achieved\nâ€¢ ProductionNumber of PR messages, such as news releases or brochures, generated.\nâ€¢ DistributionNumber of media outlets (TVstations, newspapers) receiving PR products.\nâ€¢ CoverageNumber and size of clips, column inches, or minutes of time or space.\nâ€¢ ImpressionsMedia placements multiplied by circulation or broadcast reach.\nâ€¢ Advertising ValueEquivalent ad costs for time or space.\nâ€¢ Content AnalysisPositive or valence (whether the story or mention seems to be more posi-\ntive or negative), key messages (the idea in the story), sources, and prominence.\nOutcome Objectives Achieved\nâ€¢ AwarenessAided and unaided recall.\nâ€¢ AttitudesPerceptions, preferences, and intent to buy.\nâ€¢ BehaviorDid target do what you wanted them to do?\nThe search for methods to tie public relations activities to bottom-line business measures,\nsuch as ROI (return on investment), is like the quest for the Holy Grail. PR practitioners would\nlike to demonstrate ROI because it would provide even more support for the importance of PR\neffects. Asurrogate ROI measure can be based on shareholder value, which can be seen as a com-\npany or brandâ€™s reputation capital. For example, research conducted on companies with the most\neffective employee communication programs has determined that they provide a much higher to-\ntal return to shareholders. Recently Web-based analytical tools are making it possible to connect\nearned media results to online business goals, such as generating website traffic, sales leads, rev-\nenue, and donations for nonprofit organizations.21\nCHAPTER 19 â€¢ EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS 597\nWebsite Evaluation Evaluating the communica-\ntion effects of website advertising is still a new game.\nSome performance indicators are traffic volume,\nsuch as page viewsor the simple number of visitors\nto a site. Banner advertising and other online ads are\nevaluated using click-through rates, and the one\nthing the industry has learned is that this form of ad-\nvertising is decreasing in effectiveness. One problem\nis that people who have little or no interest in the\nproduct may click on the banner by accident or cu-\nriosity. Because this type of advertising is sold by\npay-per-click (PPC), the advertiser has to pay re-\ngardless of the reason for the click. Pop-up banners\ncan get more attention, but they are also seen as more\nirritating.\nInstead of click-through rates, some advertis-\ning uses a cost-per-lead metric that records how\nwell the click-through generates prospects, an at-\ntempt to get at ROI.
