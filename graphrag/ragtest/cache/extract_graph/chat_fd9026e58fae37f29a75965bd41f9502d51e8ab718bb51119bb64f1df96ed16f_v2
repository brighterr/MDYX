The word\nmarket originally meant the place where the exchange be-\ntween seller and buyer took place. Today we speak of a mar- Consumer\nket not only as a place (the New England market), but also as\na particular type of buyer—for example, the youth market or\nthe motorcycle market. The phrase share of marketrefers to\nConsumerAdvertising\nthe percentage of the total sales in a product category a par-\nticular brand has. FIGURE 2.1\nAs Figure 2.1shows, the four main market types are (1) consumer, (2) business-to-business Four Types of Markets\nThe consumer market, which\n(industrial), (3) institutional, and (4) channel markets. We can further divide each of these mar-\nis the target of consumer ad-\nkets by size or geography (local, regional, national, or international).\nvertising is important but it is\nonly one of four types of\n• Consumer marketsconsist of people who buy goods and services for personal or household\nmarkets. The other three are\nuse. As a student, you are considered a member of the consumer market for companies that\nreached through professional\nsell jeans, athletic shoes, sweatshirts, pizza, music, textbooks, backpacks, computers, educa- and trade advertising.\ntion, checking accounts, bicycles, and a multitude of other products that you buy at drug-\nstores and grocery stores, which the marketing industry refers to as package goods(In\nEurope these are called fast-moving consumer goods or fmcg.)\n• Business-to-business (B2B) marketsconsist of companies that buy products or services to use\nin their own businesses or in making other products. General Electric, for example, buys com-\nputers to use in billing and inventory control, steel and wiring to use in the manufacture of its\nproducts, and cleaning supplies to use in maintaining its buildings. Advertising in this category\ntends to be heavy on factual content and information but it can also be beautifully designed as\nPeter Stasiowski’s ads for Interprint demonstrate (see the previous Day in the Lifefeature).\n• Institutionalmarketsincludeawidevarietyofnonprofitorganizations,suchashospitals,\ngovernmentagencies,andschoolsthatprovideservicesforthebenefitofsociety.Universities,\nforexample,areinthemarketforfurniture,cleaningsupplies,computers,officesupplies,gro-\nceries,audiovisualmaterial,papertowels,andtoiletpaper,tonameafew.Suchadsaresimilar\ntoB2Badsinthattheyaregenerallyheavyonfactsandlightonemotionalappeals.\n• Channel markets,as discussed earlier, include members of the distribution chain, which is\nmade up of businesses we call resellers,orintermediaries.Channel marketing,the process\nof targeting a specific campaign to members of the distribution channel, is more important now\nthat manufacturers consider their distributors to be partners in their marketing programs. As gi-\nant retailers such as Walmart become more powerful, they can even dictate to manufacturers\nwhat products their customers want to buy and how much they are willing to pay for them.\nMost advertising dollars are spent on consumer markets, although B2B advertising is be-\ncoming almost as important. Firms usually reach consumer markets through mass media and\nother marketing communication tools. They typically reach the other three markets—industrial,\ninstitutional, and channel or reseller—through trade and professional advertising in specialized\nmedia, such as trade journals, professional magazines, and direct mail, but even more so through\npersonal sales and trade shows and promotions.\nWhy Is Services Marketing Important? When some people think about “products,” they only\nthink about goods. This is unfortunate because services are the dominant part of the economy in\nmost developed countries. Health care, for example, is one of the largest industries in the United\nStates and it is a service industry.\nMarketing a service-based business, however, is different in a number of ways from mar-\nketing goods. For one thing, the product—insurance, banking, travel planning—is often intangi-\nble, although some services that “touch things” have a more tangible dimension, such as lawn\n38 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nThis group of ads demonstrates advertising\ndirected at the three types of markets: consumer\n(Keds), institutional (GE aircraft engines), and\nchannel (“\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
