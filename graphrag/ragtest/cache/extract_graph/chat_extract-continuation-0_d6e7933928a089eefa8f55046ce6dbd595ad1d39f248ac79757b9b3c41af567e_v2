Think of the cursive type used for Coca-Cola,\nthe block letters used for IBM, and the apple with a bite out of it (in both rainbow stripes and\nwhite) for Apple computers. Also check out the logo designs by Michael Dattolico.\nBrand icons are characters associated with a brand, such Mr. Peanut, Chester the Cheetah,\nUncle Ben, and Ronald McDonald. If they are effective, they become an enduring symbol of the\nbrand. Initially the character is designed to reflect the desired brand personality. The Jolly Green\nGiant is an imaginary and kind friend who encourages kids to eat their vegetables. Over time,\nhowever, they may need to be updated as the Betty Crocker image has been a number of times.\nThe trade magazine Adweekcelebrates brand icons and annually inducts winners into its Madi-\nson Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame event every fall. Check these out at www.adweek.com.\nPackage design is another area where brand image is front and center. Sometimes the brand\nlink is in the shape of the packaging as in the distinctive grandmotherly Mrs. Butterworth syrup\nbottles (see an example at www.mrsbutterworthsyrup.com). It may also be in the stylistics as we\nhave shown with Celestial Seasonings tea boxes (see Chapter 2). The package design also ac-\ncommodates strategic elements with positioning statements, flags that reference current cam-\npaigns, recipes, and pricing announcements. During the Great Recession, a number of\nmanufacturers found that new packaging with retro designs appealed to consumers. Check out the\nRitz crackers, Oreo cookies, and Corn Flakes brands, among others.\nThere’s always a tension in advertising between doing something over the top that’s creative\nand attention getting and being responsible to the brand image, the strategy, and society. The ac-\nceptability of a wacky image in an ad depends, in part, on its targeting, but it also depends on\njudgment and intuition. Our ethics discussions in this book often focus on the appropriateness of\nan image and how it reflects on the brand.\nFor example, an ad for Vaseline Intensive Care Lotion shows a conference room with a\nspeaker and a group of businesspeople—both men and women—paying careful attention to the\npresentation. In the foreground is a happy woman in a business suit with her back to the speaker\nand her colleagues. Her legs are up on the table and she’s caressing them. Unfortunately she’s also\na black woman. The headline reads: “Nothing keeps you from handling your business.” So does\nVaseline Intensive Care want us to know that if black women use their product, they become to-\ntally clueless in a business meeting? The point is that what appears to the creative team to be a\ndynamite visual may, on reflection, send a number of contrary messages.\nEnvironmental Design\nRemember we have said that everything communicates and that includes the design of the envi-\nronment in which goods and services are offered for sale. The architectural design and interior\nambiance of a store contribute to its brand personality. If you have been in a Polo store or Polo\n™\n™\nSHOWCASE\nThese logos were designed by Michael Dattolico, who owns his own\ndesign studio, MusionCreative LLC (www.musioncreative.com).\nA graduate of the University of Florida\nadvertising program, Michael Dattolico\nwas nominated by Professor Elaine\nWagner.\n296 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nsection in a department store, you might remember some of the details of the environment that\nmake the space different from, say, a Sears department, not to mention a Nike or Patagonia store.\nNike stores have even been described as retail theater with displays and spaces that showcase not\nonly the shoes and apparel, but also the sports with which they are associated.\nThinkaboutthelasttimeyouwenttoasit-downrestaurantversusyourexperiencesinfast-food\nplaces.What’sthedifferenceinthewaythesespacesaredesignedbothinsideandoutside?Think\naboutthecolorsandsurfacesandtypesoffurniture.GraphicdesignerAmyNiswongerhasbeenfol-\nlowingtheredesignofMcDonald’sinteriorsandexplainswhatshehasobservedinTheInsideStory.\nWHAT IS ART DIRECTION?\nThe person most responsible for creating visual impact, as well as the brand identification ele-\nments, is the art director. The art director is in charge of the visual look of the advertisement, both\nin print and TV, and how it communicates mood, product qualities, and psychological appeals.\nThe art director and copywriter team usually work together to come up with the Big Idea, but the\nart director is responsible for bringing the visual side of the idea to life.\nSpecifically,artdirectorsmakedecisionsaboutwhethertouseartorphotographyinprintand\nfilm or animation in television and what type of artistic style to use.They are highly trained in\ngraphicdesign,includingart,photography,typography,theuseofcolor,andcomputerdesignsoft-\nware.Althoughartdirectorsgenerallydesignthead,theyrarelycreatethefinishedart.Iftheyneed\nanillustration,theyhireanartist.NewspaperandWebadvertisingvisualsareoftenclipartorclick\nart,imagesfromcollectionsofcopyright-freeartthatanyonewhobuystheclip-artservicecanuse.\nInaddition\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MICHAEL DATTOLICO<|>PERSON<|>Michael Dattolico is a graphic designer who owns MusionCreative LLC and is a graduate of the University of Florida advertising program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSIONCREATIVE LLC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MusionCreative LLC is a design studio owned by Michael Dattolico)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Florida is an educational institution where Michael Dattolico graduated from the advertising program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADWEEK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Adweek is a trade magazine that celebrates brand icons and inducts winners into its Madison Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame event annually)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADISON AVENUE ADVERTISING WALK OF FAME<|>EVENT<|>An annual event organized by Adweek to celebrate and induct brand icons)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY NISWONGER<|>PERSON<|>Amy Niswonger is a graphic designer who has been following the redesign of McDonald's interiors)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MC DONALD'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McDonald's is a fast-food chain known for its distinctive interior design, which has been undergoing redesign)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHAEL DATTOLICO<|>MUSIONCREATIVE LLC<|>Michael Dattolico owns MusionCreative LLC<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHAEL DATTOLICO<|>UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA<|>Michael Dattolico is a graduate of the University of Florida advertising program<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADWEEK<|>MADISON AVENUE ADVERTISING WALK OF FAME<|>Adweek organizes the Madison Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame event<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY NISWONGER<|>MC DONALD'S<|>Amy Niswonger has been following the redesign of McDonald's interiors<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
