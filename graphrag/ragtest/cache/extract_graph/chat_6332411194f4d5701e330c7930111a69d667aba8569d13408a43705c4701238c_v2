The following table shows the Television Standard Day-\nparts. The most expensive time block is prime time.\n• Spot AnnouncementsThe third form a television commercial can take is the spot an-\nnouncement.Spot announcements are commercials that appear in the breaks between pro-\ngrams, which local affiliates sell to advertisers who want to show their ads locally.\nCommercials are sold on a station-by-station basis to local, regional, and national advertis-\ners. However, local buyers dominate spot television. PSAs are also distributed to stations for\nlocal play based on the station’s time availability.\nStandard Television Dayparts\nEarly morning M–F 7–9 A.M.\nDaytime M–F 9 A.M.–4:30P.M.\nEarly fringe M–F 4:30–7:30 P.M.\nPrime access M–F 7:30–8 P.M.\nM–S 8–11 P.M.\nSu 7–11 P.M.\nLate news M–Su 11–11:30 P.M.\nLate night M–Su 11:30 P.M.–1A.M.\nSaturday morning Sa 8 A.M.–1P.M.\nWeekend afternoon Sa–Su 1 P.M.–7P.M.\nNote:All times are Eastern Standard Time (EST).\nMedia sales operations are trying to encourage advertising through various types of part-\nnerships and cooperative advertising strategies. We have already mentioned ESPN’s “mini-\nmercials,” which embed a brand’s reminder ad in the opening of a sports program. Another\nexample comes from Campbell’s Soup and CBS, which partnered in an advertising campaign that\npaired various shows with different types of Campbell soups.\nEffectiveness of Television Television is used because of the reach it delivers. You may re- Principle\nmember from our previous discussions of our Facets of Effects Model that one of the most im- If you are going to use\nportant effects is awareness.

The study compared TV and the Internet and and emotional impact.\ndetermined that television had more impact, particularly at the awareness stage.38\nTelevision advertising also makes a strong visual and emotional impact. The interaction of\nsight, sound, color, motion, and drama creates a stronger emotional response than most other\nforms of advertising media. In Chapter 4we mentioned engagement,which certainly applies to\nTV. Television is particularly good at creating messages that can be highly engrossing. Even with\nTiVo, people still sit through advertisements and use online search engines to seek out advertis-\ning that is relevant to them.39Television is also good for delivering messages that require action,\nmovement, and demonstration, such as the messages created for Avista Utilities in Portland,\nOregon. When it comes to energy efficiency, Karl Schroeder explains, every little bit adds up—\nusing energy-efficient bulbs, cleaning the coils on a refrigerator, using Energy Star appliances,\nand other environmental practices. To spread this idea and empower customers, the messages\ndemonstrate different actions folks can take to improve the efficiency of their home.\nTelevision has drawbacks, as well. The commercial breaks between programs can be diffi-\ncult time slots for advertisers because there is a great deal of clutter from competing commercials,\nPrinciple\nstation breaks, and public service announcements. Commercial breaks also tend to be the time\nAs the number of\nwhen viewers take a break from their television sets.

Cable television is much more diminishes.\n382 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\ntargeted than network and spot television, so it has less waste. Disinterest is\nanother problem because people are often inclined to zip(fast forward) or\nzap(change channels) commercials if they don’t have a DVR.\nAnother big drawback is that television advertising is expensive rela-\ntive to other media, both for time and production costs. (Note:Television is\n“expensive” in terms of dollar amounts even though it is relatively cheap in\nterms of gross impressions because its audience is so much larger than that\nof other media.) A30-second, prime-time spot averages about $185,000, and\nmost advertisers would want to run a commercial multiple times. That av-\nerage, however, doesn’t mean much because costs vary considerably for a\nhighly rated prime-time show versus a lower rated program. Production\ncosts are higher than ads in other media, as well. They include filming the\ncommercial (several thousand to several hundred thousand dollars) and\npaying the talent—writers, directors, and actors. When celebrities are used,\nthe price tag can be millions of dollars for the campaign budget.\nAnother problem is clutter, and its stepchildren, intrusiveness and\nirritation. In the past, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) re-\nstricted the allowable commercial time per hour to approximately 6 min-\nutes, but the Justice Department overturned this restriction and the number\nof commercials has increased significantly (up to 20 minutes per hour of\nprogramming). As the number of commercials increases,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
