Although a rule of thumb for advertising is that it should be\nsingle minded, we also know from Chapter 4that multiple effects are often needed to create the\ndesired impact. Some ads may use an emotional strategy while others are informational, but some-\ntimes the message needs to speak to both the head and the heart. That was particularly true for the\nCoke Zero campaign: customers needed to understand that the taste of Coke Zero was similar to\nregular Coke but it had to do it with a style and attitude that twenty-something males would like.\nAlthough some objectives are tightly focused on one particular effect, others, such as brand\nloyalty, call for a more complex set of effects. To create brand loyalty, for example, an advertising\ncampaign must have both cognitive (rational) and affective (emotional) effects, and it must move\npeople to repeat buying. That’s one reason brand loyalty is considered a type of long-term impact\ndeveloped over time from many experiences that a consumer has with a brand and brand messages.\nNote also that communication objectives may be important, even if they aren’t focused di-\nrectly on a sale. For example, Expedia.com, a travel consulting company, views its advertising as\na way to draw attention to itself, create name recognition, and create understanding of the prod-\nucts and services it sells.\nMeasurable Objectives We cannot overstate the importance of writing focused and measurable\nadvertising objectives. Every campaign, and the ads in it, must be guided by specific, clear, and\nmeasurable objectives. We say measurable objectivesbecause that’s how the effectiveness of ad-\nvertising is determined. It is also critical that an objective be benchmarked, which means the\nplanner uses a comparable effort, such as a similar product or prior brand campaign, to predict a\nlogical goal. Ameasurable objective includes five requirements:\n1. Aspecific effectthat can be measured\n2. Atime frame\n3. Abaseline(where we are or where we begin)\n4. The goal(a realistic estimate of the change the campaign can create; benchmarking is used\nto justify the projected goal)\n5. Percentagechange(subtractthebaselinefromthegoal;dividethedifferencebythe\nbaseline).\nAhypothetical objective, then, would read like this: The goal of this campaign is to move the\ntarget’s awareness of Coke Zero’s taste similarity with regular Coke from 18 to 23 percent within\n12 months,an increase of 28 percent.\nTargeting\nWe discussed targeting and segmenting in Chapter 5, which are strategic decisions made possi-\nble because of a deep knowledge of consumers. In particular, this research-based knowledge iden-\ntifies what makes specific groups of consumers different from people in other groups. These\ncharacteristics also identify how consumers are similar to others in ways that characterize a spe-\ncific type of viewpoint or lifestyle, such as the student partying lifestyle on many campuses, a\nproblem addressed by the Navigators’posters.\n200 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nSHOWCASE\nThese anti–drunk driving posters were used in the Nightlife Navigators campaign at the University of Florida. They were created by\nthe Adwerks student-run advertising agency.\nAs we discussed in Chapter 5, segmenting and targeting are important because marketing\ncommunication strategy is based on accurately targeting an audience that will be responsive to a\nparticular type of message, one that will deliver the objectives.\nThere is more to targeting than just identifying and profiling a possible audience. How does\nthe target audience relate to the brand? General Mills, for example, during the recent recession\nwas able to maintain significant marketing increases by concentrating on its big-name brands, but\nalso on its multicultural consumers, which the marketer saw as a “high ROI area.”5Advertising\nplanners also want to know what’s going on in people’s heads and hearts—what motivates them\nto attend to a message and respond to it. Getting deeper insight into consumers is the responsi-\nbility of the account planning function. We’ll return to that role later in this chapter.\nWe want to emphasize that understanding a target audience demands an appreciation of\ndiversity—and the empathy that results from such an appreciation. Professor Peggy Kreshel de-\nfines diversityas “the acknowledgment and inclusion of a wide variety of people with differ-\ning characteristics, attributes, beliefs, values, and experiences.” In advertising, diversity tends\nto be discussed primarily in terms of representations of gender,race,andethnicity in advertis-\ning content,although as she points out in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FORD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ford is an automobile manufacturer known for its \"SYNC\" campaign targeting Hispanic consumers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLD NAVY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Old Navy is a clothing retailer known for its \"SuperModelquins\" campaign)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COKE ZERO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Coke Zero is a beverage brand known for its \"Taste Infringement\" campaign, emphasizing its taste similarity to regular Coke)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPECIAL K<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Special K is a cereal brand known for its \"2-Week Challenge\" campaign encouraging consumer participation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXPEDIA.COM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Expedia.com is a travel consulting company that uses advertising to create name recognition and understanding of its products and services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERAL MILLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>General Mills is a food company that maintained marketing increases by focusing on big-name brands and multicultural consumers during a recession)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Florida is an educational institution where the Nightlife Navigators campaign was conducted to address student partying lifestyle)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADWERKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Adwerks is a student-run advertising agency that created anti-drunk driving posters for the Nightlife Navigators campaign)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEGGY KRESHEL<|>PERSON<|>Professor Peggy Kreshel is known for her work on diversity in advertising, emphasizing the inclusion of a wide variety of people with differing characteristics)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORD<|>OLD NAVY<|>Both Ford and Old Navy have conducted notable advertising campaigns targeting specific consumer groups<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COKE ZERO<|>SPECIAL K<|>Both Coke Zero and Special K have conducted campaigns encouraging consumer participation and brand engagement<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXPEDIA.COM<|>GENERAL MILLS<|>Both Expedia.com and General Mills focus on creating brand recognition and understanding through advertising<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA<|>ADWERKS<|>Adwerks created the Nightlife Navigators campaign at the University of Florida<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEGGY KRESHEL<|>GENERAL MILLS<|>Peggy Kreshel's work on diversity in advertising is relevant to General Mills' focus on multicultural consumers<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
