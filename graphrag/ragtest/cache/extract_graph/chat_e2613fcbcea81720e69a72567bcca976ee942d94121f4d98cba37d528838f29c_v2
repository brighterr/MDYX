For example, Ford used a banner on the Yahoo! home page with the\nfamiliar Ford oval and a bunch of little black birds on a wire. Then three of the birds flew down\nto the middle of the page and started pecking at what looked like birdseed, uncovering an image\nof the new Explorer. The link read: “Click to uncover the next territory.” Those who did click\nprobably expected a pop-up image, but instead the page shook, the birds scattered, and a big red\nFord Explorer drove up to the front of the screen, replacing most of the content. It was a surpris-\ning, highly involving, and effective announcement of the vehicle.\nBecause users can create their own paths through the website, designers have to make sure\nthat their sites have clear navigation.Users should be able to move through the site easily, find\nthe information they want, and respond. Navigation problems can really turn off viewers. Eye-\ntracking research (studies that use a camera to follow eye movement when looking at a page or\nscreen) has found that if the navigation is cluttered or unclear, viewers will give up and move on\nto some other site.11Ideally, users who visit a site regularly should be able to customize the site\nto fit their own interests and navigation patterns.\nOnline video has also expanded the avenues for action on the small screen on minicomputers,\npersonal digital assistants, and cell phones. Web video is becoming a new business opportunity for\nbusinesses that want to use videos to display their products. The secret is to plan these videos specif-\nically for a small screen and not just try to use regular television or film images because the screen\nis just a fraction of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
