As we have said, dialogue-based communication is the\nfoundation for brand relationships. DMC is also important because of its ability to track effec-\ntiveness. Now in the next chapter let’s consider the various ways people are engaged in brand ex-\nperiences through promotions.\nIT’S A WRAP\nThe Gecko and Friends\nDrive Customer Response\nIn this chapter we identified many benefits of using direct-response marketing. It can reach a large, diverse\naudience efficiently to generate customers for auto insurance. GEICO’s aggressive effort to blanket the na-\ntion with an array of campaigns, including The Gecko, the Cavemen, the customer/celebrity testimonials, and\n“Rhetorical Questions,” teaches an important brand communication lesson about direct marketing. It demon-\nstrates how effective direct-response advertising and a little bit of humor can sell a product to a wide-ranging\nand varied audience, even in a tough economy.\nOne report estimated 2007 auto-industry advertising expenditures at $1.7 billion, with GEICO, Allstate,\nProgressive Corp., and State Farm accounting for about 73 percent of the total. GEICO reportedly spent\n$561 million on advertising in 2008. In lieu of a sales force, direct advertising does the job.\nThe Gecko and Caveman have earned their way into the hearts of consumers, winning many awards in-\ncluding the Direct Marketing Association’s Echo award. The Caveman joined The Gecko as a favorite brand\nicon, having been elected to the Madison Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame. According to the GEICO web-\nsite, “The Caveman, still perturbed with GEICO for its ‘So easy, a caveman could do it’ slogan, did not attend\nthe award ceremony.”\nKey Points Summary\n1.How does direct-response marketing work?Direct mar- 3.How are databases used in direct marketing?Direct mar-\nketing always involves a one-on-one relationship with the keting advertising has benefited from the development and\nprospect.
