Most ad-\nvertisingismoreeffectiveatretainingusersratherthanconvertingnewones.\nThese differences explain why some experts believe that the communication effects, such as\nemotion, knowledge, and persuasion, are merely “surrogate” effects—communication effects that\ncan be measured more easily than sales but are less important to marketing managers. Others be-\nlieve these communication effects are important in and of themselves because of what they con-\ntribute to brand strength.\nComplicating the issue is the recognition that the impact of traditional advertising is seldom\nimmediate. When you see an ad for a new product that catches your attention, such as a new mu-\nsic group or CD, and you concentrate on the message, you may think about the ad later when you\nfind yourself walking by a music store. Thus, your memory is involved in recalling not just the\nad and the brand, but the content of the message. But memory is unreliable and the impressions\nmay not be embedded sufficiently in memory to elicit this kind of response at a later date.\nPrinciple\nIn other words, advertising is a victim of delayed effects:messages are seen and heard at\nAdvertising has delayed\none time (at home on the TV, in the car on the radio, in the doctor’s office in a magazine ad) and\neffects in that a consumer\nmay or may not come to mind at a later date when you are in a purchase situation (in a store, in a\nmay see or hear an\ncar looking for a place to eat).

The important conclusion to the bigger ques-\ntion about how advertising works is that we know that advertising (and other marketing commu-\nnication) does work when it’s carefully planned and executed. It may not work in every situation\nand every ad may not be equally effective, but if it’s done right, then advertising can\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
