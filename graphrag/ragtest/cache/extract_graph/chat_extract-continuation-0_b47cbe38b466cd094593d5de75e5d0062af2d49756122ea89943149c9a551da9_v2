The idea is that other people—\nfriends, family, teachers, and experts such as doctors—may affect your decision making.\nTestimonies—from real people, celebrities (the “Got Milk?” campaign), and experts—are\noften used to change attitudes. Bandwagon appeals—messages that suggest that everyone\nis doing it—are also used to influence people’s decisions. Word-of-mouthcommunication\n118 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nSHOWCASE\nFor a YMCA membership drive in Orlando, Florida, the objective was not just to get new members, but\nkeep them—and keep them participating. To drive conviction, the FHB agency in Orlando developed a\ncampaign highlighting real members’ commitments to mind, body, and spirit. With its bold,\ngraphic look the campaign attracted attention and was positively received.\nThese ads were contributed by Lara Mann, a graduate of the University\nof Florida, whose work was nominated for inclusion by Professor Elaine\nWagner.\nhas always been recognized as the most powerful form of persuasion, and that’s why strate-\ngies that engage influencers are so important.\n• InvolvementAdvertisers distinguish between products, messages, and media on the basis of\nthe level of involvement they require from the buyer. Involvementrefers to the degree to\nwhich you are engaged in attending to an ad and the process you go through in responding to\na message and making a product decision. Some products, for instance, cosmetics, call for a\nmore involving process than others, say, toothpaste. High-involvementproducts are consid-\nered purchases;in other words, purchases for which consumers spend more time and effort\nsearching for information and comparison data before they make decisions. Considered\npurchasesincludes such products as cars and computers, as well as things you care about a\nlot like clothes and cosmetics. Examples of low-involvementproducts are aspirin, paper\nnapkins, envelopes, paper clips, milk, and lettuce. The idea is that you think about some\nproducts and reflect on the advertising you see for them, but with other products you don’t\nspend much time thinking about them before you buy them. Nor do you pay much attention\nto their advertising, which you may ignore or file away without much thought.\nSome message strategies are more involving than others, such as dramas and humor.\nLikewise, various types of media are intrinsically more or less involving. Television, for ex-\nample, is considered to be less involving than print, which demands more concentration\nfrom its readers than TVdoes of its viewers—although a gripping TVdrama can be involv-\nCHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 119\ning because of the power of the storyline. Marketing communication tools, such as sales pro-\nmotions, events, and brand clubs, are inherently more involving, particularly the ones that\nallow customers to have more personal contact with the brand.\n• EngagementThe idea of engagementis that a consumer is more than just interested in\nsomething, that he or she is, in the words of the Advertising Research Foundation committee\nthat investigated engagement, “turned on.”33Participation strategies, for example, get con-\nsumers involved with a brand on a personal level. Engagement cultivates passion.\n• ConvictionEffective persuasion results in conviction,which means consumers agree with a\npersuasive message and achieve a state of certainty—a belief—about a brand. Afactor in\nconviction is the power of the argument,which uses logic, reasons, and proof to make a\npoint and build conviction. Understanding an argument is a complex cognitive process that\ndemands the audience “follow through” on the reasoning to understand the point and reach a\nconclusion.\n• Preference and IntentionWhen consumers marry belief with a preferencefor, or an\nintentionto try or buy, a product, they are motivated by conviction. Intention can be\nheightened with reward strategies, such as good deals, sale pricing, and gifts. An example\nof persuasive work designed to create conviction is the Orlando, Florida, YMCAads. Good\nintentions are the motivations behind cause marketing and social responsibility. Hewlett-\nPackard, for example, promotes its computer recycling program to increase preference for\nHPproducts by its customers. According to the company’s vice president of global brand-\ning and marketing communication, the PC recycling program attracts consumers to HP\nproducts because the company assumes responsibility for recycling its old products. That’s\na benefit for customers and leads to higher customer satisfaction and, thus, loyalty to the\nHPbrand.\n• LoyaltyIs there any brand you buy, use, or visit on a regular basis? Do you have a favorite\nshampoo, restaurant, or beverage? Why is that? What we are referring to when we talk about\na “favorite” brand is preference, but also brand loyalty,which we mentioned in Chapter 2.\nLoyaltyis an attitude (respect, preference), an emotion (liking), and an action (repeat pur-\nchases). It is a response to brand communication that crosses over between thinking, feeling,\nand doing—a response that is built on customer satisfaction.If you try a product and like it,\nthen you will be more likely to buy it again. If you don’t like it, is there a return policy or\nguarantee that frees you from risk when you buy something for the first time? Providing in-\nformation about warranties, customer service, and technical support for technology products\nis an important part of brand loyalty strategies. The idea is to reduce risk and put the cus-\ntomer’s mind at ease. Incentives are also used in loyalty programs, such as frequent flyer\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>YMCA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>YMCA is an organization that conducted a membership drive in Orlando, Florida, focusing on mind, body, and spirit commitments of its members<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORLANDO<|>GEO<|>Orlando is a city in Florida where the YMCA membership drive took place<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FHB AGENCY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FHB Agency is an advertising agency in Orlando that developed a campaign for the YMCA membership drive<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARA MANN<|>PERSON<|>Lara Mann is a graduate of the University of Florida whose work was nominated for inclusion by Professor Elaine Wagner<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Florida is an educational institution where Lara Mann graduated from<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELAINE WAGNER<|>PERSON<|>Elaine Wagner is a professor who nominated Lara Mann's work for inclusion<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEWLETT-PACKARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hewlett-Packard is a company that promotes its computer recycling program to increase preference for its products<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YMCA<|>FHB AGENCY<|>FHB Agency developed a campaign for the YMCA membership drive<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARA MANN<|>UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA<|>Lara Mann is a graduate of the University of Florida<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARA MANN<|>ELAINE WAGNER<|>Elaine Wagner nominated Lara Mann's work for inclusion<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEWLETT-PACKARD<|>ORLANDO<|>Hewlett-Packard's recycling program is mentioned as an example of cause marketing in the context of Orlando's YMCA campaign<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
