This information then feeds back into marketing plans,\nwhere it can stimulate new product developmentsthat are bet-\nter designed to more efficiently and effectively meet customer\nneeds. The consumer-generated content mentioned in Chapter 1\nhas a parallel in marketing. For example, Threadless.com, an on-\nline T-shirt retailer, invited consumers to create a T-shirt design\nand upload it to the site where other consumers get to vote for\nwinners that will be offered for sale on the site.4\nIn advertising, the difference between a product and a con-\nsumer focus lies in the orientation of the ad. Is it addressing a\nconsumer’s benefit or a product’s feature? Ideally it will do both\nby interpreting product features in terms of consumer benefits.\nUnited Airlines uses a consumer-focused approach for its Escapes\nvacation planning service and a product focus for its Mileage\nPlus frequent flyer program, which is shown here.\nA note about terminology: We often use the words con-\nsumerandcustomerinterchangeably, but there are some differ-\nences in meaning. Consumeris a general term for people who\nbuy and use products and services, which is almost all of us. It’s\nThis United Airlines ad similar to the phrase general public.(However, we also make a\ndemonstrates a distinction between consumer and trade products and promotions, which recognizes that busi-\ncorporate orientation. nesses and organizations also buy and use products and services, as well as individual con-\nDo you believe it is sumers.)

Customers have a closer link to a brand or a store because they have\ntaken action by buying or visiting. By virtue of that action, these people can be said to have a re-\nlationship with a brand or store.\nDifferentiation, Competitive Advantage, and Positioning Although customer-centric market-\ning is important, marketing experts also point to the importance of differentiation as a selling\nstrategy. They recommend strategies that are informed by consumers, but led by fundamental\nmarketing decisions that make the brand stand out as differ-\nent from its competition, a process known as positioning.5\nHow a brand is different and superior in some way is\ncalledcompetitive advantage.This concept is referred to in\nmarketing strategy as product differentiation.The point of\ndifference is seen in the way the product is positioned relative\nto its competitors. We’ll talk about positioning more in the\nbranding discussion later in this chapter and in Chapter 7. A\nproduct can be differentiated and therefore positioned in a va-\nriety of ways: by price, design, performance, distribution, and\nbrand image. In a market-driven economy, product features\nand claims, such as quality and cheaper price, help marketers\nestablish an advantage over the competition.\nAclassic example of differentiation is Maytag washers,\nwhich are sold based on their quality of design and con-\nThe Wii video game has the advantage of a large video\nstruction and, hence, reliability.

Advertising\nand other marketing communication not only showcase the product’s\nvalue but also may add value by making the product appear more desir-\nable. Providing news and useful information of interest to consumers\nis another way that advertising adds value, as the United ad demon-\nstrates. An example comes from a commercial for Idaho Potatoes, which\nprovides information about peeling potatoes as a strategy to reinforce its\ndominance of its category.\nOtheraspectsofmarketingstrategycanaddvalue.Forexample,the\nmoreconvenienttheproductistobuy,themorevaluableitistothecus-\ntomer.Likewise,thelowertheprice,themoreusefulfeaturesaproduct\nhas,orthehigheritsquality,themoreacustomermayvalueit.Ensuring\nthe product’s utility and convenience is one of the tasks of customer-\noriented marketing and the point of many advertisements.These other\naspectsthataddvaluearefoundinthemarketingmixstrategy.\nWhat Is the Marketing Mix?\nAs mentioned earlier and as shown in Figure 2.2, the traditional marketing mix includes four pri- Dawn Wells, who\nmary elements, sometimes referred to as the “four Ps”: the product, its price and place of distribu- played Mary Ann on\ntion, and its promotion (marketing communication).* To a marketing manager, marketing Gilligan’s Island,\ndemonstrates a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>THREADLESS.COM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Threadless.com is an online T-shirt retailer that engages consumers by allowing them to create and vote on T-shirt designs<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED AIRLINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>United Airlines is an airline company that uses a consumer-focused approach for its Escapes vacation planning service and a product focus for its Mileage Plus frequent flyer program<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYTAG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Maytag is a brand known for its quality design and construction of washers, marketed with the slogan \"The Dependability People\" and the \"lonely repairman\" character<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NINTENDO WII<|>PRODUCT<|>The Nintendo Wii is a video game console known for its large video screen and hands-on demonstrations that were key to its successful market introduction<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARLEY-DAVIDSON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Harley-Davidson is a motorcycle brand with a strong brand image that adds value and desirability to its products<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IDAHO POTATOES<|>PRODUCT<|>Idaho Potatoes are marketed with information about peeling potatoes to reinforce their dominance in the category<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THREADLESS.COM<|>CONSUMERS<|>Threadless.com engages consumers by allowing them to create and vote on T-shirt designs<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED AIRLINES<|>CONSUMERS<|>United Airlines uses a consumer-focused approach in its marketing strategy<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYTAG<|>CONSUMERS<|>Maytag's marketing strategy instills a perception of reliability in consumers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NINTENDO WII<|>CONSUMERS<|>Nintendo Wii's hands-on demonstrations were key to its successful introduction to consumers<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARLEY-DAVIDSON<|>CONSUMERS<|>Harley-Davidson's advertising creates a strong brand image that adds value and desirability to its products for consumers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IDAHO POTATOES<|>CONSUMERS<|>Idaho Potatoes provide useful information to consumers to reinforce their category dominance<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
