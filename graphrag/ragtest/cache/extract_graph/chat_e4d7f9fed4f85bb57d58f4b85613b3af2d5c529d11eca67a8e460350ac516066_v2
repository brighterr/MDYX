Aselling premisestates the logic behind the sales offer. Apremise is\na proposition on which an argument is based or a conclusion is drawn. This type of message strat-\negy is usually a rational approach, an appeal to the head.\nAbasic selling premise is designed to sell a product based on tested principles, or selling\npremises, that, as Edd Applegate reminds us in his book, Strategic Copywriting,have been shown\nto work time after time.12 To have a practical effect on customers, managers must identify the\nproduct’s features(also called attributes) in terms of those that are most important to the target\naudience. Another type of selling premise is a claim,which is a product-focused strategy that is\nbased on a prediction about how the product will perform. Health claims on food products like\noatmeal, for example, suggest that the food will be good for you.\nArational, prospect-centered selling premise identifies a reason that might appeal to poten-\ntial customers and motivate them to respond. Here is a summary of these rational customer-\nfocused selling premises:\n• Abenefitemphasizes what the product can do for the user by translating the product feature\nor attribute into something that benefits the consumer. For example, a GM electric car ad fo-\ncuses on the product feature (the car doesn’t use gas) and translates it into a benefit: lack of\nnoise (no pistons, valves, exhaust).\n• Apromiseis a benefit statement that looks to the future and predicts that something good\nwill happen if you use the product. For example, Dial soap has promised for decades that if\nyou use Dial, you will feel more confident.\nPrinciple\n• Areason whyemphasizes the logic behind why you should buy something, although the\nIn the comparison\nreason sometimes is implied or assumed. The word becauseis the key to a reason-why state-\napproach, as with a\nment. For example, an Amtrak ad tells you that train travel is more comfortable than flying demonstration, seeing is\nbecause Amtrak is a more civilized, less dehumanizing way to travel. believing, so the objective\n• Aunique selling proposition (USP)is a benefit statement that is both unique to the product is to build conviction.\nand important to the user. The USPis a promise that\nconsumers will get this unique benefit by using this\nproduct only. For example, an ad for a camera states,\n“This camera is the only one that lets you zoom in and\nout automatically to follow the action.”\nMost selling premises demand facts, proof, or explana-\ntions to support the sales message. Proof statements that give\nthe rationale, reasoning, and research behind the claim are\nused to substantiate the premise. The proof or substantiation\nneeded to make a claim believable is called support. In\nmany cases this calls for research findings. With claims, and\nparticularly with comparisons, the proof is subject to chal-\nlenge by the competitor as well as industry review boards.\nOther Message Formulas In addition to the basic cate-\ngories of selling premises, some common message formulas\nemphasize different types of effects. The planner uses these\nterms as a way to give direction to the creative team and to\nshape the executions. Here are some common formats:\n• Astraightforwardmessage,which is factual or infor-\nmational, conveys information without any gimmicks,\nemotions, or special effects. For example, in an ad for\nwww.women.com,the website advertises that “It’s where\ntoday’s educated, affluent women are finding in-depth\ncoverage on issues they care about” and that more than\n2 million women visit each month.\n• Ademonstrationfocuses on how to use the product or\nwhat it can do for you. For example, an ad for Kellogg’s\nSpecial K and Smart Start uses cereal bowls to demon-\nThe Kellogg’s Smart Start ad uses 28 cereal bowls to\nstrate how a daily regimen of healthy cereal would help demonstrate the amount that Special K and Smart Start\na dieter lose six pounds. equal in weight loss.\n240 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\n• Acomparisoncontrasts two or more products to\nshow the superiority of the advertiser’s brand. The\ncomparison can be direct, with competitors men-\ntioned, or indirect, with just a reference to “other\nleading brands.” In the comparison approach, as\nwith a demonstration, seeing is believing, so the\nobjective is to build conviction. When people see\ntwo products being compared, they are more likely\nto believe that one is better than the other.\n• In a problem solutionmessage,also known as\nproduct-as-hero,the message begins with a prob-\nlem and then showcases the product as the solu-\ntion. Avariation is the problem avoidance\nmessageformat, in which the product helps the\nconsumer avoid a problem.\n• Humorcan be a useful creative strategy—using a co-\nmedian such as Jerry Seinfeld as the star, for example\n(see Chapter 7, p. 209)—because it grabs attention\nSHOWCASE and is memorable. Planners hope people will transfer\nThe “Truck Stop” headline for D&A uses a twist to make the repair the warm feelings of being entertained to the product.\nshop the hero.
