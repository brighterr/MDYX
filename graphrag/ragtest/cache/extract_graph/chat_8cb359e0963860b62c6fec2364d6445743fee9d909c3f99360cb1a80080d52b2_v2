Similar to a radio script,\natelevision scriptis the written version of the commercial’s plan. It contains all the words, dialogue,\nlyrics (if important to the ad message), instructions, and descriptions of the details we’ve been\ndiscussing—sets, costumes, lighting, and so forth. For television commercials that use dialogue, the\nscript is written in two columns, with the audio on the right and the video on the left.\n282 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nThe key to the structure of a television script is the relationship between the audio and the\nvideo. The dialogue is typed as usual, but the instructions and labels are typed in all-capital let-\nters. The video part of the script includes descriptions of key frames, characters, actions, and cam-\nera movements in the commercial. Sometimes the script is in a two-column format with the video\ninstructions on the left and the audio in the right column.\nAstoryboard,which is a visual plan or layout of the commercial, is drawn (by hand or on\nthe computer) to show the number of scenes, composition of the shots, and progression of the ac-\ntion. The script information usually appears below the key images. Its purpose is to guide the film-\ning. Aphotoboarduses photographic stills instead of art to illustrate the progression of images.\nIt’s created from the still photos or frames from the filming and is used to present to clients. (See\nthe Frontier commercial in Chapter 8.)\nHOW DIFFERENT IS COPYWRITING FOR THE INTERNET?\nThe Internet is more interactive than any other mass medium. Not only do viewers initiate the\ncontact, they can send e-mail on many websites. This makes Web advertising more like two-way\ncommunication, and that’s a major point of difference from other advertising forms. As a result,\nthe Web copywriter is challenged to attract people to the site and to manage a dialogue-based\ncommunication experience. In addition to targeting messages to audiences, Web advertisers have\nto be prepared to listen and respond to those audiences. That’s a major shift in how Web market-\ning communicators think about advertising.\nPrinciple Itistrue,however,thatthereareformsofInternetadvertisingthatlooklikemoretraditional\nTo write great copy for the ads,suchasbanners,sidebarads,andpopups.E-mailandvideoads,aswellasmobileadsonsmart\nWeb, copywriters must phones,allrequirevariationsoftraditionalcopywritingtechniques.Mostoftheseformatsendwith\nthink of it as an interactive alinktothesponsor’swebsitewheretheusercanparticipateinamoreinteractiveexperience.\nmedium and open up In this complicated, fast-changing medium, there aren’t a lot of rules. In fact, marketing\nopportunities for dialogue\ncommunication that uses text messaging and Twitter may even throw out the rules of spelling with\nwith the consumer.\nvowel-free words. Cell-phone company Motorola follows that trend in naming new products such\nas RAZR, PEBL, and RCKR.\nFor banners and other formats that look like advertising and seek to attract someone to a com-\npany’s website, verbosity is a killer. In that situation, no one wants to read a lot of type online. That\nmeans Web copywriters have to be able to write everything from catchy phrases for banners to copy\nthat works like traditional advertisements, brochures, or catalogs. Abasic principle, however, is that\ngood writing is good writing, whether it is being done for traditional advertising media or for the Web.\nWebsites\nThe challenge for Web advertisers is to understand the user’s situation and design messages that\nfit their needs and interests. However, the Web is an information medium and users come to it, in\nsome cases, for reference information—formats that look a lot like catalogs, or even encyclope-\ndias. Corporate or organizational websites are designed to provide information, as well as image\ncues, so strategies that organize information and package it for easy accessibility are important.\nKey wordsare used to help visitors or surfers(rather than readers, listeners, or viewers) search\nfor the site online, as well as within the site for the information they need.\nCreativity is also valued both to entice visitors, but also to keep them actively involved with\nthe site. For example, the “Don’t Mess with Texas” anti-litter website mentioned early as an\nAdweekfavorite invites visitors into the campaign with advertising materials, testimonials, letters,\nspecial events, and involvement programs. It uses colorful animation to create action and spark in-\nterest. The language reflects the tough-talking slogan. For example, one section asks, “Who wants\nto live in a pig sty?” and “Why swim in an ashtray?” Check it out at http://dontmesswithtexas.org.\nBanners\nThemostcommonformofonlineadvertisingissmallbanneradscontainingtext,images,andper-\nhapsmotion(animation).Bannersinthissmallformathavetobecreativetostandoutamidstthe\nclutteronatypicalWebpageand,similartooutdooradvertising,theyhavetograbthesurfer’sat-\ntentionwithfewwords.Effectivebannersarousetheinterestoftheviewer,whoisoftenbrowsing\nthroughotherinformationonthecomputerscreen.Thekeytostoppingsurfersisvividgraphics,\nCHAPTER 9 • COPYWRITING 283\nmotion,andcleverphrases.Itiscriticaltomakethesiteeasytonavigate.Ingeneral,thecopywriter\nusesthesestrategiesforgrabbingsurfers\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
