What do you think?\nCan advertising manipulate people’s choices? Critics of advertising argue\nthat advertising can create social trends and has the power to dictate how people\nthink and act. They believe that even if an individual ad cannot control behavior,\nthe cumulative effects of nonstop television, radio, print, Internet, and outdoor\nads can be overwhelming. Others contend that effective brand communication\nspots trends and then develops messages that connect target audiences with the\ntrends. In other words, if people are interested in achieving healthy lifestyles, you\nwill see ads that use health appeals as an advertising strategy. In this way, ad-\nvertising mirrors values rather than sets them. Do you agree with that argument?\nOne example of using advertising to try to change society and improve the\nworld while still selling products is the RED campaign, instigated by U2 singer\nBono in conjunction with major companies like Apple, Gap, and Hallmark. The\npurpose of the campaign is to sell RED-branded products to help fight AIDS\nand HIVin Africa. Does Product RED advertising mirror a societal concern for\nAfricans’welfare or does it shape how we think about the problem, or both? An-\nother example of attempting to influence society is the award-winning “Open\nfor Business” poster that appeared after the 9/11 tragedy.\nThis shaping-versus-mirroring debate is the most central issue we address\nin considering advertising’s role in society. What drives consumers to behave or\nbelieve as they do? Is it advertising, or is it other forces? Why do women buy\ncosmetics, for example? Are they satisfying a deep cultural need for beauty, or\nwere they manipulated by advertising to believe in the hope that cosmetics of-\nfer? Women can even purchase a product by the cosmetics company Philoso-\nphy called Hope in a Jar. Or have their families and friends socialized them to\nbelieve they look better with cosmetics than without? Advertising and society’s\nvalues are probably interactive, so the answer to the debate may simply be that\nadvertising both mirrors and shapes values.\nOvercommercialization Does advertising lead people to be too materialistic?\nThe second half of the 20th century is notable for the rise of a materialistic con-\nsumer culture in the Western world. Did advertising create this culture, or does\nThe poster “America: Open for\nit simply reflect a natural striving for the good life?\nBusiness” is an example of a message\naimed at stimulating business after 9/11. Some argue that advertising heightens expectations and primes the audience\nThe RED campaign demonstrates a to believe that the answer is always a product. If you have a headache, what do you\ncollaborative effort by a number of do? You take a pill.

Consumers, however, are not always passively doing what advertisers tell\nthem. As we have said, they have the power to refuse to buy what is being sold.\nAnother facet of this debate relates to a problem that emerges if the walls blur between ad-\nvertising and news and entertainment. If advertising becomes intertwined with news, how will\naudiences know whether news stories are free from editorial pressure from sponsors who want to\ncontrol what is said about their brands? As product placement becomes increasingly prevalent,\nhow does that affect entertainment? Does the influence of advertising, for example, change how\nCHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY 67\nwe watch football games and other sporting events? Does it bother you that Coke has more than\n2,000 product placements in American Idol,especially when a lot of viewers are under 16?4\nOther Social Responsibility Issues\nTo help you understand issues that advertisers face when they can have a direct impact and make\na difference to society, we’ll discuss six key topics: (1) taste and offensive advertising, (2) sex ap-\npeals, (3) diversity issues, (4) message-related issues, (5) product-related issues, and (6) emerg-\ning issues with digital media. If you’re interested in these and other related topics, visit the\nAdvertising Educational Foundation website at www.aef.comfor more information.\nPoor Taste and Offensive Advertising Although certain ads might be in bad taste in any cir-\ncumstance, viewer reactions are affected by such factors as sensitivity to the product category,\ntiming (if the message is received in the middle of dinner, for example), and other circumstances,\nsuch as whether the person is alone or with others when viewing the message. Some television\nads, for example, might not bother adults watching alone but would make them uncomfortable if\nchildren were watching.\nAlso, questionable ads become offensive in the wrong context. Advertisers and media out-\nlets must try to be sensitive to such objections. Recently, outraged advertisers including Apple-\nbee’s, General Mills, and Kraft pulled ads from Fox News Channel’s Glenn Beckprogram after\nthe host called President Obama a “racist” with a “deep-seated hatred for white people.”5\nWe all have our own ideas about what constitutes good taste. Unfortunately, these ideas vary\nPrinciple\nso much that creating general guidelines for good taste in advertising is difficult.
