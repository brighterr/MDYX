Announcements for\ncents-off deals include the package itself and\nsigns near the product or elsewhere in the store.\nAdvertising for these deals include sales, flyers,\nnewspaper ads, and broadcast ads.\nMaintain or Increase Market Share In addi-\ntion to encouraging trial of a new product, an-\nother purpose of price deals is to convince\nprospective users to switch from an established\ncompeting brand, such as Cheetos in the King\nCorn case. Later, after the King Corn brand is es-\ntablished, a price deal can be used to reward\nloyal users and encourage their repeat business.\nPrice deals are particularly effective in those sit-\nuations where price is an important factor in\nbrand choice or if consumers are not brand loyal.\nTo maintain a brand’s presence, increase its\nmarket share, or counter competitive actions,\nmarketers use promotional tools such as\ncoupons, premiums, special events, and contests The Blue Bunny brochure uses strong appetite appeal in its visuals to\nand sweepstakes. The Blue Bunny brochure was emphasize the good taste of its low-carb and low-fat products and\nused as a Sunday newspaper supplement. It fea- coupons to encourage consumers to try the product line.\ntures the entire Indulge line of low-carb and low-\nfat products, as well as coupons to encourage trial.\nIn addition to serving as a reward for buying a product, premiums can enhance an advertis-\ning campaign or a brand’s image. Characters like the Campbell’s Soup Kids, Tony the Tiger,\nCap’n Crunch, and Ronald McDonald are used on premiums, such as soup or cereal bowls, to re-\ninforce the consumer’s association of the brand with the character. Cereal manufacturers are\namong the biggest users of in-pack premiums as reminder devices.\nBrand Reminder In addition to new product launches, promotions are also used in the reminder\nstage. This means that you change advertising copy to remind customers about the positive ex-\nperience they had with the product and use sales promotion to reinforce their loyalty with\ncoupons, rebates, and other rewards. After the initial purchase you want the customer to remem-\nber the brand and repeat the purchase, so specialty items, such as a King Corn snack bowl, can\nserve as a brand reminder. Specialty advertising serves as a reminder to the consumer to consider\nthe product. Specialties also build relationships, such as items given away as New Year or thank-\nyou gifts (the calendar hanging in the kitchen). Advertisers use specialty items to thank customers\nfor patronage, to reinforce established products or services, and to generate sales leads.\nTRADE PROMOTIONS\nConsumer awareness and desire mean nothing unless King Corn is available where the consumer\nthinks it should be. Somehow the trade must be convinced that the product will move off the\nshelves. Marketers know they must engage the trade in the program if their consumer promotions\n528 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nSHOWCASE\nThese kits were sent by Kuni Automotive to the smart car company to win dealerships in three cities.

Kuni “needed\nsomething that would stand out and give them instant name recognition with the people at smart.”\nThe idea was to send a set of kits before sending the official paperwork proposal. “They were all\nshrink wrapped.
