For ex-\nample, a study by the Radio Ad Effectiveness Lab reported that recall of advertising is enhanced when\na mix of radio and Internet ads are used rather than just website advertising alone.25Astudy published\nin the Journal of Advertising Researchdeveloped a multidimensional approach based on evaluation\nof four factors including unified and consistent communication, strategic consistency in targeting\n(different messages for different audiences), database communication, and relationship programs.26\nSuch studies of both the platforms and components of IMC are beginning to tease out the effects of\nsynergy, but they are a long way from evaluating the effects of a total communication program.\nThe most common way of measuring a campaign’s total impact is the brand tracking ap-\nproach mentioned previously. As various ingredients in the campaign are added and taken away,\nchanges in tracking study results can show the effects and help identify what combinations of\nmarketing communication functions and media work best for a brand. In other words, has the\nbrand become stronger on critical dimensions of the image, such as personality and positioning\ncues, because of the campaign?\nAcomplication in evaluating programs is the need to consider other messages and contact\npoints beyond traditional marketing communication. As we have said, in a 360-degree total com-\nmunication program, brand experiences, such as those involved with customer service and WoM,\nmay be even more important than traditional marketing communication. A Principled Practice\nfeature by Professor Keith Murray demonstrates how these unconventional message effects can\nbe measured.\nConnecting the Dots The challenge in campaign and program evaluation is to pull everything\ntogether and look at the big picture of campaign performance rather than the individual pieces\nand parts. One of the first places to start is defining the objectives—all the various effects—and\nthen adequately and realistically measure the campaign’s performance against those objectives.\nHere’s an example that demonstrates how evaluation methods can be matched to the original cam-\npaign objectives.\nEffie award winner UPS wanted to reposition itself by broadening its package delivery im-\nage.27Although UPS owned ground delivery, it lost out to Federal Express in the overnight and\ninternational package market. UPS knew from its customer research that to break out of the\n“brown and ground” perception, the company had to overcome the inertia of shipping managers\nwho use UPS for ground packages and FedEx for overnight and international. The company also\nhad to shift the perception of senior executives from a company that handles packages to a strate-\ngic partner in systems planning. From these insights came three sets of objectives that focused on\n600 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nA PRINCIPLED PRACTICE\nCan a Broken Guitar Really Hurt United?\nKeith Murray,Associate Dean, College of Business, Bryant University\nIt’s been a YouTube hit and pares the percent of this lost revenue against UA’s\nmade the e-mail rounds sales revenue in 2008.\nfor a long time—the\n“United Breaks Gui- # of $500 Trips Percent of Viewers Influenced by\ntars” video.
