Spammers solicit business from sources like AOL’s profiles where\npeople indicate their interests and activities. Aspammer might send out 100,000 e-mails and get\nonly two to five clients, which seems like a totally unacceptable number of responses. But a spam-\nmer who charges $300 to send out 100,000 messages or $900 for a million might make $14,000\nto $15,000 on those few responses. That’s not a bad return when you consider the cost of getting\ninto the business—a computer and an Internet connection.\nHere are some of the ways consumers can reduce the amount of unwanted direct mail or\nspam they receive:15\n• If you enter a contest or order an item by mail, you may wind up on a mailing list. To protect\nyour contact information, check the “opt-out” box and write “No mailing lists” beside your\ncontact information.\n• Use the “Contact Us” link on retailers’websites to ask to be taken off mailing lists.\n• Check the “Privacy” link at the bottom of a company’s home page for directions on remov-\ning your name from its mailing lists.\n• The Mail Preference Service of DMApermits you to register for $5 to get off mailing lists\n(www.dmaconsumers.org/cgi/offmailing).\nCHAPTER 16 • DIRECT RESPONSE 505\n• To get off credit card solicitation lists, call 888-5-OPT-OUT. Arecorded message will ask for\nyour contact information, but that’s just confirmation. This service already has your contact\ninformation; providing it by phone confirms your identity so your request can be processed.\n• To register for the federal do-not-call list, go to donotcall.govand sign up. That will cut\ndown on unwanted phone calls from marketers.\n• To reduce the amount of spam you receive, register at e-MPS, which is DMA’s e-mail Pref-\nerence Service (http://dmaconsumers.org/consumers/optoutform_emps.shtml).\nYou might note that in most cases, if you have a relationship with a company—which means\nyou’ve ordered something within the past 12 months—you won’t be deleted from those lists.\nBlanket requests to end unsolicited calls or mail may not apply to charities and politicians be-\ncause of First Amendment issues. Nonprofit organizations do a lot of solicitations by mail.\nPermission Marketing Because spam is a huge problem for legitimate e-mail marketers, they Principle\nare now using an approach called permission marketing.This approach attempts to address the Opt-in and opt-out\nspam problem by asking potential consumers for their permission to send them e-mail. Solutions strategies make e-mail\nto the problem usually incorporate one of two permission marketing strategies for consumers to campaigns more\ncontrol their inclusion on lists. Opt inmeans that all bulk mailers have to get your permission be- acceptable because\nfore sending a promotion. Legitimate direct marketers use this permission form, which is tougher customers give permission\nfor spammers to abuse and more sensitive to consumer rage when they do. Opt outmeans that to marketers to contact\nthem. At the heart of\ne-mailers can send the first e-mail but must give recipients the means to refuse any further e-mails\npermission marketing is the\nfrom that business. These options give customers control over the amount and type of e-mail mes-\nidea that every customer\nsages they receive, and companies reduce wasted resources on marketing to uninterested indi-\nwho opts in to a campaign\nviduals. The concept at the heart of permission marketing is that every customer who opts in to a\nis a qualified lead.\ncampaign is a qualified lead.\nWHY ARE DATABASES THE FOUNDATION OF DMC?\nLooking back, you’ll note that Figures 16.1and 16.2both begin with databases. Why is that so? Di-\nrect marketers use databasesto keep track of current customers and identify prospective customers.\nThey are also a segmentation tool to communicate relevant offers to customers and prospects. An-\nother benefit for companies that keep track of their customers’online behavior is that they are bet-\nter able to personalize their DMC messages. Adatabase is at the heart of direct marketing.\nFor example, consider how Carnival Cruise Lines uses databases to manage its customer re-\nlationships. Information is gathered at check-in when customers get their Sail & Sign card, which\nserves as money on the cruise (it also allows Carnival to track its customers’purchases and activ-\nities). New customers receive a standard card but returning passengers get a gold card that triggers\n“Welcome back” messages from staff. Frequent cruisers get a platinum card and automatic mem-\nbership in the Concierge Club with perks such as priority embarking and debarking, dining times,\nand spa reservations. These data are then used to target follow-up e-mail and direct-mail offers.\nThe authors of a set of books that focus on one-to-one marketing defined it as a strategy that\ndelivers customer-focused objectives by treating different customers differently. Through the use\nof databases, they describe the learning relationshipthat results from customer dialogue. Here is\nhow this data-driven relationship works:16\nIf you’re my customer and I get you to talk to me, I remember what you tell me, and I get\nsmarter and smarter about you. I know something about you competitors don’t know. So I\ncan do things for you my competitors can’t do, because they don’t know you as well as I\ndo. Before long, you can get something from me you can’t get anywhere else, for any price.\nAt the very least you’d have to start all over somewhere else, but starting over is more costly\nthan staying with us.\nAnexampleofusingadatabasetoidentifygoodcustomersandt\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
