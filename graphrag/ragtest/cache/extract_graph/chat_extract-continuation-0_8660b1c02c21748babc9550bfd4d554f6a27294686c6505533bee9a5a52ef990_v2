By one account, Aflac spent a poultry, scratch that, paltry sum\nof $45 million on television advertising annually. Compare that to McDonald’s\n$680 million annual ad budget, which supports Ronald McDonald, or Energizer,\nwhose company has plunked down about $1 billion on its Bunny advertising dur-\ning the past 35 years. So, the duck has been quite a bargain in terms of getting\nattention.\nThe spokesfowl is not without his problems, however. It seems that the duck\ngets all the attention. Everyone knows it as an advertising icon, but customers\ndon’t know what it sells. The next generation of ducky advertising is addressing\nthat very problem.\n353\n354 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nAflac has switched agencies to Zimmerman in Tallahassee, Florida, part of the\nOmnicom Group, who is building on the brand’s identity by using the duck to trans-\nform brand identification into brand education. The agency is using both new and\ntraditional media. If you looked, you would have seen the duck on billboards in\nTimes Square along with this odd Web address: youdontknowquack.com.The mul-\ntimedia campaign featured newspaper ads and television commercials during the\nWinter Olympics to direct people to another Web address for more information. It\nalso featured full-page ads in newspapers, such as the Wall Street Journal.\nThe ad was a teaser ad in that the sponsor was unidentified (unless the duck\ngave it away). The ad relied on reader curiosity to get people to visit the Aflac site,\nwhich opened with a quiz that tested common knowledge. On television the an-\nnouncer says, “If all you know about us is . . .” when he’s interrupted by the duck\nquacking, “Aflac!” The announcer then continues, “. . . then you don’t know quack.\nTo find out all the ways Aflac’s got you covered, visit knowquack.com.”\nThe efforts to build the brand continue with variety of 45 elements in addition\nto the traditional print, outdoor, and TV already mentioned, including a Facebook\nand YouTube presence, trivia questions on TV, a line of duck clothing, a Quack en-\nergy drink, video clips called “duckumentaries,” commercials on NBC’s Winter\nOlympics, and a NASCAR race car showing the duck’s image and using the “You\nDon’t Know Quack” theme.\nTurn to the It’s a Wrapsection at the end of the chapter to learn more about\nhow this effective campaign got consumers to know more about Aflac than quack.\nSources:Aflac Corporate Citizenship Report 2009,www.aflac.com/us/en/docs/investors/CSRReport.pdf;Susan Vranica,\n“Creativity on the Cheap: Aflac Duck’s Paddle to Stardom,” the Wall Street Journal,July 30, 2004; Stuart Elliott, “Not\nDaffy or Donald, But Still Aflac’s Rising Star,” the New York Times,April 22, 2009, www.nytimes.com;Stuart Elliott, “Aflac\nIs Leaving Its Agency, and Taking the Duck,” the New York Times,January 22, 2010, www.nytimes.com;Rupal Parekh,\n“Brand Awareness Was Only Half the Battle for Aflac,” http://adage.com,June 22, 2009; James Wisdom, “Case Study: A\nMarketing Icon’s Facebook Journey,” October 13, 2009, imediaconnection.com; Noreen O’Leary, “Aflac Spots ‘Quack’\nWise,” January 22, 2010, www.adweek.com;“Aflac Case Study,” March 3, 2010, kaplanthaler.com.\nThe Aflac campaign has been successful because of its use of television to dramatize a funny sit-\nuation where the Aflac duck tries to get the attention of people needing supplemental insurance.\nMore recently it has used print and outdoor advertising with strong duck graphics to announce a\nnew strategy that proclaims “You Don’t Know Quack” about what Aflac offers. These teaser ads\nare designed to drive traffic to the website where you can find everything you need to know about\nsupplemental insurance.\nIn this chapter, we explore the uses, structure, audiences, and advantages and disadvantages\nof traditional media such as print, which includes newspapers and magazines; out-of-home me-\ndia; and finally broadcast media, which includes radio and television. We also review film and\nvideo formats that are used in campaigns.\nWHAT ARE THE KEY PRINT MEDIA CHARACTERISTICS?\nPrint media vehicles include newspapers, magazines, brochures, and other printed surfaces, such\nas posters and outdoor boards. Although it is true that magazines and newspapers, especially, have\nexpanded their message delivery online, billions of dollars are still spent on traditional print me-\ndia. That is what this section is all about.\nPrinciple\nIn terms of impact, print media generally provide more information, rich imagery, and a\nPrint media generally\nlonger message life than broadcast media. It’s an information-rich environment so, in terms of our\nprovide more information,\nFacets of Effects Model, print media are often used to generate cognitive responses.
