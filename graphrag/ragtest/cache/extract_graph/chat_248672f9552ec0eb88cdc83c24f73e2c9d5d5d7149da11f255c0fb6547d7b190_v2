It looks like your loyal brand users are reducing their\npurchases at the same time Sweet ‘n Crunchy customers are increasing their purchases. It may\neven be that some of your customers are switching over to Sweet ’n Crunchy. Astrategy based on\nthis information might be to convince people that your brand tastes better and to remind your\nloyal customers of the reasons they have preferred your brand. Those goals can be accomplished\nby marketing communication.\nWhen you combine the two pieces of information and think about it, another insight might\nexplain this situation. Perhaps people are simply eating fewer cookies. If that’s a problem, then\nthe communication opportunity lies in convincing people to return to eating cookies. That is more\nof a category sellproblem (sell cookies) rather than a competitive sell(set the brand against the\ncompetition). In the Choco Nuts example, it would take more research to know which situation\napplies here. Here’s a summary of these two different strategic approaches.\nCompetitive/Brand Sell Category Sell\nWhat? Challenger brand Leader brand\nWho? Loyal buyers Medium/light/lapsed buyers\nWhat effect? Compare cookie brands Compare against other snacks\nObjective? Increase share of wallet Increase total category sales\nMessage? “Our cookies are better “Cookies are better than candy\nthan theirs” or salty snacks”\nThe important dimensions account planners seek to understand in planning brand strategies\ninclude relationship, perceptions, promise, and point of differentiation. Most importantly, plan-\nners are looking for clues about the brand’s meaning, which is usually phrased in terms of the\nbrand essence (core, soul), personality, or image, as the SeaPort outdoor boards illustrate.\nThe Communication Brief\nThe outcome of strategic research usually reaches agency creative departments in the form of a\nstrategy document called a communication brieforcreative brief,which explains the consumer\ninsight and summarizes the basic strategy decisions. Although the exact form of this document\ndiffers from agency to agency and from advertiser to advertiser, the brief is an outline of the mes-\nsage strategy that guides the creative team and helps keep its ideas strategically sound. As the\nplanner’s main product, it should be clear, logical, and focused. Here is an outline of a typical\ncommunication brief:\n• ProblemWhat’s the problem that communication can solve? (establish position, reposition,\nincrease loyalty, get people involved, increase liking, etc.)\n• Target AudienceTo whom do we want to speak? (brand loyal, heavy users, infrequent users,\ncompetition’s users, etc.)\nCHAPTER 7 • STRATEGIC PLANNING 215\nSHOWCASE\nThese outdoor boards are for SeaPort Airlines,\nwhich serves Seattle, Juneau, Portland, and\nother West Coast cities. They make a\nstatement about the SeaPort target\naudience—influential business travelers—\nand their lifestyle.\nThese ads were contributed by Karl\nSchroeder, copywriter at Coates Kokes in\nPortland, Oregon. A graduate\nof the University of Oregon\nadvertising program, he\nwas nominated by\nProfessor Charles Frazer.\n• Consumer InsightsWhat motivates the target? What are the “major truths” about the target’s\nrelationship to the product category or brand?\n• Brand ImperativesWhat are the important features? What’s the point of competitive ad-\nvantage? What’s the brand’s position relative to the competition? Also, what’s the brand\nessence, personality, and/or image. Ogilvy & Mather says, “What is the unique personality\nfor the brand? People use products, but they have relationships with brands.”\n• Communication ObjectivesWhat do we want customers to do in response to our messages?\n(perception, knowledge, feelings, symbolic meanings, attitudes and conviction, action)\n• The Proposition or Selling IdeaWhat is the single thought that the communication will\nbring to life in a provocative way?\n• SupportWhat is the reason to believe the proposition? Ogilvy & Mather explains, “We need\nto give consumers ‘permission to believe’—something that allows them to rationalize,\nwhether to themselves or others, what is in reality an emotionally driven brand decision. The\nsupport should be focused on the insight or proposition, the truths that make the brand bene-\nfit indisputable.”\n• CreativeDirectionHowcanwebeststimulatethedesiredresponse?Howcanwebestsayit?\n• Media ImperativesWhere and when should we say it?\nSource:This outline was compiled from one contributed by Susan Mendelsohn, as well as from the creative brief outline\ndeveloped by the Ogilvy agency and presented on its website (www.ogilvy.com).\n216 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nThe brief is strategic, but it also should be inspirational. It is designed to ignite the creative\nteam and give a spark to their idea process. Agood brief doesn’t set up limitations and boundaries\nbut rather serves as a springboard. It is the first step in the creative process. Charlie Robertson,\nan account planner and brand consultant, likens the brief to a fire starter: “The match is the brief,\nthe ignition is the inspiring dialogue [in the briefing], and the flare is the creative.”27\nPLANNING FOR IMC CAMPAIGNS\nAnIMCplanfollowsthesamebasicoutlineasanadvertisingplan.Thedifference,however,lies\nwiththescopeoftheplanandthevarietyofmarketingcommunicationareasinvolvedintheef-\nfort.
