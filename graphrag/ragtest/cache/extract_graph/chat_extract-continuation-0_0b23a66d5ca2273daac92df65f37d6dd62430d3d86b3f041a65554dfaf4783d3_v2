Its biggest marketing challenge is to generate in-\nquiries for rate quotes and to motivate people to call or go online to find out\nhow they can save money, which is reflected in its long-standing brand promise,\n“15 minutes could save you 15 percent or more on car insurance.”\nThebirthofTheGecko(that’shiswholename)occurredin1999asadhonchos\natTheMartinAgencylaboredoverwhattodowithanaccounttheyhadforGEICO,\nan acronym for the not-so-catchy-sounding Government Employees Insurance\nCompany. One member of the creative team noted that customers often mispro-\nnounced“GEICO”as“Gecko,”andsomeonedrewadoodleofthelittleguy.\nThe Gecko tells fundamental truths about the human condition in goofy ways.\nThe oddball humor caught on with the audience, although Ted Ward, vice presi-\ndent for marketing for GEICO, admits he didn’t immediately fall in love with the lit-\ntle guy. Ward said, “I quickly became much more fond of him as we sold more\npolicies. I’m a big fan of anything that makes our phone ring or website click. He\nreally has helped us brandwise.”\nTed Ward described the business: “We have essentially a direct-to-consumer\nbusiness model. We try to strip out costs to deliver the lowest price—which in-\ncludes having very few agents in a process by having a superior technology model,\nwhich back in the ‘70s was direct mail; in the ‘80s and ‘90s, a telephone; and in the\nlast 10 years, the online delivery of rates.”\nIt’s not just GEICO’s endearing icon that makes the campaign work. GEICO\nuses The Gecko strategically to accomplish the work that its rival auto insurers do\nby hiring an army of sales middlemen.\n487\n488 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nYou may have noticed that GEICO doesn’t just stick with The Gecko in all of its\ncommercials. The reason has much to do with the size of the market, which includes\njust about anyone who drives a car. Realizing that one creative approach will not\nappeal to everyone, GEICO uses a diverse approach to reach a wide audience.\nThat means The Gecko appeals to some, while the indignant Cavemen capture\nothers’ attention, and customer testimonials with celebrities like Little Richard\nreach even others. Another twist is a campaign dubbed “Rhetorical Questions”\nthat doesn’t feature any of the company’s mascots. Instead commercials ask rhetor-\nical questions, such as “Does Elmer Fudd have trouble with the letter R?” and “Did\nThe Waltonstake way too long to say goodnight?”\nLessonslearned?Theconceptissimple:differentstrokesfordifferentfolks.The\ndifferentcreativeapproachesareGEICO-izedbyusingacommonhumoroustone.\nIf it’s true that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, you can see the effect\nGEICO’s advertising has had on the industry. Watch competitors’ like State Farm\nand Allstate, which have advertised for years with gentle, homespun messages pro-\nmoting family and security. They are now including more humor, high action, and\nother attention-getting techniques to make you remember their brand when it\ncomes time to buy auto insurance.\nJust how successful are The Gecko and his pals’ efforts to sell insurance?

Marketers use direct marketing in every consumer and business-to-\nbusiness (B2B) category. IBM, Xerox, and other manufacturers selling office products use direct-\nresponse marketing communication, as do almost all banks and insurance companies. Airlines,\nhotels, and cruise lines use it. Packaged-goods marketers such as General Foods, Colgate, and\nBristol Myers; household product marketers such as Black and Decker; and automotive compa-\nnies use it. Direct marketing shows up in membership drives, fund-raising, and solicitation for\ndonations by nonprofit organizations such as the Sierra Club and Audubon Society and by polit-\nical associations, so it is also used by other marcom tools, such as public relations.\nIn this chapter we will discuss the practice and process of direct-response marketing com-\nmunication (DMC), the key players, the tools of direct marketing, and the principles of integrat-\ning direct marketing into the total brand communication effort.\nWHAT IS DIRECT-RESPONSE MARKETING COMMUNICATION?\nWhy do you suppose marketers continue to use “junk mail” that fills up\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GEICO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GEICO, an acronym for Government Employees Insurance Company, is a major insurance company known for its humorous advertising campaigns and direct-to-consumer business model)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE GECKO<|>PERSON<|>The Gecko is a mascot for GEICO, created in 1999, known for its humorous and relatable advertising style)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TED WARD<|>PERSON<|>Ted Ward is the vice president for marketing at GEICO, who appreciates the impact of The Gecko on sales and branding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE MARTIN AGENCY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Martin Agency is the advertising agency responsible for creating The Gecko for GEICO)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATE FARM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>State Farm is a competitor of GEICO, known for its traditional advertising but has started incorporating humor and high action)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLSTATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allstate is a competitor of GEICO, traditionally promoting family and security but now using more humor in its advertising)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEICO<|>THE GECKO<|>The Gecko is a mascot for GEICO, used in its advertising campaigns to attract customers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEICO<|>TED WARD<|>Ted Ward is the vice president for marketing at GEICO, overseeing the impact of The Gecko on sales<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEICO<|>THE MARTIN AGENCY<|>The Martin Agency created The Gecko for GEICO's advertising campaigns<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEICO<|>STATE FARM<|>State Farm is a competitor of GEICO, influenced by GEICO's advertising style<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEICO<|>ALLSTATE<|>Allstate is a competitor of GEICO, influenced by GEICO's advertising style<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
