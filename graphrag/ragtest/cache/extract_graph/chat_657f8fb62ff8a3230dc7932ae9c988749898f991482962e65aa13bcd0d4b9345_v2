Sophisticated managers understand this and try to\nmanage their communication programs so all the messages work together to create Preston’s co-\nherent brand perception.\nThe Subliminal Issue Before we leave the perception category, let’s consider the controversial\narea of subliminal effects. subliminaleffects are message cues given below the threshold of per-\nception. In other words, they don’t register. As Professor Sheri Broyles explains in the A Matter\nof Principle feature, “By definition, subliminal means the stimulus is below your threshold of\nconsciousness. The first thing to know is if you can see something, then it isn’t subliminal.” The\nidea is that subliminal messages are designed to get past your perceptual filters by talking directly\nto your subconscious. People who believe in subliminal advertising presume such messages to be\nintense enough to influence behavior and they consider it to be unfair manipulation of unaware\nviewers. Broyles describes the research and thinking about the idea that unseen messages can be\ncommunicated in advertising in the A Matter of Principlefeature.\nThe Emotional or Affective Facet: Feel\nDoyouhavefavoritebrandsthatyoulike—anddidadvertisinghaveanythingtodowithwhyyou\nlikethatbrand?Canyourememberanyadsthatyoulikedandwhyyoulikedthem?Affectivere-\nsponsesmirrorourfeelingsaboutsomething.Thetermaffectivedescribessomethingthatstimu-\nlateswants,touchestheemotions,establishesamood,createsliking,andelicitsfeelings.†\nIn the Part 2 opener, Regina Lewis emphasized the importance of emotional connections for\nsuccessful brands.

She explains, “During tough times, brands that are able to lift the\nmood through their communications are rewarded.” But it’s more than just cheery messages; she\nalso notes that certain types of emotional messages have more resonance: “Nostalgic brands that\ngive people a sense of tradition and security tend to thrive.”\nFeelings and emotions can be positive—or negative. Generally, marketing communication\nseeks to wrap a positive halo around a brand and a purchase decision.

Though\nhe later admitted these results were a hoax, it was as if\nPandora had let subliminal advertising out of her box.
