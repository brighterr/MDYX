Rather than tangible features like these, Sheraton decided\nto emphasize the emotional side of traveling and shows people greeting one another. Since it’s a\nglobal company, the greetings include hugs, bows, and kisses on both cheeks. The company believes\nthat its customers worldwide like to be welcomed, appreciated, and made to feel at home.\nPlanners search for the best creative strategy—the approach that makes the most sense given the\nbrand’s marketing situation and the target audience’s needs and interests.
