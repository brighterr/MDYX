Here is where media\nplanning and message planning intersect. Brand reminders, for example, are often found in tele-\nvision commercials and in OOH media. More complex information-laden messages are more\nlikely to be found in magazines, direct mail, or publicity releases. If you want to stimulate im-\nmediate action, you might use daily newspapers, radio, or sales promotion.\nWith the increasing push into digital media, the chief marketing officer at a digital media com-\npany reminds planners that “Brand advertising is about telling a story, not just directing traffic.”\n446 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nTheAtlantic Monthly\nmagazine used a\nmultiplatform\ncampaign that\nintegrated messages\nfrom neon signs to\ncreate an event that\nwas filmed for videos\nthat were seen on a\nwebsite.\nHe calls for refocusing on media basics: “Interactivity has given us new options to tell a story, so-\ncial media have given us tools to make it spread, and digital more broadly has forced advertisers\nto consider utility to the user.” But he insists: “The basics persist—find paths to the consumers\nwhere you can get scale, buy attention, and repeat.”13\nThe challenge is to create cross-media integration, which means the various media work to-\ngether to create coherent brand communication. Planners seek to create a synergistic effect be-\ntween the messages delivered in different media. In traditional media, this is sometimes called\nimage transferand refers to the way radio, in particular, reinforces and re-creates the message in\na listener’s mind that was originally delivered by other media, particularly TV.\nAn example of cross-media integration comes from the revitalization campaign for the Atlantic\nMonthlymagazine. To reinforce its position as an intellectual leader, the campaign used the slogan:\n“Think. Again.” To bring that idea to life, the campaign presented 14 of Atlantic’smost thought-\nprovoking questions as 14 huge neon signs placed around New York. At night the creative team\ntaped interviews with viewers as they wondered about the brightly lit messages. These videos,\nwhich showcased the personal, profound, and sometimes hilarious responses, were housed on a\nwebsite and used as a hub for a debate of these great issues. So it was OOH marketing that created\nan event that turned into videos that enlivened a website (see http://thinkagain.theatlantic.com). In\nthis case, to quote media scholar Marshall McLuhan, media became the message. Was it success-\nful? The magazine saw a double-digit increase in readership and the number of visitors to\nTheAtlantic.comincreased by 27 percent over the previous year.\nGlobal Media Planning\nAdvertising practitioners can debate global theories of advertising, but one fact is inescapable: a true\nglobal medium does not currently exist, which means global media plans have to piece together\nworldwide coverage using a variety of media tools. Television can transmit the Olympics around\nthe globe, but no one network controls this global transmission. An advertiser seeking global expo-\nsure, therefore, must deal with different networks and different vehicles in different countries.\nSatellite transmission now places advertising into many homes, but its availability is not uni-\nversal because of the footprint(coverage area of the satellite), technical limitations, and regula-\ntions of transmission by various governments. Satellites beam signals to more than one country\nin Europe, the Asian subcontinent, North America, and the Pacific, but they are regional, not\nglobal, in coverage. Despite its regional limitation, satellite transmission is still an enormous fac-\ntor in the changing face of international advertising. Star TV, with an audience spanning 38 coun-\ntries, including Egypt, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Russia’s Asian provinces, reaches a market of\nsome 2.7 billion people. It is closely followed by CNN and ESPN. Sky Channel, a U.K.-based\nCHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 447\nnetwork, offers satellite service to most of Europe, giving advertisers the opportunity to deliver a\nunified message across the continent.\nThe North American, European, Asian, and Latin American markets are becoming saturated\nwith cable TVcompanies offering an increasing number of international networks. Such broad-\ncasters include the hugely successful Latin American networks of Univision and Televisa, whose\nbroadcasts can be seen in nearly every Spanish-speaking market, including the United States. One\nof Univision’s most popular programs, Sabado Giganta, is seen by tens of millions of viewers in\n16 countries.\nHOW DOES MEDIA BUYING WORK?\nSo far in this chapter, you’ve read about media plans and the key steps you would take to develop\na media plan, and you looked at some important big picture issues related to media planning.
