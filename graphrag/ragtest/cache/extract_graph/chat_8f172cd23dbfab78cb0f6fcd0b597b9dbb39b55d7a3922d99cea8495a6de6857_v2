Other information uncovered in that research was useful in identifying key media\ncharacteristics of the target market. In particular, Ingvi Logason’s research found the following:\n• The target group members are the largest consumers of TVin the country.\n• Close to 100 percent of the target group has high-speed Internet access and are frequent\nusers of the Internet at work and at home.\n• Iceland most likely has the highest penetration of Facebook users in the world: 94 percent of\nthe population in the age group of 25- to 40-year-olds (the lamb industry’s target group)\nhave Facebook accounts.\nLogason explained that his agency created “an interactive media plan that would connect\nwith our target group in settings where they could be engaged in the ads. We would connect with\nthem on their leisure time where they worked, at home, and in social settings.” The plan used both\ntelevision and Facebook. He explains, “The strength of self-dissemination and friend referrals on\nFacebook made sure the ad recipes traveled far and wide with recommendation that the person\nposting the recipe liked it. Astrong connection was created between viral ads, the Lamb indus-\ntry’s website, and a Facebook group interested in lamb.”\nTraditionalmedia,suchastelevision,werealsousedbuttheinteractivemedia“allowedus\ntofocusonreachintheTVmediabuywhilewewereabletoobtainhighfrequencythroughviral\nmedia.”AdditionalactivitiesincludedsponsoringTVcookingshows,placingtheproductinTV\nshows(cookingandother),andgatheringvariouslambrecipesalreadyonlineandlinkingthem\nto the Facebook site. Logason reported that media measurements showed that the unorthodox\nmediamixreacheditstargetforbothreach(mostlythroughTV)andfrequency(mostlythrough\nviralactivities).\nIntrusiveness Because of the high level of commercial message clutter, companies in the past\nhave valued all of the help they can get in attracting attention to their messages. Intrusiveness—\nthe ability of a medium to grab attention by being disruptive or unexpected—is the primary strat-\negy for countering clutter. Kelley in the Part 4 opener pointed out that in the new media world,\nengagement will replace interruption. But still, most media use intrusiveness to some degree as a\nway to grab the attention of inattentive media consumers.\nMedia, as well as messages, vary in their degree of intrusiveness. The most intrusive medium\nPrinciple\nis personal selling because the sales representative’s presence demands attention. Likewise a\nThemoreintrusivea\nmedium,themoreitcan phone call is also demanding and a loud voice or sound on television can be irritating. The least\nbepersonalized,butalso intrusive media are print media because users choose when and to what extent to use these me-\nthemorecostlyitistouse. dia and attend to them. The more intrusive a medium, generally speaking, the more it can be per-\nsonalized, but also the more costly it is to use, which is why personal selling is so much more\ncostly than mass media. Admittedly, the word intrusivehas negative connotations. If a message\nis too disruptive or irritating, it may not help build a positive brand relationship.\nTherearewaystominimizeintrusiveness.Oneistochoosemediawhosetargetaudienceisin-\ntrinsicallyinterestedintheproductcategory.Researchhasshownthatoneofthebenefitsofspe-\ncializedmagazinesisthatreadersenjoylearningaboutnewproductsfromtheadvertising.Tohave\nvisibilitywithoutbeingintrusiveisoneofthereasonswhyproductplacementsandeventsarepop-\nular.Givingcustomersopt-inoropt-outoptionsforreceivingbrandinformationdigitallymeansthat\nwhenmessagesaresent,theyarenotunexpectedandthereforelesslikelytobeseenasintrusive.\nCHAPTER 11 • MEDIA BASICS 337\nHOW IS THE MEDIA ENVIRONMENT CHANGING?\nAs we said at the beginning of this chapter, marketing communication media are in an incredible\nstate of flux, partially because of the introduction of the computer and the Internet, but also be-\ncause of the way people choose to spend their time. Bruce Bendinger, formerly a creative direc-\ntor and now publisher of advertising books, analyzes the changing media environment in the\nA Matter of Practicefeature.\nIMC and Media\nWe have talked about the connection role of media. Adimension that is particularly important in\nIMC is creating, sustaining, and strengthening brand relationshipsover time. Relevant messages\ndelivered through media that drive positive experiences create value for consumers. This value\nadds up over time and emerges as loyalty—the ultimate goal of relationship marketing programs.\nRelationship marketing, a concept that originated with public relations, shifts the focus\nfrom the objective of getting a one-time purchase by a target to the maintenance of long-term in-\nvolvement from all of the firm’s critical stakeholders, whether employees, distributors, channel\nmembers, customers, agencies, investors, government agencies, the media, or community mem-\nbers. All stakeholders are seen as communicators who can send either positive or negative mes-\nsages about the brand; therefore, it is important to keep in contact with them and keep them\ninformed about brand programs (see Figure 11.3\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
