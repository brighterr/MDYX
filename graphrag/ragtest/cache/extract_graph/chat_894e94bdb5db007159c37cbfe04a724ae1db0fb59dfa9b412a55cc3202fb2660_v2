We know from the communica-\ntion model presented in Chapter 4that messages move through channels of communication.So\nin this sense, media delivermessages. In traditional mass media this is a one-way process from\nthe source (the advertiser) to the receiver (consumers).\nIn another sense, media are interactive because they offer opportunities for dialogue and\ntwo-way conversation. The media of marketing communication deliver messages to and from\ncustomers and move messages back and forth through channels. This refines the concept of de-\nlivery to include receiving and listening, as well as delivering messages. Jugenheimer explains\nfurther, “Now we can respond, ask questions, and even place orders for products or services. This\ninteractivity can involve more than the Internet; we can gain interactivity on the telephone,\nthrough text messaging on cell phones, and while playing video games.”\nMedia also offers opportunities for engagement,a media buzzword that refers to the capti-\nvating quality of media that the audience finds engrossing, such as the “wire dancers” on the Win-\ndows Vista outdoor board. Certainly this can apply to television commercials and cinema\nadvertising, but it can also be applied to print and Internet ads—anything on which readers con-\ncentrate. Media experts describe engagement as the closeness of fit between the interests of view-\ners and the relevance of the media content.4 This is how media open the door of the critical\n“perception” step in the Facets Model of Effects that we introduced in Chapter 4.\nMedia are also contact points in that they connecta brand with the audience and ultimately\ntouch their emotions, as well as engage their minds. The difference between delivery and con-\nnection is significant. To deliver means “to take something to a person or place”; to connect\nmeans “to join together.” Delivery is the first step in connecting: it opens the door to touching a\ncustomer in a meaningful way with a brand message. Beyond conventional mass media, IMC\nconnection media also include personal experiences with events, salespeople, and customer ser-\nCHAPTER 11 • MEDIA BASICS 329\nvice, as well as word-of-mouth messages from\npeople who influence us—all of which may be-\ncome imbued with emotions leading to strong\npersonal feelings about a brand.\nThe Evolution of Media Roles\nPeople in our contemporary society live in a\nworld of media-delivered news and information,\nwhich traditionally has been supported by ad-\nvertising. Over several hundred years, media\nhave evolved from print, to radio, then televi-\nsion, and now the Internet. Newspapers, maga-\nzines, and posters provided the visual dimension\nof communication; radio added an audio dimen-\nsion. Television enabled messages to be heard\nand seen with moving images. Today we have\nthe Internet, which has basically combined tele-\nvision and the computer, thus providing the\nadded dimension of interactivity. We can sum-\nmarize these changes in technology as eras:\nThe Print Era Ink and print images repro-\nduced as newspapers, magazines, and posters.\nThe Broadcast Era Visual and audio infor-\nmation in the form of radio and television\nprograms originally transmitted through air\nwaves but now also distributed by cable and\nsatellite.\nWire dancers on an oversized billboard brought the Microsoft logo\nThe Digital Era Electronic information trans-\nto life for the launch of the Vista operating system—an example\nmitted through the Internet but, like broad-\nof a highly engaging use of outdoor advertising.\ncasting, now also distributed through cable\nand satellite.\nIt’s useful to remember that this Digital Era is quite recent.
