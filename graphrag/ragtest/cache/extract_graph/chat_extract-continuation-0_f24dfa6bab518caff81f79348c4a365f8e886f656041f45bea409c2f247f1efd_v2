The critical question is whether the reach and fre-\nquency objectives were obtained.\nVerifying the audience measurement estimates is a challenge. Media planners are working\nsometimeswithmillionsofdollars,andtheycan’taffordtogetitwrong.Wediscussedhowvari-\nousmediachannelsmeasuretheiraudiences.Forprint,servicessuchastheAuditBureauofCir-\nculations (ABC), Experian Simmons (formerly known as SMRB), and Mediamark (MRI(cid:2))\nprovidedata.Likewiseforbroadcast,Arbitron,RADAR,andA.C.Nielsenprovideaudiencemon-\nitoring.Initiallymediaplannersusetheseestimatestodevelopamediaplan,andmediabuyersuse\nthemlatertoverifytheaccumulatedimpactofthemediabuyafterthecampaignhasrun.\nMedia planning oversight is usually handled in-house by the media buyer, but it can also be\ncontracted by the advertiser to independent companies who specialize in conducting media au-\ndits of the agency’s media planning and buying operations. Nissan and Procter & Gamble are ex-\namples of companies that have hired outside media-auditing firms to confirm the execution of\ntheir media plans.\nAs the job gets more complex, media planners are being asked to prove the wisdom of their\nrecommendations in an area where the data they use are sometimes suspect or unreliable, partic-\nularly if there are problems with the media measurement companies’formulas and reporting sys-\ntems. Nielsen, for example, has been subject to much criticism for its television ratings.\nAnotherissueistheimpactofvideorecordersandDVRs.Whatdoviewersseeandremem-\nberastheyskiporfastforwardthroughcommercials?Testshaveshownthatviewersdoremem-\nbersomeofthespots,oratleastthebrands.Theeasiesttorecallwereonesthathadbeenseen\nbefore.Othercharacteristicsofsuccessfuladshavethebrand’slogointhemiddleofthescreen\nandleaveitonthescreenformoresecondsthaninanormalTVcommercial.Italsohelpsifthe\nactionisn’ttoofastwithmanyscreenchanges.Simplecommercialsareeasiertoseeandremem-\nberwhenzipping.15\nTo better understand the problems in media evaluation, let’s look at two areas where media\nperformance is hard to estimate: out-of-home media and new media, including the Internet.\nOut-of-Home Media As you would expect, accurately measuring the mobile audience for out-\ndoor advertising is challenging. Traffic counts can be gathered, but the problem is that traffic does\nnot equal exposure. Just because a car drives by a board doesn’t mean that the driver and/or pas-\nsengers see it, particularly since some outdoor boards are more attention getting than others, as\nthe “road rage” board illustrates.\nNew Media Similarly, the measures of effectiveness used to evaluate offline campaigns don’t\nseem to transfer well to the online world. Is the website visitor or banner ad viewer similar to a\nmember of the print or broadcast audience? The online industry hasn’t been able to establish on-\nline equivalencies for GRPs and CPMs and is\nstill trying to define what makes an effective In-\nternet ad and to develop a system that accurately\nmeasures online effectiveness. At the heart of the\nproblem is the question of what exactly is to be\nmeasured and how that equates to other media:\nreaders, viewers, visitors, hits, click-throughs, or\nminutes spent with a site? Web-analytic firms\nare developing more sophisticated tracking pro-\ngrams to measure user activity in terms of Web\npages visited, time spent, and click-throughs.\nAlternative media, such as word of mouth,\nsocial media, and guerilla marketing campaigns,\nare even harder to measure and media planners\nThis outdoor board from the United Kingdom attracted attention\nsearch for reliable indicators of exposure num-\nbecause of its interesting visual but also because of its challenging\nidea.
