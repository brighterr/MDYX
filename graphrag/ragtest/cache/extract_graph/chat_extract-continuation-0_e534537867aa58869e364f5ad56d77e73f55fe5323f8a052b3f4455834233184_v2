Tools that help estimate the most optimum use of various media plans us-\ning computer models involve calculating the weight of a media schedule and optimizing the\nschedule for the greatest impact. These optimizationtechniques enable marketers to determine\nthe relative impact of a media mix on product sales and optimize the efficiency of the media mix.\nGenerally the models can create an unlimited number of media combinations and then sim-\nulate the sales produced by each. Chrysler’s digital agency, Organic, has designed a system to de-\ntermine the best way to allocate the marketing communication budget. Here’s how it works: “The\nsystem calculates how much ad spending is needed to meet certain sales targets and then analyzes\nhow both online and offline ads affect Web activity and, ultimately, sales.”9Using optimization\nmodels, the media planner can make intelligent decisions, given factors such as budget, timing,\nand so forth. Other optimization services are CPM Advisors (www.cpmadvisors.com), Aggregate\nKnowledge (www.aggregateknowledge.com), and Telmar (www.telmar.com).\nThe issue of media optimization, however, is bigger than just numbers and estimates of ef-\nficiency. It also involves questions of media overload and consumer irritation, as the A Matter of\nPrinciplefeature argues.\nA Sample Media Plan\nMedia plans do not have a universal form, but there is a common (and logical) pattern to the de-\ncision stages as we have outlined in this chapter. To illustrate one style of presentation in a real-\nlife setting, we use an actual media plan for a Women’s Health Services program based in\nhospitals. This media plan example was contributed by Amy Hume, who was media director\nCHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 441\nWOMEN’S HEALTH SERVICES MEDIA PLAN\nLaunched in winter 2009–10 in hospitals throughout the central United States, the Women’s Health Services Program\n(WHSP) combines the health care services that women may be exposed to throughout their lives under one roof. It\nbrings together services beyond just gynecology, like oncology, dermatology, cardiology, and more. It aids women by\nproviding one central point of contact—a concierge—to coordinate their appointments.\nCommunication Objectives\n• Establish awareness of a new Women’s Health Services Program opening in select local hospitals throughout the\nHeartland of the U.S.\n• Generate buzz and word of mouth\n• Drive requests for information via Web and phone\nStrategic Plan Development\nWhile “all women” were the target, we knew that the best opportunity started with wealthy, more educated women\nwho would act as influencers in the market. As a result, we focused, demographically, on,—Working Women Ages\n30–54 with HHI $75M+, with or without kids.\nIt was important for us to gain further insight into their behaviors and attitudes relating to health care, commu-\nnication and everyday routines. Via both syndicated research and primary research we uncovered many insights that\nhelped direct the plan:\nActivities/Behaviors\n• They work out?—either at home, in a club, or outdoors.\n• They exercise to manage their weight, be more relaxed, reduce health problems.\n• While most women are not passionate about working out, many say it is an essential part of their lives.\n• They travel to/from work an average of 7.5 miles—either in car or public transportation (depending on the market).\n• They go to a coffee shop usually 1x/day—both independents and chains.\n• They use the Internet for e-mail, social networking and to research just about anything.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF DENVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Denver is an educational institution that offers various programs, including business studies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILSON SPORTING GOODS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wilson Sporting Goods is a company that sponsors tennis camps by providing practice balls and racquets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIVO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TiVo is a company known for its digital video recorders that allow viewers to time-shift programs and skip commercials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRYSLER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chrysler is an automotive company that uses digital agencies to optimize its marketing communication budget)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORGANIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organic is a digital agency that works with Chrysler to determine the best allocation of marketing budgets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CPM ADVISORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CPM Advisors is a service that provides media optimization solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGGREGATE KNOWLEDGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Aggregate Knowledge is a company offering media optimization services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TELMAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Telmar is a company that provides media optimization services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES PROGRAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Women's Health Services Program is a healthcare initiative launched in hospitals across the central United States, offering comprehensive services for women)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY HUME<|>PERSON<|>Amy Hume is a media director who contributed to the media plan for the Women's Health Services Program)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILSON SPORTING GOODS<|>TENNIS CAMPS<|>Wilson Sporting Goods sponsors tennis camps by providing equipment<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRYSLER<|>ORGANIC<|>Organic is a digital agency that collaborates with Chrysler to optimize marketing budgets<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES PROGRAM<|>AMY HUME<|>Amy Hume contributed to the media plan for the Women's Health Services Program<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
