Even though it’s a boot\nad, it projects an elegance that reflects an appreciation for\nnature and a serene outdoor scene (footprints in the snow). The\nACG “Air Krakatoa” ad with an asymmetrical layout uses spot\ncolor effectively in the copy. Note how the layout “shouts,” in\ncontrast to the soft tone of the Dunham boot ad.\nredcan.ThemarketerdefendeditselfsayingthenewcanwasmoreappealingtoChineseconsumers\nandmirrorsthecolorofthecountry’sflag.Criticswonderiftheduelingcanswilljustcausecon-\nfusionamongChineseconsumerswhoareslowlybuildingloyaltytotheseWesternbrands.4\nThe use of black and white is also an important choice in image design because it lends a dig-\nnity and sophistication to the visual, even if it’s a boot as the Dunham ad demonstrates. Ahistori-\ncal effect can be created by shooting in black and white or by using a sepia tone, which can make\nthe images look like old prints that have been weathered by time. When realism is important to\nconvey in an ad, full-color photographs may be essential. Some products and ad illustrations just\ndon’t look right in black and white—pizza, flower gardens, and nail polish, for instance.\nIn print, designers also use spot color,in which a second color in addition to black (a black-\nand-white photo or illustration with an accent color) is used to highlight important elements. The\nuse of spot color is highly attention getting, particularly in newspaper ads. The ACG ad uses red\nspot color to accent the product and key words.\nColor also can help an ad convey a mood. Warm colors, such as red, yellow, and orange, con-\nvey happiness. Pastels are soft and often bring a friendly tone to a print ad. Earth tones are natu-\nral and no-nonsense. Cool colors, such as blue and green, are aloof, calm, serene, reflective, and\nintellectual. Yellow and red have the most attention-getting power. Red may symbolize alarm and\ndanger as well as warmth. Black communicates high drama and can express power and elegance.\nNote that these color associations are culturally determined and uses like these are common in\nWestern countries, but may not be effective in other cultures. White, for example, is the color of\ndeath in many Asian countries.\nPrinciple Typography Not only do art directors carefully choose colors, they also specify the ad’s\nType has a functional role typography—theappearanceofthead’sprintedmatter.Inmostcases,goodtypesettingdoesnot\nin the way it presents the callattentiontoitselfbecauseitsprimaryroleisfunctional—toconveythewordsofthemessage.\nletters in words so they Typeorlettering,however,alsohasanaestheticrole,andthetypeselectioncan,inasubtleornot\ncan be easily read, but it sosubtleway,contributetotheimpactandmoodofthemessage,astheACGbootaddemonstrated.\nalso has an aesthetic role\nAddesignerschoosefromamongthousandsoftypefacestofindtherightoneforthead’smes-\nand can contribute to the\nsage.
