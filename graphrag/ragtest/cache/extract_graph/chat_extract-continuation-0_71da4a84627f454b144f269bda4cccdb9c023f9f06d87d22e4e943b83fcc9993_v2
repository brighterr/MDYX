Here is a radio script from that PSA campaign.\nA graduate of the University of North Texas, Trent Walters was nominated by\nProfessor Sheri Broyles.\n142 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nAge is driving a fundamental shift in U.S. marketing strategy. For 50 years, marketers have\nfocused on reaching young people, not only because they are in the formative years of making\nbrand choices, but also because the youth market during that era was huge in terms of numbers.\nNow with the boomer bulge moving into retirement, there is tension between the temptation to\nfocus on young people and the realization that wealth and numbers belong to this active senior\nmarket. Not only is the senior marketing getting larger, a Pew Research Center study finds a\ngrowing generation gap between old and young. Almost 80 percent believe the viewpoints are\ndramatically different and this shows up in attitudes toward religion, values, morality, lifestyles,\nmanners, and work ethic.15\nGender and Sexual Orientation An obvious basis for differences in marketing and advertising\nis gender. The fact that interests marketers is that women account for 85 percent of all consumer\npurchases in the United States.16So it’s important to know what attracts a female market and how\nyou build brand relationships with them. The Boston Consulting Group spotted the first stages of\nthe United States evolving to a matriarchal society in the mid-2000s.17Their research, and more\nrecent studies, point to the increasing percentage of women in college,18which also may mean\neventual changes in income and occupation patterns.\nMany brands are either masculine or feminine in terms of use, as well as brand personality.\nIt is unlikely that men would use a brand of cologne called “White Shoulders.” The Gillette Com-\npany found that the majority of women would not purchase regular Gillette razor blades, so they\nintroduced brands exclusively for women, such as the Daisy disposable razors. An interesting\nstory is that Marlboro started off as a cigarette marketed to women and was later targeted to men\nwith the cowboy image.\nGender stereotypes have been a problem in advertising for decades and some believe that\nmay be because the majority of the work has been created by men. Jessica Shank, a copywriter at\nGoodby, Silverstein & Partners, explored that idea and concluded, “If most of the work specifi-\ncally aimed at women were any indication of modern life, we’d all be at home dancing with our\nmops and fretting about plastic food storage.” She explains, “There’s a real disconnect between\nthe lives women lead and the way advertising portrays our daily lives and desires.”19\nDuring the past decade sexual orientation has also become a marketing issue as gay and\nlesbian consumers have become serious target markets. Bob Witeck, CEO of Washington,\nD.C.–based Witeck-Combs Communications, estimates that the buying power of this market is\nconservatively estimated at $712 billion. He’s basing that on a population estimate of approxi-\nmately 15 million, which would be 6.7 percent of the population.20In the A Matter of Practice\nfeature at www.pearsonhighered.com/moriarty,Witeck explains how this market dealt with the\neconomic downturn.\nEducation, Occupation, and Income According to the 2009 Census Report, U.S. males are\nfalling behind females in higher levels of education. Generally, white U.S. consumers attain\nhigher levels of education than blacks and Hispanics. For advertisers, education also tends to cor-\nrelate with the type of medium consumers prefer. Consumers with lower education are higher\nusers of television, especially cable. Consumers with higher education prefer print media, the In-\nternet, and selected radio and cable stations. Likewise, education dictates the way copy is written\nand its level of difficulty. Examine ads in FortuneorForbesand you will find different words, art,\nand products than you will in Peopleortabloidpublications. Advertisers don’t make value judg-\nments about these statistics. Their objective is to match advertising messages to the characteris-\ntics of the target audience.\nMost people identify themselves by what they do. In the United States there has been a grad-\nual trend from blue-collar occupations (manufacturing, for example) to white-collar occupations\n(management and information). There have also been shifts within white-collar work from\nsalesto other areas, such as professional, technical, and administrative positions. The number of\nservice-related jobs continues to increase, especially in the health care, education, and legal and\nbusiness service sectors. Much of this transition is a direct result\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The US Department of Transportation is a federal agency responsible for transportation safety and infrastructure in the United States)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AD COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Ad Council is a nonprofit organization that produces public service announcements in partnership with various agencies and organizations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRENT WALTERS<|>PERSON<|>Trent Walters is an account director for the Richards Group and a graduate of the University of North Texas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICHARDS GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Richards Group is an advertising agency involved in the LATCH campaign)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of North Texas is an educational institution where Trent Walters graduated from)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHERI BROYLES<|>PERSON<|>Sheri Broyles is a professor who nominated Trent Walters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEW RESEARCH CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that conducts public opinion polling and demographic research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Boston Consulting Group is a global management consulting firm that identified trends in the U.S. evolving to a matriarchal society)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GILLETTE COMPANY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Gillette Company is a brand known for its razors and personal care products)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOODBY, SILVERSTEIN & PARTNERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An advertising agency where Jessica Shank works as a copywriter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA SHANK<|>PERSON<|>Jessica Shank is a copywriter at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners who explored gender stereotypes in advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WITECK-COMBS COMMUNICATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A communications firm based in Washington, D.C., focusing on the gay and lesbian market)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOB WITECK<|>PERSON<|>Bob Witeck is the CEO of Witeck-Combs Communications, specializing in the gay and lesbian market)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION<|>AD COUNCIL<|>The US Department of Transportation partnered with the Ad Council for the LATCH campaign<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRENT WALTERS<|>RICHARDS GROUP<|>Trent Walters is an account director at the Richards Group<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRENT WALTERS<|>UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS<|>Trent Walters graduated from the University of North Texas<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRENT WALTERS<|>SHERI BROYLES<|>Sheri Broyles nominated Trent Walters<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEW RESEARCH CENTER<|>BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP<|>Both organizations conduct research on societal trends<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GILLETTE COMPANY<|>GOODBY, SILVERSTEIN & PARTNERS<|>Both companies are involved in advertising and marketing<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA SHANK<|>GOODBY, SILVERSTEIN & PARTNERS<|>Jessica Shank works as a copywriter at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOB WITECK<|>WITECK-COMBS COMMUNICATIONS<|>Bob Witeck is the CEO of Witeck-Combs Communications<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
