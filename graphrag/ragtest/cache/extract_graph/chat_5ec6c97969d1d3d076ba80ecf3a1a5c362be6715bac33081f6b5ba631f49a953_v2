At the 2010 World Cup, 36 Dutch women\nwere kicked out of their country’s soccer game\nagainst Denmark. Why? They were accused of\nwearing orange mini-dresses to promote an unli-\ncensed beer by Dutch brewery Bavaria at the\nWorld Cup event. American firm Anheuser-\nBusch, maker of Budweiser beer, was one of the\nofficial sponsors of the World Cup; Bavaria was\nnot. FIFA, organizer of the event, said ambush\nmarketing was not permitted. This was not the\nfirst time Bavaria was accused of being involved\nin Ambush marketing. In a 2006 World Cup\nmatch, Dutch fans were forced to take off the or-\nange lederhosen given to them by Bavaria. The\nidea of fans removing their pants in itself was\npotentially amusing, and the ambush tactic de-\ntracted from the official sponsor Anheuser-\nBusch.\nOther Promotional Support Advertisers use\nblimps, balloons, and inflatables—even skywrit- To help promote the opening of the movie Spider-Man, inflatables like\ning planes—to capture attention and create an this one were placed along buildings in major cities throughout the\naura of excitement at events.

Agiant inflatable, such as\nSpider-Man on a building, demands attention and provides an entertaining and highly memorable\nproduct presentation. Its effectiveness comes from its huge size and three-dimensional shape.\nLoyalty Programs\nAnother type of program that crosses the line between advertising and promotion is frequency, or\nloyalty, programs. Aloyalty program,also called a continuityorfrequencyprogram (such as\nairline frequent flyer programs), is a promotion to increase customer retention.
