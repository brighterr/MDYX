(Check the company out at www.hall-and-partners.com.) In case you’re\ninterested in account planning as a career, here is an actual job description for a vice president for\nglobal consumer insights for a major apparel company:\nThe role of the VP, Global Consumer Insights, is to create competitive advantage by deliv-\nering fact-based consumer/customer understanding and insights that facilitate speed and ac-\ncuracy of strategic and tactical decision-making across all critical parts of the organization.\nIn short, turning data into Insights, and then into Action. The planner will accomplish this\nCHAPTER 7 • STRATEGIC PLANNING 211\nby placing consumers first, integrating their “voices” into the planning process, and creat-\ning sustaining value at the corporate and brand levels.\nAs the job description suggests, the account planning function develops the marketing com-\nmunication strategy with other members of the client and agency team and guides its implemen-\ntation in the creative work and media planning. Here’s an example from Dunkin’Donuts of how\naccount planning works to uncover, in this case, the barriers to purchasing fancy coffee drinks.\nThis mini-case was provided by Regina Lewis, a member of this book’s Advisory Board and for-\nmer vice president of consumer and brand insights at Dunkin’:22\nWe found through our research that people wanted to try espresso drinks like lattes and cap-\npuccinos, but they were intimidated and thought such fancy coffee drinks were an ordeal to\norder. Dunkin’Donuts, of course, is known for its coffee and we felt that to be a great cof-\nfee player, we had to have an espresso line. But our brand has always been hot regular cof-\nfee for average Joe. What we realized was that there was a place in the marketplace for\nespresso-based drinks for everybody. It doesn’t have to be a fancy treat. We learned that a\nlot of people like the milky steamed beverages, but they were intimidated by whether they\nwould know how to order them.\nWhen we launched our new line, we used the positioning umbrella of the democ-\nratization of espresso. We dramatically changed the way our customers view a latte and\neliminated the whole barista thing. With push-button machines, we created a world where\nyou can get espresso through the drive-through in less than two minutes. We made espresso\navailable for everybody and we also priced our drinks under Starbucks. We launched with\na big public relations campaign titled “The Espresso Revolution—a Shot Being Fired in\nNew England.”\nIn contrast to account managers who are seen as the voice of the client, account planners are Principle\ndescribed as the voice of the consumer. As London’s Account Planning Group (APG) explains it, The account manager is\n“The job is to ensure that an understanding of consumer attitudes and behavior is brought to bear seen as the voice of the\nat every stage of communications development via continuous involvement in the process.”23 client, and the account\nAccountplannersdon’tdesignthecreativestrategyforanad,becausethisisusuallyateam planner is seen as the\nvoice of the consumer.\nprocesswiththeparticipationofthecreativepeople.Rather,theplannerevaluatesconsumers’\nrelationships with the brand to determine the kind of message to which they might respond.\nUltimately,theobjectiveistohelpthecreativeteamcomeupwithabetteridea—makingtheir\ncreativeprocesseasierandfaster.SusanMendelsohn,aleaderintheU.S.accountplanningin-\ndustryandanothermemberofthisbook’sAdvisoryBoard,explainstheaccountplanner’stask\nasthefollowing24:\n1. Understand the meaning of the brand.\n2. Understand the target audience’s relationship to the brand.\n3. Articulate communication strategies.\n4. Prepare creative briefs based on an understanding of the consumer and brand.\n5. Evaluate the effectiveness of the communication in terms of how the target reacts to it (so\nthat planners can keep learning more about consumers and brand communication).\nThe Research Foundation\nAs we said at the beginning of this chapter, understanding begins with consumer research, which\nis at the core of account planning. Some advertisers, such as Johnson & Johnson, insist that con-\nsumer researchers and creative teams need to work closely together.25That is the role, if not the\ngoal, of most account planners.\nPlanners use a wide variety of research tools to do “insight mining.” In a sense they are so-\ncial anthropologists who are in touch with cultural and social trends and understand how they take\non relevance in people’s lives. To do that, the account planner is an integrator(who brings all of\nthe information together) and a synthesizer (who expresses what it all means in one startlingly\nsimple statement).
