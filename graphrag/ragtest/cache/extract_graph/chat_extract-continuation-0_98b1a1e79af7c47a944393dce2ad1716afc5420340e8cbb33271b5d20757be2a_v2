The objective is to\nget participants talking in a conversational format so researchers can observe the dialogue and in-\nteractions among the group. It’s a directed group interview.

Other qualitative tools can also be\nused with groups such as asking participants to create posters, diaries, or poems or complete exer-\ncises in day mapping or memory associations (what comes to mind when you think of something,\nsuch as a brand, situation, or location).\nFocus groups can be used at any step in the planning process, but they are often used early\nin information gathering to probe for patterns of thought and behavior that are then tested using\nquantitative research tools, such as surveys. For example, the Cheetos team conducted focus\ngroups with adult heavy-users of Cheetos. Information from focus groups can uncover, as it did\nin this case, answers to “how” and “why” questions. The Cheetos participants said they gave\nthemselves permission to lick their fingers and not act like adults.

This approach is designed to break down barriers\nand save time in getting to more in-depth responses. For example, one study of sensitive and in-\nsensitive visuals used in advertising directed to black women found that a self-constructed friend-\nship group was easier to assemble and yielded more honest and candid responses than a more\ntraditional focus group where respondents are recruited by a research company.12\nTheWebisnotonlyatoolforonlinesurveys,butalsoforonlinefocusgroupsbasedonthe\nideaofgettingagroupofbrandloyaliststogetherasapassword-protectedonlinecommunity.On-\nlineresearchcompanyCommunispacehascreatedsome225onlinecommunitiesformarketers,in-\ncludingKraftFoods,UnileverforitsAxebrand,andCharlesSchwab.Youcanreadmoreaboutthis\ntechniqueatwww.communispace.com.IntheA MatterofPractice:Part2feature,KarlWeisscon-\ntinueshisdiscussionofthevariouswaystheInternetcanbeusedtoconductqualitativeresearch.\nAbroad-based approach to online focus groups is available through the new practice called\ncrowdsourcing, a term coined by Jeff Howe in Wiredmagazine in 2006.13It refers to aggregat-\ning the wisdom of Internet users in a type of digital brainstorming.
