reduce health problems.\n• While most women are not passionate about working out, many say it is an essential part of their lives.\n• They travel to/from work an average of 7.5 miles—either in car or public transportation (depending on the market).\n• They go to a coffee shop usually 1x/day—both independents and chains.\n• They use the Internet for e-mail, social networking and to research just about anything.\n• But particularly health-related issues—2/3 of online health site users are female.\n• Women make 75% of health care decisions, spend 2/3 of health care $, and account for 2/3 of hospital procedures.\nAttitudes\n• Women’s most influential source of information or advice is their circle of friends:\n• Women rely on advice and opinions of those individuals around them who have proven themselves in the past.\n• They respond to anecdotes/storytelling—they will connect to an engaging narrative relating the lives and experi-\nences of other women.\n• Through our primary research we found that many women have phone conversations with female relatives\nonce/day.\n• Conversation serves many purposes in women’s lives: recharging, validation, and learning.\n• Women focus on the emotional—happiness, peace of mind, fulfillment, self-confidence—vs. more traditional,\nmaterial, outward manifestations of success.\n• When choosing health care they are looking for:\n• “Someone who knows me,” “Ability to help with issues,” “Treat me as an individual.”\n• It’s important for women to be communicated to on a personal level.\n• They believe it’s stressful and hard to find a physician who’s interested in their overall health.\n(continued)\nA graduate\nof the\nat the Denver-based Barnhart Communications when she prepared this plan.

The primary communication objective for this Women’s Health Services\nProfessor Tom Duncan.\ncampaign was to build awareness. The media-related objectives that would deliver this\nawareness involved two tasks: generating buzz among the target audience and creating\n442 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nWith this background and research, we were able to establish our key strategies.\nStrategies\n• Overall, we determined that we would be most effective by using a combination of traditional and non-traditional\nvehicles that intersect women in relevant, yet respectful places—and in non-traditional ways.\n• We knew that it was important to seek contacts that increase relevance—that tie into her perception of healthy\nliving—nutrition, fitness, and relaxation—and into her passions—family and hobbies.\n• Also, we needed to recommend contacts that would help provide impact, and thus increased receptivity of the mes-\nsage. Those that would signal “for me” (personal, part of my world), be trustworthy, and provide opportunity for\nnarrative/storytelling.\n• Finally, it was important to get out of the traditional health care mold and get her to react and engage.\nWho (Target)\nActive Female Health Managers\n• Working women, married, ages 30–54, with or without kids\n• More likely to ask their doctor to send them to a preferred specialist or hospital\n• Indirectly, their knowledge, experience, and passion for updated health information makes them a valuable re-\nsource?—they have a large sphere of influence.\nWhere (Geography)\nWhile the program itself was launching in 10 cities, we decided to focus on the more efficiently priced, mid-sized metro\nareas in the Central U.S. —Minneapolis, Denver, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Kansas City.\nWhen (Timing/Seasonality)\nLaunch September 2009 to lead up to multi-city opening. Also coincides with time of “renewal” with the back-to-\nschool mentality.\nProvide additional support in January as people are making resolutions—mostly in the area of health.\nFollow up with an effort in May tied into Women’s Health month.\nHow Much (Weight Levels/Budget)\nWe analyzed competitive advertising pressure of other hospitals and health centers in these markets as well as promi-\nnent women’s programs like Brigham & Women’s, Oregon Health & Science University Center for Women’s Health, and\nthe Iris Cantor Women’s Health Center. We determined that there was little consistent mass media pressure in any mar-\nket by these entities.\nenough interest that the campaign would cause the target to search for information using the\nwebsite and phone number provided in the campaign materials.\n• Strategic Plan Development:Consumer InsightsThe key to this media plan is under-\nstanding the consumer market for the Women’s Health Services Program (WHSP).\nBackground research from the campaign’s situation analysis is used to describe the\nwomen in this market in terms of their activities and behaviors, as well as their attitudes\nand feelings.\nCHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 443\nDue to the absence of substantive competitive reach and frequency benchmarks by competition or like programs,\nbased weight level objectives on history and experience:\n• During launch, generate 85% reach/4.0 frequency per month\n• For follow-up months, 65%/3.0 as budget allows\nWe were working with a Year One budget of $3.0MM to cover all markets.\nWhat (Vehicle Selection)\nMagazines: Be where they’re searching for health care information—62% of women ranked magazines as their #1\nsource of information for healthy eating habits, fitness, health, and overall well-being.
