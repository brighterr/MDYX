Employees, for example, may also\nbe customers, shareholders, and members of the local community, perhaps even elected officials.\nTheir primary medium is word of mouth, which is another reason why this type of communica-\ntion is so important in IMC programs. The fact of overlapping membership complicates message\nstrategy and demands that there be a certain core level of consistency in all brand messages both\nfrom a company but also within stakeholder conversations.\nContact Points IMC programs are designed to maximize all the contacts that a consumer and\nother stakeholders might have with a brand. As we explained in Chapter 2, contact points,also\ncalled touch points, are all the ways and places where a person can come into contact with a\nbrand, all the points where a message is delivered about the brand. Contact points can be adver-\ntising and traditional marketing communication messages, but they can also include all of the\nSeventh Principle other ways a brand communicates through personal experiences. This leads to the Seventh Prin-\nof IMC ciple of IMC:all contact points deliver brand messages.These messages can be both good and\nAll contact points deliver bad, creating positive or negative feelings. Marcom managers hope to maximize and leverage the\nbrand messages. good ones and minimize the bad ones.\nSynergy and Strategic Consistency\nGiven that an IMC plan involves a lot of messages delivered through multiple media at many dif-\nferent contact points, as well as interactive communication, the marcom planner’s biggest con-\ncern is creating consistent messages. The ultimate difference between an advertising campaign\nand an IMC campaign is the creation, development, delivery, and evaluation of multiplatform\nmessages. For that reason, IMC planners are looking for ways to intensify the synergy of the mes-\nsages so that the brand impact is greater than what can be delivered by any one type of message.\nEighth Principle This leads to the Eighth Principle of IMC:consistency drives synergy.\nof IMC Synergy is particularly important for marketers concerned about the efficiency of their mar-\nConsistency drives keting communication who are looking for ways to maximize the cost efficiency of their budgets.\nsynergy. Andy Polansky, president of the Weber Shandwick agency, cautions managers to be efficient by\nmaking all communication efforts align with audience interests “so there is strategic consistency\nacross how you are marketing online, in-person and in traditional media.”29\nThe problem is that we know various stakeholders have different types of bonds with a\nbrand, so the message, by necessity, will be different for different audiences. Kellogg’s doesn’t\ntalk to moms the same way it talks to kids about a kid’s cereal, such as Froot Loops. And it cer-\ntainly has a different message for regulators at the Food and Drug Administration and activists\nconcerned about children’s health, as well as those messages for the investment community in-\ncluding its own shareholders. It isn’t that the messages are inconsistent, they are just different in\nthat they address different concerns and issues of the various stakeholder audiences. What is\ncommon, however, is faithfulness to the brand image and position. That’s what we mean by\nstrategic consistency—messages vary with the interest of the stakeholder but the brand strat-\negy remains the same.\nSynergy is an organizational problem, one that calls for cross-functional planning.In other\nwords, everyone involved in delivering messages or responding to consumer messages needs to\nbe involved in planning the campaign so no off-strategy messages undercut the consistency of the\neffort.\nLooking Ahead\nStrategic consistency is the result of carefully researched marketing communication plans.\nThe actual messages that bring the strategy to life are also a result of strategic planning, but\nalso creative thinking. Part 3 of this book will review the creative side of marketing commu-\nnication beginning with Chapter 8, which continues the strategy discussion in terms of mes-\nsage strategy.\nCHAPTER 7 • STRATEGIC PLANNING 219\nIT’S A WRAP\nWinning the Coke Zero\nInfringement Case\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SUSAN MENDELSOHN<|>PERSON<|>Susan Mendelsohn is involved in brand marketing and describes targets for her snack clients, including brand marketing consumers, café and kiosk customers, food service operations, and sales staff)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEBER SHANDWICK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Weber Shandwick is an agency whose president, Andy Polansky, emphasizes strategic consistency in marketing communication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDY POLANSKY<|>PERSON<|>Andy Polansky is the president of Weber Shandwick agency, advocating for strategic consistency across marketing efforts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KELLOGG'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kellogg's is a company that tailors its messages to different audiences, such as moms, kids, regulators, and the investment community, while maintaining brand consistency)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSAN MENDELSOHN<|>WEBER SHANDWICK<|>Susan Mendelsohn's work in brand marketing aligns with the strategic consistency advocated by Weber Shandwick<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDY POLANSKY<|>WEBER SHANDWICK<|>Andy Polansky is the president of Weber Shandwick, promoting strategic consistency in marketing<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KELLOGG'S<|>WEBER SHANDWICK<|>Kellogg's approach to strategic consistency in messaging aligns with the principles advocated by Weber Shandwick<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
