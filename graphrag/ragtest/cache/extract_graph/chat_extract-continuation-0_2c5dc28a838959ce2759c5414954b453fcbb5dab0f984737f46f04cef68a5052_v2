Before Wii was even launched, it was featured in South Park, showed up on\nthe front page of The Wall Street Journal, and other popular media including\nPeople magazine, NPR, and BusinessWeek.\nOther efforts to spread the word included a MySpace page, which attracted a\nmillion page views, brand partnerships with 7-Eleven, Pringles Snack Stacks, and\nComedy Central. Wii also showed up on the Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, and\nDiscovery Kids Network.\nGiven the need to teach people how to play the game on their home TV\nscreens, an important venue was in-person demonstrations either in stores or at\nevents, such as trade shows and video game expositions. The opening photo of\nthis chapter shows the president of Nintendo and the general manager of the en-\ntertainment division playing a game of tennis on a large video screen during the\nElectronic Entertainment Expo in Hollywood.\nHow well did the marketing communication strategy work in launching this\nnew brand?

The Nin-\ntendo story demonstrates how marketing communication can help accomplish marketing objec-\ntives. It illustrates some fundamentals that will help you think through challenges you’re likely to\nface in your career. This chapter starts with an explanation of the basic principles of marketing. We\nthen explore the important concept of branding and why it is so heavily dependent on marketing\ncommunication. Finally we explain the concept of integrated marketing communication.\nWHAT IS MARKETING?\nAcompany like Nintendo needs effective marketing communication in order for its products to\nsucceed in the marketplace. However, to succeed, a product must also offer customers value, and\nmuch of a product’s value is created by marketing decisions that determine the product’s design\nand ease of use, distribution, and pricing, as well as its marketing communication.\nMarketing is designed to build brand and customer relationships that generate sales and prof-\nits or, in the case of nonprofits, memberships, volunteers, and donations. In turbulent times like\nthe marketing communication industry has been through with the Great Recession, it is useful to\nremember the point we made in the Part I opener—that most of the basic marketing practices and\nprinciples are not only still viable, but may provide the only way through the chaos. So let’s start\nby defining basic marketing concepts and see how they relate to marketing communication.\nWhy Marketing 101?\nSome of you reading this textbook are marketing majors but others have not had and may never\ntake a marketing course. For that reason, we will present here a quick crash course in those as-\npects of marketing that are most relevant to marketing communication.\nAprocess and a discipline, marketing is the way a product is designed, tested, produced,\nbranded, packaged, priced, distributed, and promoted. The American Marketing Association\nCHAPTER 2 • INTEGRATED BRAND COMMUNICATION 35\n(AMA) updated its definition of the term in 2007 as “Mar-\nketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for cre-\nating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings\nthat have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at\nlarge.”1It is a function within an organization that focuses on\nmanaging customer relationships to benefit all of a brand’s\nstakeholders—by stakeholders we mean all the individuals\nand groups who have a stake in the success of the brand. Pos-\nitive relationships create value for a brand.\nTraditionally, the objective of most marketing programs has\nbeen to sell products, which we define as goods,services,orideas.\nThis is accomplished by matching a product’s availability—\nand the company’s production capabilities—to the consumer’s\nneed, desire, or demand for the product. As you may re-\nmember from Wende Zomnir’s The Inside Story in Chap-\nter 1, her role as a founder and creative director for Urban\nDecay Cosmetics is to lead the market with edgy product de-\nsigns and formulations that appeal to fashion-conscious\nyoung women.\nGoods and services are identified in terms of their\nproduct category.By category, we mean the classification\nto which the product is assigned. For example, Harley-\nDavidson is in the motorcycle category, Apple Macintosh is SHOWCASE\nin the computer category, and Burger King is in the fast- The Urban Decay product line of cosmetics projects a street-\nfood category.
