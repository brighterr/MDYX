Larry\nKelley and Donald Jugenheimer explain in their account planning textbook that it is impor-\ntant to measure the way these personality traits are associated with a brand or a competi-\ntor’s brand. They observe, “Sometimes it is as important to understand what your brand\nisn’t as much as what it is.”13The point is to profile the brand as if it were a person, some-\none you like.\n• Brand Position and UnderstandingWhat does it stand for? Brand strategists sometimes\nfocus on the souloressenceof the brand. This is related to position, but it goes deeper into\nthe question of what makes the brand distinctive. As Jack Trout explained, “You have to\nstand for something,” and it has to be something that matters to consumers.14Kodak is a\nclassic example of a brand with a soul, one deeply embedded in personal pictures and mem-\nories. Hallmark’s soul is found in the expression of sentiment. Brand essence is also appar-\nent when a brand dominates or defines its category. Category leadership often comes from\nbeingthe first brand in the market—and with that comes an ownership position. ESPN, for\nexample, owns sports information, Silk is thesoy milk drink, Starbucks created the high-end\ncoffeehouse, and eBay owns the world of online auctions.\n• Brand ImageUnderstanding brand meaning involves understanding the symbolism and as-\nsociations that create brand image,the mental impression consumers construct for a prod-\nuct. The richness of the brand image determines the quality of the relationship and the\nstrength of the associations and emotional connections that link a customer to a brand. Ad-\nvertising researchers call this brand linkage.\n• Brand Promise and Brand PreferenceAbrand is sometimes defined as a promise because\nit establishes an expectation based on familiarity, consistency, and predictability. And believ-\ning the brand promise leads to brand preference and intention to buy. That’s what has driven\nMcDonald’s to its position as a worldwide leader in the fast-food category. You know what\nto expect when you walk into a McDonald’s anywhere in the world—quality fast food at a\nreasonable price.\n• Brand LoyaltyApersonal experience with a brand can develop into a brand relationship,\nwhich is a connection over time that results in customers preferring the brand—thus brand\nloyalty—and buying it over and over. People have unique relationships with the brands they\nPrinciple\nbuy and use regularly, and this is what makes them brand loyal.

As we have said, emotion is a powerful tool in mar-\nketing communication and brand liking leads to trust and\nloyalty. Branding expert John Williams explains, “Research\nshows that reason and emotions differ in that reason gener-\nates conclusions but not necessarily actions, while emotions\nmore frequently lead to actions.”16Brand liking is the most\npowerful differentiator.\nThe challenge to advertisers is to manage their commu-\nnication efforts so the fragments fit together to form a coher-\nent and integrated brand impression. An example of creating\na brand meaning that connects with its audience is the classic\nWall Street Journalcampaign that ran for 25 years in adver-\ntising trade publications and established the Journalas a pre-\nmier medium for advertising. You can find many of the ads\nfrom this campaign at www.aef.com/industry/careers/2026.\nCampaign Strategies and Management\nOnce the situation has been analyzed and the objectives\nstated, planners decide how to achieve the objectives. That\ncalls for a general statement of strategy. The general strategy\nthat guides a campaign can be described in several ways. For\nexample a strategy can focus on branding, positioning, coun-\ntering the competition, or creating category dominance.\nMaybe the strategy is designed to change consumers’per-\nception of the brand’s price or price–value relationship. The\nstrategy may also seek to increase the size of the market or\nCLASSIC\nwhat marketers call share of wallet, the amount customers\nThis ad that features Carl Ally is one in a campaign series\nspend on the brand.
