Consumers must also per-\nceive King Corn as offering some clear benefit compared to the competition. Sales promotion\ndoes this by arranging for experiences, such as special events where people can try the product or\nsee it demonstrated. Trial is one of the most important objectives of promotion, but it is essential\nto get the right people, the targeted audience, involved with the product. Sales promotion has\nother tools that lead to trial, such as sampling. An effective way to get people to try King Corn is\nto give away free samples at events, in stores, or through direct mail to the home. Sampling is an\neffective strategy for introducing a new or modified product or for dislodging an entrenched mar-\nket leader by enticing potential users to try the product. As a general rule of thumb, retailers and\nmanufacturers maintain that sampling can boost sales volume as much as 10 times when used\nwith a product demonstration and 10 to 15 percent thereafter. Sampling is generally most effec-\ntive when reinforced on the spot with product coupons. Most consumers like sampling because\nthey do not lose money if they do not like the product. To be successful, the product sampled must\nvirtually sell itself with a simple trial experience.\nAnotherwaysalespromotioncanmotivatepeopletotryanewproductlikeKingCornisto\noffer a price deal—you try this product and we will give it to you cheaper than the usual price.\nThesepricedealsareusuallyofferedthroughcoupons,refunds,rebates,orpremiums.Refundsand\n526 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nTHE INSIDE STORY\nThe Intersection of the Movie\nand Promotion Industries\nHeather Schulz, University of Texas at Austin\nToday,movies“openwide”across\nOne strategy of the Avatarmarketing plan was to\nthousands of theaters on the\ncross-promote the movie on Coke Zero 12-packs and on\nsame day, and by Monday of\nMcDonald’s Happy Meals and Big Macs.
