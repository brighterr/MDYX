The Word Weatherproof, an\nof Mouth Marketing Association says no. Its ethics code19 explicitly prohibits consumers from apparel company\ntaking cash from manufacturers, suppliers, or their representatives for making recommendations, stirred up controversy\nreviews, or endorsements, unless full disclosure is provided. Do you think it was ethical that Ford with its Time Square\nloaned 100 bloggers its new Fiesta20to drive and presumably chat about on the Internet? Under billboard showing\nPresident Obama\nwhat conditions? We’ll probably see lots more examples of blogola,also referred to as flogging\nwearing what looked to\n(sponsored conversations), in the future.21\nbe one of its jackets.\nFederal regulations require that endorsers must be qualified by experience or training to\nDo you think this was a\nmake judgments, and they must actually use the product. If endorsers are comparing competing\nmisleading use of a\nbrands, they must have tried those brands as well. Those who endorse a product improperly may\npublic image?\nbe liable if the government determines there is deception.\nProduct demonstrations in television advertising also must not mislead consumers. This\nmandate is especially difficult for advertisements of food products because such factors as hot\nstudio lights and the length of time needed to shoot the commercial can make the product look\nunappetizing. Think about the problems of shooting ice cream under hot lights. Because milk\nlooks gray on television, advertisers often substitute a mixture of glue and water. The question is\nwhether the demonstration falsely upgrades the consumers’perception of the advertised brand.\nThe FTC evaluates this kind of deception on a case-by-case basis.\nOne technique some advertisers use to sidestep restrictions on demonstrations is to insert\ndisclaimers or “supers,” verbal or written words in the ad that indicate exceptions to the adver-\ntising claim made. You’ve probably seen car commercials that start with beauty shots of the prod-\nuct. Suddenly, the message is less clear; for several seconds five different, often lengthy,\ndisclaimers flash on the screen in tiny, eye-straining type, including “See dealers for details and\nguaranteed claim form” and “Deductibles and restrictions apply.”\nProduct-Related Issues Marketers need to consider carefully what they choose to produce and\nadvertise. Some key areas of concern include controversial products, unhealthy or dangerous\nproducts such as alcohol and tobacco, and prescription drugs. The decision to produce the prod-\nuct lies with the marketing department and the company’s business objectives, but advertising is\nfrequently in the spotlight because of its visibility.\nBefore an agency can create an ad for a client, it must consider the nature of the client com-\npany and its mission, marketing objectives, reputation, available resources, competition, and,\nmost importantly, product line. Can the agency and its staff honestly promote the products being\nadvertised? What would you do if you were a copywriter for an agency that has a political client\nyou don’t support? Several agencies have resigned from profitable tobacco advertising accounts\nbecause of the medical evidence about the harm cigarettes cause. In cases where the agency works\non a controversial account, there are still ethical ways to approach the business.\nControversial Products Marketing communication reflects the marketing and business ethics of\nits clients and, because of its visibility, sometimes gets the blame for selling controversial, unsafe,\n74 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nor dangerous products. For example, products that were once considered not suitable to advertise,\nPrinciple\nsuch as firearms, gambling, hemorrhoid preparations, feminine hygiene products, pantyhose and\nThe ethics of selling a\ncontroversial or unsafe bras, laxatives, condoms, and remedies for male erectile dysfunctions have become acceptable,\nproduct lies with the although advertising for them may still be offensive to some people.\nmarketing department; Some products are controversial for political reasons or because of environmental issues.

The Shell ad, which comes from Iceland, is an example of a\ncriticized because it is the company that is changing its practices to deliver on its social responsibility mission.\nvisible face of marketing.\nUnhealthy or Dangerous Products One way to make ethical decisions is to choose the route that\nminimizes potential harm. Because there has been so much negative publicity about the health ef-\nfects of eating a steady diet of heavily processed food, food companies, particularly fast-food pro-\nducers such as McDonald’s and KFC, have reacted to charges of culpability in the nation’s obesity\nproblem. McDonald’s slimmed down Ronald McDonald, added healthier choices to its menu, and\nmoved away from using cholesterol-causing saturated fats when making French fries. Disney\nlaunched efforts to serve healthier food in its theme parks as an effort to improve the diets of chil-\ndren. Wendy’s reduced the amount of trans fats it uses for cooking.22\nOne of the most heated advertising issues in recent years has been about tobacco advertising.\nAlthough Congress passed a law that banned cigarette advertising on television and radio starting\nin 1971, that did not resolve the issue. Proponents of the ban on cigarette advertising argue that\nsince cigarettes have been shown to cause cancer as well as other illnesses, encouraging tobacco\nuse promotes sickness, injury, or death for the smoker and those inhaling secondhand smoke. They\nargue that further restricting advertising on those products would result in fewer sales and fewer\nhealth problems for America as a whole.\nOpponents of advertising bans counter with the argument that prohibiting truthful, nondecep-\ntive advertising for a legal product is unconstitutional and a violation of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
