In contrast, English is a low-context\nwhere the meaning of a sentence\nis not so dependent on surrounding language—most of its words have clearly defined meanings that are not highly dependent\nsentences. on the words surrounding them. Figure 18.5lists cultures from the highest to lowest con-\ntext, with Japanese being the highest context culture. This model helps explain the diffi-\nculties of advertising in other languages.\nAdvertising messages constructed by writers from high-context cultures might be difficult\nto understand in low-context cultures because they may offer too much detail to make the point\nclearly. In contrast, messages authored by writers from low-context cultures may be difficult to\nunderstand in high-context cultures because they omit essential contextual detail.\nCentral Control versus Local Adaptation As noted previously, some marketers develop tightly\ncontrolled global campaigns with minimum adaptation for local markets. Others develop local\ncampaigns in every major market. Most companies are somewhere in the middle. How are global\ncampaigns created? International advertising campaigns have two basic starting points: (1) suc-\ncess in one country and (2) a centrally conceived strategy. Planning approaches also include vari-\nations on the central campaign and bottom-up creativity:\n• Local InitiativeAsuccessful campaign, conceived for national application, is modified for\nuse in other countries. Wrigley, Marlboro, IBM, Waterman, Seiko, Philips, Ford, and many\nother companies have taken successful campaigns from one country and transplanted them\naround the world, a practice called search and reapply. When a local campaign is found to\nbe successful, that campaign is taken to one or two countries that are similar to see how well\nthe campaign works in these areas. If it is successful, use of the campaign is expanded and\ncan eventually become the brand’s primary international campaign. What is interesting about\nthis strategy is that it provides additional motivation for local agencies. While all local agen-\ncies want to do a good job to keep their local business, it is a major ego boost—not to men-\ntion the additional financial awards—when a local campaign is taken beyond its original\ncountry’s borders.\nThe Honda CR-Vis an example. As Logason explains, “Because of the effectiveness of\nthe original campaign—both the insights behind the strategy and the idea of ownership of\nthe 4(cid:5)4 concept, which was so successful in Iceland—the campaign caught the eye of the\nglobal office, and it has been distributed and showcased globally to dealers in other markets\nas an example of strong, clever positioning.”\n• Centrally Conceived CampaignsThe second approach, a centrally conceived campaign, was\npioneered by Coca-Cola and is now used increasingly in global strategies. Microsoft uses a\ncentralized strategy for its Xbox video game system; since it was a new brand, a consistent\nCHAPTER 18 • THE IMC UMBRELLA 567\nmarketing strategy was deemed to be essential. Although the centralization concept is sim-\nple, its application can be difficult. Awork team, task force, or action group (the names\nvary) assembles from around the world to present, debate, modify, if necessary, and agree on\na basic strategy as the foundation for the campaign. Cost is a huge factor. If the same pho-\ntography and artwork can be used universally, this can save thousands of dollars over each\nlocal variation.\n• Variations on Central CampaignsVariations on the centrally conceived campaign also\nexist. For example, BBDO’s many local agencies were used to adapt the creative ideas\nfor all the markets served by DaimlerChrysler (now Chrysler after the company split).\nThe office that develops the approved campaign would be designated the lead agency\nand would develop all the necessary elements of the campaign and prepare a standards\nmanual for use in other countries. Because photography, artwork, television production,\nand color printing are costly, developing these items in one location and then overlaying\nnew copy or rerecording the voice track in the local language saves money. However, be-\ncause some countries, such as Malaysia, require that all campaign materials be locally\nproduced, this approach gives direction to the message but still allows for local require-\nments to be met.\n• Bottom-Up CreativitySometimes a competition may be used to find the best new idea. For\nexample, to extend McDonald’s “I’m Lovin’It” campaign, McDonald’s global chief market-\ning officer held a contest among McDonald’s ad agencies all over the world. One winner,\nwhich became part of the international pool of ads, came from China, which is developing a\nlively creative advertising industry that produces edgy, breakthrough ads for young people.\nMcDonald’s strategy was not just to do the creative work in the United States but rather to\n“Let the best ideas win.”\nPlanning International Strategies\nAssuming that the campaign has been approved centrally, with a local application approach, its\nexecution must be adapted to suit the local market, and that may involve modifying basic strat-\negy decisions, such as objectives, targeting, and perhaps even positioning.\nInternational Objectives The problem of managing brand consistency is largely responsible for\nlimiting most international or global marketing objectives to awareness and recall, two effective\nyet easily attainable marketing communication measures, although more specific objectives may\nbe needed in individual markets. For example, a brand may be well known in one market, so its\nprimary objective, then, is reminder. At the same time it may be newly launched in another coun-\ntry, so the objectives there are awareness building and trial.\nTargeting Issues International marketers need to answer three basic targeting questions: (1) What\ncountries?
