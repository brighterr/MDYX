Ajudge can order any of the following: cancellation or reformation of contracts,\nrefund of money or return of property, payment of damages, and public notification.\nMedia Review of Advertising\nThe media attempts to regulate advertising by screening and rejecting ads that violate their stan-\ndards of truth and good taste. Most networks have a Standards and Practices Department that\nscreens every ad and gives approval before the ad can run. Each individual medium has the dis-\ncretion to accept or reject a particular ad. For example, Reader’s Digestdoes not accept tobacco\nand liquor ads, and many magazines and television stations do not show condom ads. The major\ntelevision networks craft their own standards and guidelines.\nThe First Amendment gives any publisher the right to refuse to publish anything the com-\npany does not want to publish, and this sometimes creates battles between media companies and\nadvertisers. For example, some billboard companies in Utah refused to run billboards for a\nWasatch Beer company brand named Polygamy Porter. The brand’s slogan “Why have just one!”\nand headlines such as “Take Some Home for the Wives” were deemed offensive to the state’s\nMormon population. Asimilar brouhaha arose when the state’s Brighton Ski Resort promoted its\nfour-person lifts with a billboard during the Salt Lake City Olympics that read “Wife. Wife. Wife.\nHusband.” The billboard company that banned the beer ads received letters both for and against\nits stand, which indicates the difficulty of such decisions.\nSelf-Regulation\nRather than wait for laws and regulatory actions, responsible advertisers take the initiative and\nestablish individual ethical standards that anticipate and even go beyond possible complaints.\nSuch a proactive stance helps the creative process and avoids the kinds of disasters that result\nfrom violating the law or offending members of society.\nAdvertisers practice three types of self-regulation: self-discipline, industry self-regulation,\nand self-regulation by public and community groups.\nSelf-Discipline An organization such as an advertising agency exercises self-discipline when it\ndevelops, uses, and enforces norms within its own practices. Self-discipline starts with the indi-\nviduals in the agency or organization. It is each person’s responsibility to recognize ethical issues\nand be intentional about their behavior. We hope that this chapter will help you think about mak-\ning choices that you deem the right thing to do in your career.\nVirtuallyallmajoradvertisersandadvertisingagencieshavein-houseadreviewprocedures,\nincludingreviewsbyagencyandclientattorneys.Theseemployeeshelpensurethatworkislegal.\nTypicallytheattorneysareconcernedwithhowclaimsarephrasedandsubstantiated.Aretheclaims\nverifiable?Isthereresearchanddatatoprovethetruthoftheclaims?Isthereanythingintheword-\ningthatcouldbemisinterpretedormisleading?Isthereanythingdeceptiveinthevisualimages?\nSeveral U.S. companies (Colgate-Palmolive, General Foods, AT&T) have their own codes\nof behavior and criteria that determine whether advertisements are acceptable. Companies with-\nout such codes tend to have informal criteria that they apply on an ad-by-ad basis. At a minimum,\nadvertisers and agencies should have every element of a proposed ad evaluated by an in-house\ncommittee, lawyers, or both.\nIndustry Self-Regulation When the development, use, and enforcement of norms comes from the\nindustry, the term used is industry self-regulation.In the case of both advertisers and advertising agen-\nCHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY 89\nFIGURE 3.4\nAdvertiser Appeals\nto NARB The NARB Appeal Process\nConsumers or groups submit-\nting a complaint to NAD and\nNARB go through this\nNARB Panels Review process.

In 1971 several professional\nadvertising associations in conjunction with the Council of Better Business Bureaus established the\nNational Advertising Review Council, which negotiates voluntary withdrawal of national advertis-\ning that professionals consider deceptive. The National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Council\nof Better Business Bureaus and the National Advertising Review Board (NARB) are the two operat-\ning arms of the National Advertising Review Council. None of these are government agencies.\nNAD is made up of people from the field of advertising. It evaluates complaints submitted\nby consumers, consumer groups, industrial organizations, and advertising firms. NAD also does\nits own industry monitoring. After NAD receives a complaint, it may ask the advertiser in ques-\ntion to substantiate claims made in the advertisement. If that substantiation is deemed inadequate,\nNAD representatives ask the advertiser to change or withdraw the offending ad. When a satis-\nfactory resolution cannot be found, NAD refers the case to NARB.\nNARBisa50-memberregulatorygroupthatrepresentsnationaladvertisers,advertisingagen-\ncies,andotherprofessionalfields.WhentheadvertiserappealsacasetoNARB,itfacesareview\npaneloffivepeople:threeadvertisers,oneagencyperson,andonepublicrepresentative.ThisNARB\npanelreviewsthecomplaintandtheNADstafffindingsand\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FTC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Federal Trade Commission is a U.S. government agency responsible for protecting consumers and ensuring a strong competitive market by enforcing antitrust and consumer protection laws)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>READER'S DIGEST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Reader's Digest is a magazine known for its selective advertising policies, such as not accepting tobacco and liquor ads)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WASATCH BEER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wasatch Beer is a company known for its controversial brand Polygamy Porter, which faced advertising challenges in Utah)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRIGHTON SKI RESORT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Brighton Ski Resort is a ski resort in Utah that faced controversy over its advertising during the Salt Lake City Olympics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT LAKE CITY OLYMPICS<|>EVENT<|>The Salt Lake City Olympics was an international multi-sport event held in Salt Lake City, Utah, during which Brighton Ski Resort faced advertising controversy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLGATE-PALMOLIVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Colgate-Palmolive is a U.S. company with its own advertising codes of behavior and criteria)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERAL FOODS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>General Foods is a U.S. company with its own advertising codes of behavior and criteria)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AT&T<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AT&T is a U.S. telecommunications company with its own advertising codes of behavior and criteria)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADVERTISING REVIEW COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Advertising Review Council is an industry group that promotes self-regulation in advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Better Business Bureau is an organization that helps establish industry self-regulation in advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVIEW COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Advertising Review Council is an organization that negotiates the voluntary withdrawal of deceptive national advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL ADVERTISING DIVISION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Advertising Division is part of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, evaluating complaints about advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVIEW BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Advertising Review Board is a regulatory group that reviews advertising complaints and decisions made by the NAD)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FTC<|>NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVIEW COUNCIL<|>The FTC is the ultimate authority that can be involved if the National Advertising Review Council's processes do not resolve an issue<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL ADVERTISING DIVISION<|>NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVIEW BOARD<|>The National Advertising Division refers unresolved advertising complaints to the National Advertising Review Board<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WASATCH BEER<|>BRIGHTON SKI RESORT<|>Both Wasatch Beer and Brighton Ski Resort faced advertising controversies in Utah<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRIGHTON SKI RESORT<|>SALT LAKE CITY OLYMPICS<|>Brighton Ski Resort's advertising controversy occurred during the Salt Lake City Olympics<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERTISING REVIEW COUNCIL<|>BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU<|>The Advertising Review Council was established in conjunction with the Better Business Bureau<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVIEW COUNCIL<|>NATIONAL ADVERTISING DIVISION<|>The National Advertising Division is an operating arm of the National Advertising Review Council<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVIEW COUNCIL<|>NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVIEW BOARD<|>The National Advertising Review Board is an operating arm of the National Advertising Review Council<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
