How\nmany additional exposures might that ad get? Because they are so visible, preferred posi-\ntions often carry a premium surcharge, usually 10 to 15 percent above standard space rates.\n• Demand Extra Support OffersWith the current trend toward using other forms of market-\ning communication in addition to advertising, buyers often demand additional promotional\nsupport. These activities, sometimes called value-added media services,can take any num-\nber of forms, including contests, special events, merchandising space at stores, displays, and\ntrade-directed newsletters. The “extra” depends on what facilities each media vehicle has\nand how hard the buyer can bargain.\nCHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 449\n• Monitor PerformanceAmedia buyer’s responsibility to a campaign does not end with the\nsigning of space and time contracts. The media buyer is responsible for tracking the perfor-\nmance of the media plan as it is implemented and afterward as part of the campaign evalua-\ntion. Buys are made in advance, based on forecasted audience levels. What happens if\nunforeseen events affect scheduling? What if newspapers go on strike, magazines fold, or a\ntelevision show is canceled? Buyers must fix these problems. Underperformance and sched-\nule problems are facts of life. Poorly performing vehicles must be replaced, or costs must be\nmodified. Buyers also check the publication issues to verify whether advertisements have\nbeen placed correctly. Buyers also make every attempt to get current audience research to\nensure that schedules are performing according to forecast. Media buyers are even found out\n“riding the boards,” which means they check the location of the outdoor boards to verify that\nthe client is receiving the outdoor exposure specified in the plan.\n• Postcampaign EvaluationOnce a campaign is completed, the planner’s duty is to compare\nthe plan’s expectations and forecasts with what actually happened. Did the plan actually\nachieve GRP, reach, frequency, and CPM objectives? Did the newspaper and magazine\nplacements run in the positions expected? Such analysis is instrumental in providing guid-\nance for future media plans.\n• Monitor Billing and PaymentBills from the various media come in continuously. Ulti-\nmately, it is the responsibility of the advertiser to make these payments. However, the\nagency is contractually obligated to pay the invoice on behalf of the client. Keeping track of\nthe invoices and paying the bills are the responsibility of the media buyer in conjunction\nwith the accounting department.\nIn addition to negotiating, bargaining, buying, and monitoring the execution of a media plan,\nmedia buyers also have to deal with situations that crop up and complicate the planning. In effect,\nthey are also troubleshooters. Buyers deal with the temporary snags in scheduling and in the repro-\nduction of advertising messages that are sometimes unavoidable. Buyers must be alert for missed po-\nsitions or errors in handling the message presentation and ensure that the advertiser is compensated\nappropriately when they occur. Apolicy of compensating for such errors is called “making good on\nthe contract,” known as make goods.Here are some of the common problems they may run into:\n• Program PreemptionsSpecial programs or news events sometimes interrupt regular pro-\ngramming and the scheduled commercials. In the case of long-term program preemptions,\nsuch as war coverage, buyers may have difficulty finding suitable replacements before the\nschedule ends.\n• Missed ClosingsMagazines and newspapers have clearly set production deadlines, called\nclosings, for each issue. Sometimes the advertising materials do not arrive in time. If the\npublication is responsible, it will make good. If the fault lies with the client or the agency,\nthe publication makes no restitution.\n• Technical ProblemsTechnical difficulties are responsible for numerous goofs, glitches, and\nfoul-ups that haunt the advertiser’s schedule. Bleed-throughs(the printing on the back side\nof the page is visible and conflicts with the client’s ad on the front side) and out-of-register\ncolor(full-color printing is made from four-color plates, which sometimes are not perfectly\naligned) for newspapers, torn billboard posters, broken film, and tapes out of alignment are\ntypical problems.\nThemediabuyer’slifegotevenmorecomplicatedin2010withthelivebroadcastoftheAcad-\nemyAwardswhereE!EntertainmentandGoogleworkedfeverishlytomakereal-timeplacements\nthatwouldmatchthedramaplayingoutonstage.TheE!onlinechannelwasabletoalteritsOscar-\nrelatedadswithinminutestoreflectnotjustthewinners,butalsothecontentofthespeeches,theon-\nstageevents,whatthepresenterswerewearing,andotherfeaturesofthecoverage.17\nMultichannel Buying (and Selling) It should be clear from this review of media buyers’re-\nsponsibilities that this is a challenging job.
