PR Newswire, U.S. Newswire, and BusinessWire are services that provide tar-\ngeted distribution to special-interest media outlets or handle mass distribution of news releases,\nphotos,graphics, video, audio, and other materials. If your organization decides to use e-mail, here\nis a set of guidelines for delivery:31\n• Use one reporters name and address per “to” line.\n• Keep subject line header simple.\n• Boldface“FOR IMMMEDIATE RELEASE” on the first line above the date.\n• Catch attention with a good headline.\n• Limit length (shorter than print’s 500-word limit).\n• Use the 5Wformat.\n• Do not include attachments.\n• Link to a URLwhere other background information and photos are posted.\n• Remember readability and use short paragraphs, bullets, numbers, and lists to keep it scannable.\n• Put contact information below the text.\n• Close with conventional end signs such as “30” or “######.”\n476 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nVideo news releases (VNRs)contain video footage for a television newscast. They are ef-\nfective because they show target audiences the message in two different video environments: first\nas part of a news report and then reused later in an advertisement. Of course, there is no guaran-\ntee that a VNR will be used. One study found that VNRs aired in the Miami market were used be-\ncause they had high visual quality and simple stories.32 The online video channel Skype also\noffers a new way to deliver VNRs.\nPitch Letters Ideas for feature stories,which are human interest stories rather than hard news\nannouncements, have to be “sold” to editors. This is done using a pitch letterthat outlines the\nsubject in an engaging way and sells a story idea. Companies use this form to feature interesting\nresearch breakthroughs, employees, or corporate causes. Not only is the distribution of press re-\nleases moving online, so are the letters pitching editors with story ideas. Ragan Communications,\npublisher of Interactive Public Relations, lists some tips for getting reporters and editors to read\ne-mail pitch letters in the Practical Tipsbox.\nPress Conferences Apress conference—an event at which a company spokesperson makes a\nstatement to media representatives—is one of the riskiest public relations activities because the\nmedia may not see the company’s announcement as being real news. Companies often worry\nabout whether the press will show up for a press conference. Will they ask the right questions, or\nwill they ask questions the company cannot or does not want to answer?\nTo encourage reporters to cover press conferences, companies may issue a media kit,usu-\nally a folder that provides all important background information to members of the press, either\nbefore or when they arrive at the press conference. The risk in offering media kits (also called\npress kits) is that they give reporters all of the necessary information so that the press conference\nitself becomes unnecessary.\nMedia Tours Amedia touris a press conference on wheels. The traveling spokesperson makes\nannouncements and speeches, holds press conferences to explain a promotional effort, and offers\ninterviews.\nPublications\nOrganizations may provide employees and other publics with pamphlets, booklets, annual re-\nports, books, bulletins, newsletters, inserts and enclosures, and position papers.\nPRACTICAL TIPS\nHow to Write E-Mail Pitch Letters\n1. Never list all recipients in the “To” line. No one and other resources, and with contacts, so they can\nwants to see all the reporters who received the round out the story.\npitch, since these story ideas are supposed to be 5. Make it personal. Use their first names and mention\nmade available to the medium on an exclusive the publication name.\nbasis—inotherwords,noothermediumwillbeof- 6. Keep subject-line headers to fewer than four or five\nferedthatstory. words. The header should be clear\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARLINGTON COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Arlington County is a location involved in the development of transit-oriented projects with Kettler)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KETTLER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kettler is a leading developer of mixed-use residential and commercial properties in the Washington Metropolitan area, celebrating its 30th anniversary in 2007)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PENTAGON CITY<|>GEO<|>Pentagon City is a location where Kettler has developed several residential projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE METROPOLITAN AT PENTAGON CITY<|>EVENT<|>A residential development by Kettler in Pentagon City, delivered 325 units in 2002)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE METROPOLITAN AT PENTAGON ROW<|>EVENT<|>A residential development by Kettler in Pentagon City, delivered 326 units in 2005)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE GRAMERCY AT METROPOLITAN PARK<|>EVENT<|>A 399-unit apartment building by Kettler in Pentagon City, nearing completion and set to open in the summer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT A.M.
