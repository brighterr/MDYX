Viewers also have to\nCHAPTER 10 • VISUAL COMMUNICATION 313\nwear special glasses. The 3-D technique has been around for many years but only with the big\nsuccess of the movie Avatar did it achieve wide popularity. ESPN launched a 3-D Channel in 2010\nfor the World Cup broadcast and persuaded major advertisers such as Procter & Gamble and Sony\nto experiment with 3-D spots on the new channel.\nMusic and Action Specifying the music is usually done as part of the copywriting; however,\nmatching the music to the action is an art director or producer’s responsibility. In some cases, as\nin high- production song-and-dance numbers, the music is the commercial. Other times, it is used\nto get attention, set a mood, and lock the commercial into memory.\nFor example, a recent JanSport commercial for its Live Wire Euphonic Pack, a backpack\nwith built-in earphones and volume controls, cries out for a musical demonstration. The unlikely\nsong picked for the spot, which targets the MTVcrowd, was “Do-Re-Mi” from the 1959 Sound\nof Music musical. You might wonder why the creative team at the DDB Seattle agency would\nchoose such a piece. Actually the rendition is not from the early recording but rather an ethereal,\ntechno-pop version. The stick-in-the-head lyrics match the action on screen in a contemporary\nversion of the classic story boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl.9\nThe TV Production Process\nFor the bigger national commercials, the steps in the TVproduction process fall into four cate-\ngories: message design, preproduction, the shoot, and postproduction. Figure 10.6 shows the\nsteps in the process.\nPreproduction The producer and staff first develop a set of production notes,describing in de-\ntail every aspect of the production. These notes are important for finding talent and locations,\nbuilding sets, and getting bids and estimates from specialists. In the “Cat Herders” commercial,\nfinding the talent was critical. Some 50 felines and their trainers were involved in the filming.\nSurprisingly,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
