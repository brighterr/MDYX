Be-\nfore we talk about specific types of studies, consider first the various copytesting services and the\nfactors they feel are important to evaluate.\nCHAPTER 19 • EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS 583\nTable 19.1 Effectiveness Research Questions\nEffect Research Questions\nPerception\nAwareness/noticed Which ads do you remember seeing?\nWhich ads were noted?\nAttention What caught your attention?\nDid the ad stand out among the other ads and content around it?\nWhat stood out in the ad?\nRecognition (aided) Have you seen this ad/this campaign?\nSort elements into piles of remember/don’t remember.\nRelevance How important is the product message to you? Does it speak to your interests and aspirations?\nEmotional/affective What emotions did the ad stimulate?\nHow did it make you feel?\nLiking/disliking Do you like this brand? This story? The characters (and other ad elements)?\nWhat did you like or dislike about the brand? The ad?\nDesire Do you want this product or brand?\nCognition\nInterest Did you read/watch most of it? How much?\nDid it engage your interest or curiosity?\nWhere did your interest shift away from the ad?\nComprehension/ What thoughts came to you? Do you understand how it works? Is there anything in the ad you\nconfusion don’t understand? Do the claims/product attributes/benefits make sense?\nDo you have a need for this brand or can it fulfill a need for you?\nRecall (unaided) What happened in the commercial? What is the main message? What is the point of the ad?\nBrand recall/linkage What brand is being advertised in this ad?\n[In open-ended responses, was the brand named?]\nDifferentiation What’s the difference between Brand X and Y?\nAssociation When you think of this brand, what (products, qualities, attributes, people, lifestyles, etc.) do you\nconnect with it?\nDo you link this brand to positive experiences?\nPersonality/image What is the personality of the brand? Of whom does it remind you? Do you like this\nperson/brand personality?\nWhat is the brand image? What does it symbolize or stand for?\nSelf-identification Can you see yourself or your friends using this brand?\nDo you connect personally with the brand image?\nPersuasion\nIntention Do you want to try or buy this product/brand?\nWould you put it on your shopping list?\nArgument/ What are your reasons for buying it? Or for not buying it—or its competing brand(s)? How does\ncounterargument it compare to competitors’ brand(s)?\nDid you argue back to the ad?\nBelievability/ Do you believe the reasons, claims, or proof statements?\nconviction Are you convinced the message is true? The brand is best?\nTrust Do you have confidence in the brand?\nBehavior How many people buy, try, call, send, click, visit, attend, inquire, volunteer, donate, advocate, or\nwhatever the desired action?\nWhat is the rate of change?\n584 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nCopytesting\nCopytesting companies have different specialties that focus on different effectiveness dimensions.\nThe most successful of these companies have conducted enough tests that they have developed\nnormsfor common product categories. In other words, after they pretest an ad, they can compare\nits score with scores from comparable ads. Norms allow the advertiser to tell whether a particular\nadvertisement is above or below the average for the brand or its product category. Without norms\nthe advertiser would not know whether a score of 23, for example, is good or bad.\nMost of these companies have also developed diagnostic methods that identify strong and\nweak points of the ad. Here is a list of some of the more prominent companies and the types of\ntests they provide:\n• Ameritest:brand linkage, attention, motivation, communication, flow of attention and emo-\ntion through the commercial\n• COMSCORE ARSgroup:persuasion, brand/ad recall, communication\n• Ipsos ASI:recall, attention, brand linkage, persuasion (brand switch, purchase probability),\ncommunication\n• Mapes&Ross:brandpreferencechange,ad/brandrecall,ideacommunication,keymes-\nsagedelivery,like/dislike,believability,comprehension,desiretotakeaction,attribute\ncommunication\n• Millward Brown:branding, enjoyment, involvement, understanding, ad flow, brand integra-\ntion, feelings about ad, main stand-out idea, likes/dislikes, impressions, persuasion, new\nnews, believability, relevance\n• RoperASW:overall reaction, strengths and weaknesses, understanding, clutter busting, at-\ntention, main message, relevance, appeal, persuasiveness, motivate trial, purchase intent.\nNow let’s consider how the services of such companies and the research they conduct can\nbe used at various points in the development and evaluation of a marketing communication ef-\nfort. This outline is based on the Facets Model of Effects that we first introduced in Chapter 4.\nMessage Development Research\nDeciding what facts to convey in marketing communication is never easy. Research is needed to\ndevelop and test alternative message strategies. Planners conduct research with members of the\ntarget audience to develop the message strategy and test the relative effectiveness of various sell-\ning premises—hard sell or soft sell, informational or emotional, and so forth\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMERITEST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ameritest is a company specializing in brand linkage, attention, motivation, and communication testing, focusing on the flow of attention and emotion through commercials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMSCORE ARSGROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>COMSCORE ARSgroup is a company that specializes in persuasion, brand/ad recall, and communication testing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IPSOS ASI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ipsos ASI is a company that focuses on recall, attention, brand linkage, persuasion, and communication testing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAPES & ROSS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mapes & Ross is a company that provides tests on brand preference change, ad/brand recall, idea communication, key message delivery, and more)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILLWARD BROWN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Millward Brown is a company specializing in branding, enjoyment, involvement, understanding, ad flow, brand integration, and more)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROPER ASW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Roper ASW is a company that focuses on overall reaction, strengths and weaknesses, understanding, clutter busting, attention, and more)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
