In-\nstead, a copywriter usually rewrites them in the second language. An ad for a Rome laundry\nshows how a poor translation can send the wrong message: “Ladies, leave your clothes here and\nspend the afternoon having a good time.”\nAlthough computer words and advertising terms are almost universally of English deriva-\ntion, some languages simply do not have words equivalent to other English expressions. Since\n1539 the French have had legislation to keep their language “pure” and now have a government\nagency to prevent words, especially English words, from corrupting the French language. The\nwordsmarketingandweekend,unacceptable to the French government agency, are translated lit-\nerally as “study the market” (or “pertaining to trade”) and “end of the week,” respectively.\nExperience suggests that the most reasonable solution to the language problem is to use\nbilingual copywriters who understand the full meaning of the English text and can capture the\nessence of the message in the second language. It takes a brave and trusting international creative\ndirector to approve copy he or she doesn’t understand but is assured is right. Aback translation\nof the ad copy from the foreign language into the domestic one is always a good idea, but it sel-\ndom conveys a complete cultural interpretation.\nThe most recent announcement on the global stage is the opening up of the Internet to non-\nRoman letters, such as those used in Chinese, Korean, and Arabic. It’s a challenge to develop\ntranslations for these languages so that a posting can be read in its original language, as well as\nin Roman letter alphabets, but the technology is making that possible.\nLooking Ahead\nThe most important enduring principle is that in a Big Idea the meaning emerges from the way\nthe words and images reinforce one another. We’ve explored the practices and principles of copy-\nwriting. In the next chapter we’ll introduce the role of the art director and explain the important\nrole of visual communication.\nIT’S A WRAP\nCows Build Moo-Mentum\nfor Chick-fil-A\nChick-fil-Aanditsadvertisingagency,TheRichardsGroup,developedoneofthemostsuccessfulintegrated\nbrand campaigns in the fast-food industry, one that has been executed across all media over many years.\nThestrategyisexpressedinthelineusedbywackycowswhodemandthatwe“EatMorChikin,”ratherthan\nhamburger.\nAfter the initial rollout as a three-dimensional billboard, the campaign continued to evolve and make its\nway into every point of contact with the customer. A standup cow became part of the in-store kit, along with\nbanners, table tents, cups, bags, and register toppers. The campaign has added direct mail and ads, promo-\ntions, events, TV, radio, the Internet, clothing, and merchandise. Calendars have been so popular that pro-\nduction numbers have topped 2.4 million. Anyone brave enough to show up at one of the chain’s restaurants\ndressed as a cow on the annual Cow Appreciation Day gets a free Chick-fil-A meal.\nCHAPTER 9 • COPYWRITING 285\nThe iconic cows and their quirky antics have become such a key symbol of Chick-fil-A’s marketing com-\nmunication that they were recognized as one of America’s most popular advertising icons in a public vote\nsponsored by Advertising Week. They even earned a spot on New York’s Madison Avenue Advertising Walk\nof Fame.\nChick-fil-A’s lighthearted, unconventional campaign has helped increase sales every year. Sales have in-\ncreased almost 600 percent since the campaign’s launch. Same-store sales more than tripled the precampaign\nlevels. Sales percentage increases beat the competition hoofs down.\nOh yes, the campaign also won a herd of awards, including induction into the Outdoor Advertising As-\nsociation of America’s Obie Hall of Fame, a Silver Lion at the Cannes International Advertising Festival, and\ntwo Effies, including one for its sustained success. That’s one way to milk the cows for all they’re worth.\nKey Points Summary\n1.What basic style of writing is used for advertising copy? consumers’interests.
