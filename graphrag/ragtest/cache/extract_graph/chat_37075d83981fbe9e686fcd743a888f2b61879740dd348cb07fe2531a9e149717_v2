Objectives that specify the impact the program\nseeks to have on the various publics can be evaluated by the PR manager if they contain bench-\nmarks and target levels.\nHowever, measuring the impact of public relations efforts has been difficult. It’s hard to\nknow what effect clips (or news stories about the company or organization) have on the bottom\nline, for example. Catalogs from retailers that feature over-the-top gifts have some value, even if\nthe items are never sold, because publicity has its own value. The theory is that even consumers\n482 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nwho don’t purchase the swanky gifts like a $1.8 million Virgin Galactic Charter to Space, avail-\nable through Neiman Marcus, still want to be associated with such luxury.43It is also difficult to\nseparate the effects of public relations from advertising or direct mail. In an effort to solve this\nproblem, Procter & Gamble has developed an analytic tool to quantify the sales impact of public\nrelations. In the end, public relations activities need to be evaluated against specific objectives es-\ntablished in the public relations plan.\nRapid changes in the media environment further complicate measurement metrics. The Pub-\nlic Relations Society of America has convened a group of experts to collaborate and recommend\nstandardized methods to measure program effectiveness.44\nFigure 15.2illustrates that various public relations tactics are controlled, semi-controlled, or\nuncontrolled messages. They all play a role in a communication campaign plan. The model iden-\ntifies perception, emotion, cognition, persuasion, association, and behavior as categories of ef-\nfects that might need to be measured in an evaluation program.\nIn the past, public relations practitioners have tracked the impact of a campaign in terms of\noutput (how many news releases led to stories or mentions in news stories) and outcome (attitude\nor behavior change). PR firms and companies have hired companies such as BurellesLuce that\nspecialize in monitoring media coverage. Such tracking and the evaluation of attitude and be-\nhavior change is done to prove the effectiveness of the PR program, so that they can learn from\ntheir efforts and fine-tune future campaigns. To get a comprehensive picture of PR’s impact, prac-\ntitioners evaluate process (what goes out) and outcome (media use, effect on the target audience).\nAlthough some still argue that not all the value of public relations programs is measurable,45\nothers claim that is it possible to increase the use of metrics to determine what impact the cam-\nControlled Media\nfact sheets, advertising, direct response, employee\ncomm., personal comm., speeches, Web sites\nPerception Emotion\nexposure, empathy, concern\nawareness liking\nCognition\nPersuasion\nunderstanding of\nbelief, positive\ncompany,\nattitude\ncampaign\nBehavior\nAssociation participate,\nself-identity advocate, refer\nSemicontrolled Media Uncontrolled Media\npublicity (company initiated), meetings, events, news stories (media initiated), online chat groups\nsponsorships, buzz and blogs, competitor\nFIGURE 15.2\nCommunication Campaign Plan\nThis variation of the Facets of Effects model shows that even in public relations the media and messages must work together to deliver communications\nobjectives.\nCHAPTER 15 • PUBLIC RELATIONS 483\npaign is having on sales and business. The public relations community is rethinking the impact\nof digital and social media.46Some key concerns are integrating how results from traditional and\nnew media affect the results of the whole campaign and moving from a mind-set that considers\nimpressions to one that looks at engagement and conversion rates.\nLooking Ahead\nThis is the first in a set of chapters that focuses on specific marketing communication areas. In\nthis chapter we reviewed the practice of public relations, as well as its specialty areas, planning\npractices, and tools. The next chapter will look at direct-response practices.\nIT’S A WRAP\nMilestones\nfor Hampton’s\nLandmark Campaign\nIn this chapter you’ve read about the importance of earning a good reputation. Goodwill is invaluable. But\ncompanies can’t thrive on goodwill alone. It is also essential for an organization to be profitable. The Hamp-\nton Hotels “Save-A-Landmark” campaign achieved its goal of creating awareness, which, in turn, increased\nhotel revenue and generated goodwill.\nHampton Hotels earned its good reputation, in part, by becoming a civic-minded industry leader and\nhelpingrestoremorethan40landmarks,whicharelivingsymbolsofAmericaningenuity,pride,andhistory.\nThiscampaignhelpedstrengthenrelationshipswithitspublics:itsguests,itscommunities,anditsemployees.\nMedia took notice of these good works, with major news organizations, magazines, and newspapers cov-\nering the Save-A-Landmark project. In 10 years, the program has generated an estimated nearly 5.3 billion in\nmedia impressions and resulted in close to $25 million in ad equivalency for the brand.\nTwo weeks after the campaign launched, the Save-A-Landmark website generated nearly $70,000 in on-\nline bookings and more than $700,000 in its first year. The site has since resulted in more than $3 million of\nincremental revenue for the brand.\nFor these outstanding efforts the “Save-A-Landmark” campaign received much recognition.
