About half\nof those labeled “very playful” were most likely to eat a lot of Cheetos, and the\n“least playful” were also least likely to consume the product.\nFrom literature on cultural trends, the agency was able to define an emerging\ngroup of people who were likely to be passionate for Cheetos. A book by Christo-\npher Noxon1 identified a new breed of adults called “rejuveniles.” These are the\nfolks who think playing isn’t just for kids. Yankelovich, a leading consumer research\nfirm, confirmed the emerging trend of adults who liked being just a tad naughty\nand child-like regardless of their age. These people identified with brands such as\nDisney, Wii, Lego, and, not surprisingly, Cheetos.\nCheetos’ agency, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners synthesized information from\nthese research efforts and came up with a Big Idea. The new adult target, “rejuve-\nniles,” could “bend the rules with mischievous fun.” The tone of the campaign was\nedgy fun for adults rather than the sweet fun that had been used for kids. The big\nidea played out in a campaign that might not appeal to everyone, but it sure did\nto the target audience. Three TV spots illustrated how the inner child could be re-\nleased with pranks involving Cheetos. One spot featured a woman at a laundromat\nwho’d been berated by another woman. To get revenge and encouraged by mas-\ncot Chester Cheetah, the young woman put a bag of orange Cheetos in the other\nwoman’s white load of wash.\nThe online component of the campaign, OrangeUnderground.com, encour-\naged adults to play mischievous pranks with the orange snacks by creating Ran-\ndom Acts of Cheetos. The only rule: the pranks had to be “benign and harmless,\nnever malicious or hurtful.” Cheetos partnered with Comedy Central for a promo-\ntion that encouraged fans to make mischief, video it, and post it to the website.\nThe interactive website itself features oddball humor with games, the Legend of\nCheetocorn, a giant Cheetos pet, and all sorts of crazy stuff.\nTheadlessonsfromthisCheetosstory?Sometimeswhatlookslikebadnews\nabout your product can lead to new opportunities that research can help you\nidentify. A more important lesson: stay true to your brand.

This research effort becomes the foundation for objective setting, segmenting the\nmarket and targeting the audience, and developing the brand communication plan. So now that\nwe understand the need for research, let’s talk about how to do it. This chapter presents some key\nresearch concepts, beginning with an explanation of the two most basic categories of research,\nprimary and secondary; the basic categories of research tools, quantitative and qualitative; and\nthe most common research methods used in planning marketing communication. We also discuss\nthe key challenges facing advertising researchers.\nHOW DO YOU FIND CONSUMER INSIGHTS?\nIn the previous chapter we talked about insight—in fact, an effective marketing communication\nprogram is totally dependent on consumer insight. Know your customer—and listening is the first\nstep in understanding customers.\nWhatdoesthatmean?Itmeansthatbrandstrategybeginswithconsumerresearch—thetools\noflistening.Consumerresearchinvestigatesthetopicswediscussedinthepreviouschapteron\nsegmentationandtargeting,includingattitudes,motivations,perceptions,andbehaviors.There-\nsearchfindingsthenleadtoplanningdecisionsbasedontheseinsights.Butfirstwemustunder-\nstand the principles and practices of advertising research and how to listen effectively to\nconsumers.\nIn-house researchers or independent research companies hired from outside the company\nusually handle a client’s market and consumer research. The objective at all stages of the plan-\nning process is to answer the question: What do we need to know in order to make an informed\ndecision? Here are the various types of research used in planning advertising and marketing com-\nmunication, such as the Cheetos campaign:\n• Market researchcompiles information about the product, the product category, competitors,\nand other details of the marketing environment that will affect the development of advertis-\ning strategy.\n• Consumer researchidentifies people who are in the market for the product in terms of\ntheir characteristics, attitudes, interests, and motivations. Ultimately, this information is\nused to decide who the targeted audience for the advertising should be.
