You’ll find that most of these areas have their own metrics by which per-\nformance is measured.\nEven though an IMC campaign is evaluated in terms of its overall impact on a brand, the\npieces of the mix may also be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of their performance. Ad-\nvertising may be the most visible; however, other marketing communication tools, such as sales\npromotion, are better at getting people to respond with an immediate purchase, and public rela-\ntions is particularly strong at building credibility. Let’s look briefly at these other marketing com-\nmunication areas in terms of their evaluation.\nMarcom Tools\nAsTable19.2illustrates,marketerscanusetheFacetsModelofEffectstoidentifytheobjectives\nPrinciple\ncommonlyassociatedwiththevariousmarketingcommunicationareasaswellasthetypesofmea-\nAdvertising is particularly\nsuresusedtoevaluateperformance.Theideaisthatcertainmarketingcommunicationfunctions,\neffective in accomplishing\nsuchaspublicrelationsandsalespromotion,dosomethingsbetterthanotherareas.Therefore,in\nsuch objectives as creating\nanintegratedplan,wewouldusethebesttooltoaccomplishthedesiredeffect.InTable19.2,the\nexposure, awareness, and\nmaineffectsarelocatedinthefirstcolumn,withacollectionofsurrogatemeasuresidentifiedinthe\nbrand image and\ndelivering brand secondcolumn(thislistisnotinclusive,it’sjustasample).Thelastcolumnliststhecommunica-\nreminders. tiontoolortoolsthatmaybemostappropriateforachievingtheobjective.\nAdvertising How do you describe effective advertis-\ning? You’ve been watching it for most of your life. One\nbrand manager’s answer to that question is presented\nin the Practical Tips at www.pearsonhighered.com/\nmoriarty. An examination of Table 19.2shows that ad-\nvertising is particularly effective in accomplishing a\nnumber of objectives, such as creating exposure,\nawareness, and a brand’s image. It is also good at pro-\nviding brand reminders to the customer and encourag-\ning repurchases. The preceding discussions about\ncopytesting, message development research, concur-\nrent testing, post-testing, and the evaluation of media\ncover the most common advertising methodologies.\nMany of these research methods are used by other\nmarcom areas, but they all are derived initially from\nadvertising.\nEvaluation doesn’t just happen at the end of a campaign or after\nthe ad is run. It has to be planned into the campaign from the Direct Response The objective of direct-response\nvery beginning as this planning meeting illustrates. communication is to drive a transaction or generate\nCHAPTER 19 • EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS 595\nTable 19.2 Message Effectiveness Factors\nKey Message Effects Surrogate Measures Communication Tools\nPerception Exposure Adv media; PR, PoP\nAttention Adv; sales promo (SP), packaging; PoP\nInterest Adv; SP; PR, direct; PoP\nRelevance Adv; PR; direct; PoP\nRecognition Adv; PR, packaging; PoP, specialties\nEmotional/Affective Emotions and liking Adv; SP, Packaging; PoP\nAppeals Adv; PR; sales; events/spnsrshps\nResonate Adv; PR; events/spnsrshps\nCognition Understanding Adv; PR; sales; direct\nRecall Adv; SP; PR, PoP, specialties\nAdv; PR; packaging\nAssociation Brand image Adv; PR; events/spnsrshps\nPersuasion Attitudes Adv; PR; direct\nPreference/intention Adv; PR; sales; SP\nCredibility PR\nConviction PR; sales; direct\nMotivation Adv; PR; sales; SP\nBehavior Trial SP; sales; direct, PoP\nPurchase SP; sales; direct\nRepeat purchase Adv; SP; sales; direct, specialties\nsome other type of immediate behavioral response, such as a donation or visit to a dealer. What\nPrinciple\nmakes this marketing communication tool so attractive to marketers is that response is so easily\nDirect-response\nmeasurable. Some advertisements request direct response via a toll-free number, a mail-in communication drives\ncoupon, a website or e-mail address, or an offer embedded in the body copy. Instead of depend- action and that makes it\ning on consumers’memories, measures of a message’s persuasive abilities, or some other indi- highly measurable.\nrect indication of effectiveness, the advertiser simply counts the number of viewers or readers\nwho request more information or buy the product.\nIn some ways, direct response mechanisms are the easiest marketing communication tool to\nevaluate both in terms of message effectiveness and in terms of ROI efficiency—the sales-to-cost\nratio. The efficiency of a direct-response offer is measured in terms of responses per thousand\n(RPM). To calculate the RPM, use the following formula:\nTotal responses\n(cid:5) 1,000 = RPM\nTotal mailed\nThiscalculationletsyoucomparetheresponserateofalternativemailings.Forexampleifone\nmailingof15,000pulled750responses,thentheRPMwas50per1,000.Ifadifferentmail-\ningof12,000pulled800responses,thentheRPMwas66per1,000,makingitamoreeffec-\ntiveoffer.\nSales Promotion Sales promotion programs for packaged goods and other products that use dis-\ntribution channels\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
