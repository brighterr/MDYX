Research think tanks are struggling to find better ways to measure consumers’\nemotional connections to brands and brands’relationships with their customers31and how those\nconnections and relationships are affected by various types of marketing communication mes-\nsages.

No\ncampaign uses all of them, but all successful campaigns have to do some kind of evaluation in order to de-\ntermine success. The Colorado Pass is an example of an IMC program that carefully monitors its marketing\ncommunication messages to evaluate the effectiveness of its brand-relationship building objectives. Jennifer\nWolfe-Kimbell, senior marketing manager at Vail Resorts, explains how this program has been evaluated.\nOur marketing mix for season-pass sales includes e-mail campaigns, direct-mail campaigns, online ban-\nner advertising, newspaper print in local and regional papers, local radio spots, and local TV spots. The passes\nare sold online and onsite at retail locations, resort ticket offices, and special events throughout Colorado and\nthe region.\nFiscal Year 2009 Results (Based on Third Quarter Results)The number of total season passes sold for the\n2008/2009 ski season was a 12.2 percent increase, which is greater than the increase in the number of passes\nsold for the 2007/2008 ski season. Combined with an 8.3 percent increase in the pass price, these results drove\na 21.8 percent increase in season-pass revenue.\nSeason-pass holders skied more on average in the 2008/2009 ski season than the previous year. They\nused the season pass an average of 10.6 times in 2008/2009 compared to 9.7 times per season pass in the\nprior season.\nFiscal Year 2010 Results (Based on Second Quarter Results)Vail Resorts experienced a $3.1 million or 6.2 per-\ncentincrease in total season-pass revenue including the Colorado Pass. The increase in season-pass revenue\nwas generated in spite of overall flat visitation from all skiers, as well as season-pass holders, and fewer visits\nper pass. This demonstrated the value of the program, even in periods of challenging snow conditions. Despite\nadverse factors such as historically low snowfall and a struggling economy, we were pleased with the outcome\nof our brand-relationship building efforts. This positive report on the company was attributed to the following:\n• The strength of the pass programs. In fact, decline in out-of-state visitation was mitigated by growth in vis-\nits from local season-pass holders, which was up 17 percent.\n• Higher guest expenditures on ski school and retail sales and rentals.\n• A 9 percent increase in the number of season passes sold. In fact, record season-pass sales locked in higher\nrevenue prior to the start of the season (despite fewer pass visits) further illustrating the strength and im-\nportance of our pass programs.\nOur pass holders loved the CPC Club—and Vail Resorts loved the results, as well.\nCHAPTER 19 • EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS 603\nKey Points Summary\n1.Why and how is marketing communication evaluation the achievement of the reach and frequency objectives, as\nconducted?Marketing communication evaluation is used well as the audience measurement reports of the media\nto test, monitor, measure, and diagnose the effectiveness of used.
