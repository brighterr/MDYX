This is typically based on a traffic\ncount—that is, the number of vehicles passing a particular location during a specified period of\ntime, called a showing. If an advertiser purchases a “100 showing,” the basic standard unit is the\nnumber of poster boards in each market that will expose the message to 100 percent of the mar-\nket population every day. If three posters in a community of 100,000 people achieve a daily ex-\nposure to 75,000 people, the result is a 75 showing. Conversely, in a small town with a population\nof 1,200 and one main street, one board may produce a 100 showing. As you can see, the number\nof boards required for a 100 showing varies from city to city.\nAdvertisers can purchase any number of units (75, 50, or 25 showings daily are common\nquantities). Boards are usually rented for 30-day periods, with longer periods possible. Painted\nbulletins are bought on an individual basis, usually for one, two, or three years.\nCHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 367\nOn-Premise Signs\nRetail signs that identify stores have been with us throughout\nrecorded history and are today the most ubiquitous form of\nbrand communication. Signs are found on small independent\nbusinesses, restaurants and chains like Starbucks, hospitals,\nmovie theaters, and other public facilities like zoos and large\nregional shopping centers. In this complex environment an\neffective sign may be relatively simple, like McDonald’s gi-\nant M, or more complex, like those found on the strip in Las\nVegas with their large illuminated and animated visual ex-\ntravaganzas.\nSome on-premise signs also act like billboards. Ameri-\ncan Eagle Outfitters, for example, has a 15,000-square-foot\nsign above its Broadway store in New York City. The sign\nhas 12 panels and operates 18 hours a day. The company Out-of-home advertising, such as this on-premise sign from\nhired ABC Regional Sports and Entertainment to handle Las Vegas, is a highly creative medium, as well as the\nsales for the panels.16 second fastest growing medium after the Internet. Every\nbuilding, every store, needs a sign.\nPosters\nPosters are used on kiosks, bulletin boards, the sides of buildings, and even vehicles. In London,\ndaily hand-lettered posters have been used for centuries to announce newspaper headlines, and\nthe walls of the subway or Tube stations in London are lined with posters advertising all kinds of\nproducts, but particularly theater shows. The iPod was launched in London with walls of posters\nthat Tube riders encountered coming up or down the escalators. The walls were papered with the\ndistinctive silhouetted images against their neon backgrounds.
