Forrester Research estimates\nthat four in five online adult users in the United States are involved with social media at least once\na month.43And new professionally focused interactive sites, such as LinkedIn, are specifically de-\nsigned to serve the business community.\nHow are social media involved in marketing communication? Facebook accepts ads and has\na section on its site about how to create Facebook advertising (www.facebook.com/advertising),\nas well as techniques to optimize your ads and track their performance. On Facebook advertisers\ncan either pay per click (CPC) or per thousand impressions (CPM).\nCompanies and brands now have Facebook and MySpace pages with their own brand pro-\nfiles just like any other member. Facebook fan pages for brands engage consumers who have\nquestions or who are loyal users. P&G, which has set up an office in Silicon Valley to develop so-\ncial networking sites for its many brands, says that the Pringles fan page has more than 2.8 mil-\nlion global fans.44Facebook marketers hope to make friends with interested consumers who visit\ntheir sites. These advertisers use video clips, quizzes, downloadable gifts like ring tones and\nicons, and, of course, links to their own websites. For example, eBay has a special “Student Su-\nperstore” page on Facebook called Half.com, a discount e-commerce site. Brand personalities,\nsuch as the Geico Gecko, are particularly useful as a featured character on Facebook. Check out\nhis page at www.facebook.com/pages/The-Geico-Gecko/167996161475.Off-the-Wall, new soft-\nware by Resource Interactive, makes it possible for companies to sell directly from their Face-\nbook walls, which moves social media into a new dimension of social marketing.\nH&R Block reached into the online tax filing space with a campaign that used a Facebook\npage, as well as a dedicated digital TVspot, blogs, a YouTube channel, apps, and widgets. An\narmy of 1,000 Tweeters will respond to the “Ask a Tax Advisor” buttons on the Block website,\nas well as answer questions directly and “listen” in on topics being discussed on community\nforums. Realizing the growing importance of online services, the company hopes to maintain its\npresence with digital filers, as well as support its stores and encourage filers to consult with its\nstaff of professional tax experts both online and in stores. The H&R Block campaign takes on\ndo-it-yourself competitor Intuit’s Turbo Tax, which has a long-standing, devoted online com-\nmunity of users.45\nPoliticians, who have been active users of websites, are also creating MySpace and Face-\nbook profiles with cool and funny things about themselves. Sarah Palin launched her\npost–Governor of Alaska career from her Facebook page. It is all about connecting on a semi-\npersonal level with a group of like-minded individuals to attract votes, volunteers, and donations.\nIn terms of marketing communication applications, most of these social media forms also\ncan be set up by organizations to engage stakeholders in brand conversations (employee blogs,\nfor example, or corporate Facebook pages) or, if outside the organization, consulted for buzz,\ntrends, and feedback about brand perceptions. The point is that social media marketing can in-\ncrease a brand’s Web presence and help manage its Internet image.\nVideo and Image Sharing One particular type of social media is the community sites where\nusers can post videos (YouTube, Google Video) and photographs (Flickr). YouTube is the Goliath\nof this genre with all kinds of videos from home shots of babies to parody commercials and brand-\nsponsored films. Launched in December 2005, the video-sharing service plays more than 100 mil-\nlionclips per day with some 65,000 clips uploaded daily. Visible Measures, which is a research\nfirm that tracks video viewing on YouTube and other video-sharing sites, found that Susan\nBoyle’s version of “Cry Me a River” accumulated a record-breaking 100 million views after her\nperformance on the Britain’s Got Talentshow.46\nCHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 409\nSkype is a video chat service that\nmakes it possible for friends, family mem-\nbers,andcolleaguesatfardistancestotalkin\nrealtime—likeavideophone,butthrougha\ncomputer or smart phone.

Ski mar-\nketers, for example, are using uploaded\ngeotargeted photos and videos to show real-\ntime snow conditions. Sprite is underwrit-\ning an interactive Web reality series on\nYouTube called “Green Eyed World,”\nwhich will follow British singer-songwriter\nKatie Vogel as she tries to break into the\nmusic world.
