Designed to deliver a groundswell of opinion, buzz, or marketplace\ndemand for a product, viral marketinguses e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter to circulate a message\namong family and friends. Depending on public interest in the topic, this practice can distribute\na message to an ever-widening network and messages can flash across the Internet like wildfire.\nRemember “The Diet Coke/Mentos Experiment” that resulted in a geyser of e-mails that ex-\nploded again and again on the Internet? That viral advertising was watched by millions, and guess\nwhat? Other viewers concocted their own versions and uploaded them on YouTube. Mentos mint\nsales rose 15 percent. Was that entertainment, or advertising and is its impact on the brand posi-\ntive or negative? Check out the YouTube version of this story at www.youtube.com/watch?v(cid:4)\nhKoB0MHVBvM.\nWhy Is Internet Advertising Growing So Fast?\nWhat makes Internet advertising so exciting and attractive to marketers is that it combines the\nbest aspects of traditional media. You will recall that the major benefit of TVadvertising is mo-\ntion, the benefit of direct response is interactivity, and one of the major benefits of print is its depth\nof information. An Internet ad provides all of these benefits, and often, at a much lower cost than\ntraditional media.\nAlthough the percentage of most marketing communication budgets spent on Internet ad-\nvertising is still relatively small, it is growing fast. In 2009, for example, the United Kingdom be-\ncame the first major economy in which marketers spent more on Internet ads than they did on\ntraditional TVadvertising.17In the United States analysts announced in 2010 that total U.S. dig-\nital advertising was about to surpass print—a major tipping point in the ascendancy of the Inter-\nnet over more traditional advertising media.18\nMost forms of online advertising weathered the recent recession better than most other forms\nof traditional advertising.19In fact, media research company ZenithOptimedia reports that the In-\nternet was the only medium to actually attract higher ad expenditures in 2009. The report also pre-\ndicts that by 2011, Internet advertising will increase from 10.5 percent of all ad expenditures to\n15.1 percent.20\nThe greatest percentage of Internet advertising is found on a small group of large, estab-\nlished sites that operate as electronic publishers, such as www.nytimes.com, www.WSJ.com,\nand www.ESPN.com, as well as on major search engines and service providers, such as\nGoogle, AOL, and Yahoo!. These media and search organizations have established reputa-\ntions, and they know how to sell advertising, so they have been pioneers in the development\nof Internet advertising.\nEven though Internet advertising was less affected by the recession, AOLand Yahoo! suf-\nfered from increased competition and both have been trying to rebuild their businesses by exper-\nimenting with new models of online content and advertising sales. AOL, for example, is using\nmassive amounts of tracking data to tell what Web search topics are most likely to attract audi-\nences. The system can also predict interest in news stories, which will give direction to its online\nnewsroom. Its new ad model also allows advertisers to partner with AOLcreative teams on con-\ntent development, either articles or videos. AOLand its partners may even mass produce digital\ncontent including “advertorials,” which are paid articles by advertisers.21\nOne area that is struggling to figure out its Internet advertising policies is pharmaceuticals.\nHeavily advertised—and regulated—in traditional media, drug manufacturers are unclear about\nwhat the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s policies are for online advertising. Even though\nhuge numbers of consumers search the Internet for health information, the pharmaceutical com-\npanies have been slow to advertise online because they are not sure what the disclosure require-\nments might be for this new medium.22\nWhen you slice the online advertising pie, advertising on search engines and on the sites they\ndeliver gets the biggest piece at 47 percent, followed by display advertising at 35 percent. Class-\nified advertising gets 10 percent, referrals and lead generation ads 7 percent, and e-mail adver-\ntising only 1 percent.23\n402 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nBanner and Display Ads Small ads on other Web\npages that lure visitors to switch pages are called\nbanner ads.Visitors can click on them to move to the\nadvertised website, such as the one featured here in a\nseries of animated banner ads for Zippo lighters. Ban-\nner ads are easy to create and are usually placed on a\nwebsite featuring complementary products or related\ntopics.\nAlthough banner ads were very popular when\nthey first appeared and continue to be a major part of\nonline advertising, the overall click-through rate has\ndropped to less than 1 percent. The most successful\nbanner ads achieve 5 to 7 percent click-through and\ncan help build brand awareness even if they don’t de-\nliver a high level of response.\nThe difference in click-through response lies in\nthe creativity and attention\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
