In the United States there has been a grad-\nual trend from blue-collar occupations (manufacturing, for example) to white-collar occupations\n(management and information). There have also been shifts within white-collar work from\nsalesto other areas, such as professional, technical, and administrative positions. The number of\nservice-related jobs continues to increase, especially in the health care, education, and legal and\nbusiness service sectors. Much of this transition is a direct result of computer technologies, which\nhave eliminated many labor-intensive, blue-collar occupations. This shift has affected advertis-\ning in a number of ways: today, advertisements seldom portray blue-collar jobs, for example.\nAnother key demographic indicator for many advertisers is income. You are meaningful to\nmarketers to the extent that you have the resources to buy their products or services or contribute\nCHAPTER 5 • SEGMENTING AND TARGETING THE AUDIENCE 143\nto their causes. The patterns of income distribution generally show that the most affluent 20 per-\nPrinciple\ncent has 50 percent of the total U.S. consumer income; the bottom income groups, which combined\nIncome is a key\ninclude 60 percent of the population, get by on about one-fourth of the total consumer income.21 demographic factor\nAdvertisers track trends in income, especially discretionary income,which is the amount because consumers are\nof money available to spend after paying for taxes and basic necessities, such as food and shel- meaningful to a marketer\nter. Some industries, such as movie theaters, travel, jewelry, and fashion, would be out of busi- only if they have the\nness if people didn’t have discretionary income. Discretionary income has been found to be a resources needed to buy\nmore reliable predictor of spending than income.22 the product advertised.\nFamily Status Age also relates to family status. The trends during the past 30 years have been\nfor people to increasingly be older when they marry, and the number of families also continues\nto shrink. Although families dominate American households, they are fewer in number than in\n1980. In data reported in 2009, 67 percent of the households were families and 33 percent were\nsingles. The composition of households is particularly important in media planning where many\nof the decisions are based on reaching households who subscribe or view programs, rather than\nindividuals. That’s because the media vehicles generally report their data, and compute their im-\npact (readers, users, viewers) based on household estimates.\nRace, Ethnicity, and Immigration In the United States, ethnicity is a major factor in segment-\ning markets. According to 2009 Census Bureau data, Hispanics make up 15 percent of the popu-\nlation and have overtaken African Americans at 13 percent as the largest ethnic group. African\nAmericans, however, have seen a dramatic increase of more than 55 percent in their buying power\nsince 2000.23Asians are 5 percent. Hispanics are the fastest growing minority, and the U.S. Cen-\nsus Bureau estimates that by 2050 they will make up 30 percent of the total population. These\nthree major categories make up more than a third of the U.S. population, that is, roughly one in\nevery three people are now minorities. All three groups are projected to make up more than half\nof the U.S. population in 2050.\nMulticultural strategies that recognize these trends have been important for a number of\nyears, but will dominate the practice of advertising in the midcentury. According to multicultural\nanalysts, “The U.S. is more multicultural than ever.”24What changes in advertising would you\nexpect to see as a result of such a dramatic change in the racial profile of the country?\nAfter nearly two years in a recession, the 2009\nannual survey found that for the first time in nearly\n40 years the foreign-born population declined with\nfewer low-skilled immigrants from Mexico and else-\nwhere. However, the survey found continuing in-\ncreases in high-skilled immigrants from India and\nother Asian countries.25 The survey also found that\nabout one in five U.S. residents spoke a language other\nthan English at home—mostly in California, New\nMexico, and Texas.26 In three metro areas—Miami,\nSan Jose, and Los Angeles—more than a third of resi-\ndents are foreign born. Data from Synovate’s Diversity\nMarkets Report, found that of all Hispanics, most were\n(56 percent) were U.S. born.27 This ad for Tide targets\nMedia use differences may also be based on ethnicity. For example, a Nielsen study found the Hispanic culture.\nThe translation is “The\nthat Hispanic viewers are more likely to watch commercials in their entirety than non-Hispanic\nsalsa is something you\nviewers.
