Thousands of apps are available that serve as links to other\nsites or provide some kind of immediate service, such as weather reports or current news. The\nnumber of iPhone apps now exceeds 100,000. The Google Droid operating system was launched\nwith a Google Map app as a point of competitive advantage.\nMarketers are particularly interested in branded apps, which are generally free but\nprominently linked to a brand. For example, REI has an app for snow reports. Zippo has a free\nvirtual lighter for iPhones that looks and acts like a real lighter. You can jerk the phone to open\nor close the Zippo and a little button let’s you light it with a simple flick. The point is strictly\nbrand identification but there is a bit of utility in using a cell phone for that Zippo moment in\nconcerts when people hold up their lights—in this case, images of a Zippo on their iPhones.\nIt’s almost a toy but the engagement with the brand has made the Zippo app one of the more\npopular ones.28\nOther apps offer more utility. Banks, for example, let you check balances, pay bills, make\ntransfers, and locate branches—and with the GPS navigation capability in some smart phones,\nthe app can even plot a route. AStarbucks app features a Starbucks location finder. Kraft’s app,\niFood Assistant, which is one of the few that comes with a price tag, provides recipes, cooking\ninstruction videos, meal shopping lists, and store locators. CNN also offers a functional app that\nprovides a 24-hour news feed with video for a one-time fee of $1.99.\nThe launch of Apple’s App Store propelled the development of thousands of branded apps.\nThe concept is showcased in some of Apple and AT&T’s full-page ads in publications that show\nthe iPhone with a suite of apps accompanied by callouts that explain what the apps do. You can\ncheck out the App Store at www.apple.com/iphone/apps-for-iphone/phone.\nOther New Media We have said before that media needs creative ideas just as much as the\ncreativesidedoes.Thereisacontinualsearchforanovelwaytogetconsumersengagedwith\nabrand.\nAs we mentioned in the discussion of mobile marketing, streaming videos from profes-\nsional media companies—including television programs and movies—are joining homemade\ncreations like those from YouTube and appear not only on personal computers, but also on smart\nphones, such as iPhones. Nintendo is now adding Netflix as streaming video to its Wii video game\nconsole.29These creations can be as engaging as anything on conventional television. For exam-\nple, CBS has created a cell phone app video game of America’s Next Top Modelwhere viewers\ncan play with animated versions of the show, pick dresses, and experiment with the stars’makeup.\n(See it at http://topmodel.pressokentertainment.com.)
