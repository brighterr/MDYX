Atrialis important for\nnew products and expensive products because it lets a customer use the product without\ninitially committing to a purchase. In other words, the risk is reduced. Sales promotion is\nparticularly good at driving trials through special price deals, sampling, and incentive pro-\ngrams that motivate behavior, such as a free gift when you go to a dealer to test drive a new car.\n• BuyingThe objective of most marketing programs is sales. In advertising, sales is some-\ntimes stimulated by the call to actionat the end of the ad, along with information on where\nto purchase the product. From a customer perspective, sales means making a purchase. In\ncustomer-focused marketing programs, the goal is to motivate people to try or buy a certain\nbrand. But in some marketing programs, such as those for nonprofit organizations, the mar-\nCHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 121\nketing program may be designed to encourage the audience to sign up,\nvolunteer, or donate. For many managers, however, sales is the gold stan-\ndard for effective advertising. They feel that, even if they are funny, mem-\norable, or entertaining, ads are failures if they don’t help sell the brand.\nThe problem is that it may be difficult to prove that a marketing communi-\ncation message is the one factor in the marketing mix that delivered the\nsales. It could be the price, the distribution, the product design and perfor-\nmance, or some combination of the marketing mix elements. Effectiveness\nprograms, such as the London-based Institute of Practitioners Award pro-\ngram (IPA), encourage advertisers to use research to prove that it was, in\nfact, the advertising that actually drove the sales.\n• ContactingTrying and buying may be the marketer’s dream response, but\nother actions also can be important measures of an advertisement’s behav-\nioral effectiveness. Responding by making contactwith the advertiser can be\nan important sign of effectiveness. Initiating contact is also valuable, particu-\nlarly in IMC programs designed to maintain brand relationships by creating\nopportunities for customer-initiated dialogue, such as encouraging customers\nwith a complaint, compliment, or suggestion to contact the company.\n• Advocating and ReferralsOne of the behavioral dimensions of brand loy-\nalty is advocacy,or speaking out on a brand’s behalf and referring to it\nwhen someone asks for a recommendation. Contacting other people is a\nvaluable response, particularly when a satisfied customer brings in more\nbusiness for the brand by providing testimonials to friends, family, and\ncolleagues on behalf of the brand. In terms of the impact of referrals,\nwhen a satisfied customer recommends a favorite brand, this form of word\nof mouth can be incredibly persuasive, more so than advertising, which is\nseen as self-serving. Apple Computer’s success is credited to its passionate\ncustomers who, as evangelists for the brand, spread the word among their\nfriends and coworkers.\nThisadvocacy level, which Smith and Cross describe in their book,\nCustomer Bonding,37represents the highest form of a brand relationship.\nArecommendation to buy a specific brand is the ultimate test of the bond\nbetween consumers and their favorite brands. And the opposite—brand\naversion—can be disastrous if the dissatisfied customer shares his or her\ndislike with other people.\n• PreventionInsomesocialactionsituations,advertisingmessagesarede-\nsignedtodeterbehaviors,suchasclean-aircampaignsthathopetoreduce\ncaruse.Thisisacomplicatedprocessthatinvolvescounterarguingbypre-\nsentingnegativemessagesaboutanunwantedbehaviorandcreatingthe\nproperincentivestostimulatethedesiredbehavior.Becausetheeffectsare\nsocomplicated,theimpactofsuchcampaignsisnotalwaysclear.Earlier\nintheperceptiondiscussionwementionedthenational“JustSayNo”\ncampaign,whichclaimstohavehadanimpactonteenagers’druguse.\nHowever,asCarsonB.Wagnerdiscovered,sometimesantidrugadvertis-\ningcanboomerangbecauseitcallsattentiontotheunwantedbehavior.\nTHE POWER OF BRAND COMMUNICATION\nThe six-factor Facets Model of Effects that we’ve been describing is our an-\nswer to the question of how advertising works.

You should remember two things about how this\n122 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nmodel works: (1) the effects are interdependent, and (2) they are not all equal for all marketing\ncommunication situations.\nIn terms of effects interaction, we suggested in the previous discussions that cognitive and\nemotional responses work together. Consider that memory is a function of both attention (the\nperception facet) and emotion (the affective facet). As du Plessis explains, “What we pay at-\ntention to, we remember.”38The stronger the emotional hook, the more likely we’ll attend to\nand remember the message. Even informative messages can be made more memorable if they\nare presented with an emotional story. Furthermore, recent ideas about how advertising mem-\nory works suggest that an effective ad helps consumers remember their best moments with a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
