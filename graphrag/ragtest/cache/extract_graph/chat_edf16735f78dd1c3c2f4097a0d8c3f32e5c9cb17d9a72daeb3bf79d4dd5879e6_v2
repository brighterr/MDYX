Because it’s efficient and cost effective. It costs money to reach peo-\nPrinciple\nple with a brand message and most marketers don’t want to spend money to reach people who\nSegmenting is efficient\naren’t interested in the category or brand. So segmenting does two things: it identifies those peo- and cost effective when it\nple who are in the market, but it also eliminates those who aren’t. identifies those people\nwho are in the market, but\nSegmentation Strategies also eliminates those who\naren’t.\nAt one point in its history, Coca-Cola viewed the U.S. market for its brand as homogeneous and\nused general appeals—such as “Coke is it!”—for all consumers, which is considered an “undiff-\nerentiated” strategy.But even Coke is sold in different types of places, and people hear about\nCoke through different types of media. Therefore, customers are grouped almost by definition,\nbased on their contact points with the product. Of course, there are also differences in age, for in-\nstance, between a long-time adult Coke drinker and a teenager.\nConsumer differences, as well as product variations, determine how marketers address peo-\nple in marketing communication and reach them using media. In other words, few examples of\nhomogeneous markets exist in contemporary marketing, consequently most strategies are based\non a market segmentationapproach that drives marketing communication strategies.\nBy using a segmentation strategy, a company can more precisely match the needs and wants\nof the customer with its products. That’s why soft drink manufacturers such as Coke and Pepsi\nhave moved away from an undifferentiated approach and introduced product variations to ap-\npeal to different consumer segments, such as diet, caffeine-free, diet caffeine-free, and flavored\n138 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nversions of their basic products. This approach also allows a company to target advertising mes-\nsages by more precisely matching the interests, attitudes, and preferences of consumers in each\nsegment of the soft-drink market.\nAlthough marketing has gone global to reach large markets, many advertisers have moved\ntoward tighter and tighter niche markets,which are subsegments of a more general market seg-\nment. Individuals in a niche market, such as ecologically minded mothers who won’t use dispos-\nable diapers, are defined by a distinctive interest or attitude. Instead of marketing to the masses,\nmarketers target narrow segments, such as single women in the international traveler category or\npogo-stick riders in the extreme sports category. Although large companies may develop niche\nstrategies, niche marketers are companies that pursue market segments of sufficient size to be\nprofitable although not large enough to be of interest to large marketers. Exploritas, for example,\nmarkets to seniors who are interested in educationally oriented travel experiences.\nConsumers in niche markets may be more passionate about their favorite brands than gen-\neral consumer markets. For example, Celestial Seasonings sells one variety called Roastaroma. It\nis a caffeine-free alternative to coffee. True to Celestial’s commitment to herbal ingredients,\nRoastaroma is made from roasted barley, chicory, and carob, as well as cinnamon, allspice, and\nChinese star anise. It’s not a popular flavor and has a low sales level, but when Celestial tried to\ndiscontinue the line, the company was flooded with letters from irate customers protesting the\ndecision—and Celestial Seasonings gave in to its small band of Roastaroma drinkers.\nTypes of Segmentation\nIngeneral,marketerssegmenttheirmarketsusingsixbroadcategoriesbasedonkeyconsumer\ncharacteristics.Thesixapproaches,illustratedinFigure5.3,aredemographics,lifestage,geo-\ngraphics, psychographics, behavior characteristics, and values and benefits sought (needs\nbased).Whichapproachorcombinationofapproachesisusedvarieswiththemarketsituation\nandproductcategory.We’lltalkaboutthecharacteristicsbehindthesesegmentsinthediscus-\nsionthatfollows.\n• Demographic Segmentationdivides the market using such characteristics as gender, ethnic-\nity, and income.

Age is a characteristic of life stage, as is living situation.\n• Geographic Segmentationuses location as a defining variable because consumers’needs\nsometimes vary depending on where they live—urban, rural, suburban, North, South. The\nmost important variables are world or global, region, nation, state, city, or zip code. Factors\nrelated to these decisions include climate, population density, and urban/rural character.
