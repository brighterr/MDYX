Yahoo!, for example, is a directory, or online guide to the Web. It started as a group of\nfavorite websites compiled by a couple of Stanford University students, who began catego-\nrizing the sites as the list grew into the giant library now known as Yahoo! It is considered\nthe top Internet brand and is among the most trafficked websites in the United States. The\nbig three portals—AOL, MSN, and Yahoo!—account for 17 percent of all time spent on the\nInternet in the United States. On average, MSN users spend 2 hours online daily, AOLusers\nspend 2.5 hours, and Yahoo users spend 3 hours. MSN, however, has the biggest global\nshare of the three and uses that advantage to drive its other products, such as Internet Ex-\nplorer, Windows, its Silverlight Web design application, and its Bing.comsearch engine.2\n• LinksAlinkis an address to another website that can be accessed from the website cur-\nrently being viewed. Often the links are designed to reflect the topic of the original site. For\nexample, Nike may have a link on a golf site that allows viewers to move back and forth\nfrom the golf page to Nike’s golf product lines.\n• Search EnginesGoogle is the biggest search engineused to find information and access\nother sites but it is being challenged by Microsoft’s Bing.com,which also powers Yahoo’s\nsearch function. You don’t have to know a specific website address; instead, you can type in\nakeywordand the search engine will seek out all sites that provide information on the topic.\nMost search engines also carry advertising, so they can be considered advertising media. Ex-\namples of more specific search sites are SeenOn.com,an online shopping guide that lets TV\nfans find and purchase many of the products they see on TV, and iLike.com,which was set up\nby musicians to help consumers find music they like. Craigslist provides local community-\nbasedinformation: who can repair a radio, where to find supplies for stained glass repairs,\nhow to locate job opportunities, and so on. Craigslist is noncommercial and doesn’t accept\nadvertising, but brands sometimes can be found there or searched for on the site.\n• NetcastingThe emergence of new technology that makes it possible to broadcast TVand ra-\ndio online is a practice called netcasting.Blip.tv offers new Web TVseries and helps the\nproducers find sponsors and advertisers. The decision by ABC to put previously run\nepisodes of its hit shows online and CBS’s experiments with “March Madness on Demand”\nvideo streams for the college basketball championships are pushing this technological revo-\nlution. MTVis working with Google to move its video content to the Web, and Disney has\nreleased some of its movies for use on a video iPod. TVproducers are starting to produce\nshows designed for the tiny 2.5-inch cell phone screen. In a new twist on convergence, a\nstart-up wireless carrier contributed a political parody show it created, the animated Lil’\nBush, to Comedy Central. This is the first time a U.S. TVnetwork broadcast a show that was\nCHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 393\ninitially produced for cell phones. Netcasting also appeals to advertisers searching for new\nways to reach audiences who no longer are sitting in front of televisions.\n• BroadbandThe term broadbandis used to indicate a high-speed connection to the Internet.\nSlow speeds make it difficult to download large files; higher speed access makes it easier to\naccess complex files, such as streaming video.Finland has targeted 2015 as the date when\nfast Internet connections will be guaranteed to all of its citizens. Other countries have similar\nplans, but as of 2010 the U.S. Congress was working through the FCC to catch up and de-\nvelop similar plans.3Bandwidthis a term used to describe the carrying capacity of an indi-\nvidual’s computer connection, that is, how much digital data it can handle.\nThe Internet Audience\nInternet use has expanded over the years from sites appealing to young tech-savvy innovators to\nsites devoted to just about any age or interest group. The most sought-after audience on the Web\ncontinues to be young people, particularly young males who are hard to reach with traditional me-\ndia. Teens spend more time online—or on their cell phones—than any other age group.\nArecentarticle,however,celebratednewsites,suchasBoomerGirl.com,thatreachwomen\noverage50withnews,blogs,and“tipsonhealth,fashion,family,finances,andfitness.”It’snotthe\nonlysiteforthispopulation:Boomerwomenspeak.comandeons.comfocusontheconcernsofboth\nmaleandfemaleboomers.Incertainmarkets,suchasfashion,65percentofonlineapparelsalesis\ntowomenoverage35.ThefastestgrowingsegmentofFacebookusersiswomenoverage55.4\nIn fact, the Internet is the ultimate niche medium in that people turn to it to find out about\nPrinciple\nany topic that interests them.
