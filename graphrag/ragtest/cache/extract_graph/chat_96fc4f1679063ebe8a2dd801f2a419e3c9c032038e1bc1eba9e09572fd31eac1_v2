To give you an idea of the\nmagnitude of the U.S. Postal Service’s responsibility, the Direct Marketing Association esti-\nmated spending on direct mail at $54 billion in 2008, even in a period of declining spending\non the medium.35Consumers who receive advertisements in the mail that they consider sex-\nually offensive can request that no more mail be delivered from that sender. The postmaster\ngeneral also has the power to withhold mail that promotes lotteries. Fraud can include a\nnumber of questionable activities, such as implausible, get-rich-quick schemes.\n• The States’Attorneys GeneralThe National Association of Attorneys General seeks to regu-\nlate advertising at the state level. Members of this organization have successfully brought\nsuits in their respective states against such advertising giants as Coca-Cola, Kraft, and\nCampbell Soup. More recently, numerous attorneys general have led the way against the to-\nbacco industry and have supported the advertising restrictions discussed earlier.\n86 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nThe Impact of Regulation\nIn our discussion of issues we mentioned several that have spurred governmental regulation, such\nas children’s advertising, deception, and claim substantiation.In this section we discuss these reg-\nulations in terms of the government agencies taking responsibility for them.\nThe FTC and Children’s Advertising Developing responsible advertising aimed at audiences of\nchildren is a critical issue. The FTC and other governmental agencies have gotten involved with\nthe regulation of marketing to children.\nAfter a 1978 study found that the average child viewed more than 20,000 TVcommercials\nper year, a heated debate ensued. One side favored regulation because of children’s inability to\nevaluate advertising messages and make purchasing decisions. The other side opposed regulation,\narguing that many self-regulatory mechanisms already existed and the proper place for restrict-\ning advertising to children was in the home.\nIn response, the FTC initiated proceedings to study possible regulations of children’s tele-\nvision. Despite the FTC’s recommendations, the proceedings did not result in new federal regu-\nlations until 1990. In the interim, self-regulation in the advertising industry tried to fill this void.\nThe National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc.,\nset up a group charged with helping advertisers deal with children’s advertising in a manner sen-\nsitive to children’s special needs. The Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU), established\nin 1974, evaluates advertising directed at children under the age of 12.\nIn 1990 Congress passed the Children’s Television Advertising Practice Act, which placed\n10.5-minute-per-hour ceilings for commercials in children’s weekend television programming\nand 12-minute-per-hour limits for weekday programs. The act also set rules requiring that com-\nmercial breaks be clearly distinguished from programming, barring the use of program characters\nto promote products.\nAdvocates for children’s television continue to argue that many stations made little effort to\ncomply with the 1990 act and petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to increase\nthe required number of educational programs to be shown daily. In 1996, broadcasters, children’s\nadvocates, and the federal government reached an agreement requiring all TVstations to air three\nhours of children’s educational shows a week.\nRegulating Deception Ultimately, advertisers want their customers to trust their products and ad-\nvertising, so many take precautions to ensure that their messages are not deceptive, misleading, or\nunreasonable.Deceptive advertisingis intended to mislead consumers by making claims that are\nfalse or by failure to make full disclosure of important facts, or both. The current FTC policy on\ndeception contains three basic elements:\n1. MisleadingWhere there is representation, omission, or practice, there must be a probabil-\nity that it will mislead the consumer.\n2. ReasonablenessThe perspective of the “reasonable consumer” is used to judge deception.\nThe FTC tests reasonableness by looking at whether the consumer’s interpretation or reac-\ntion to an advertisement is reasonable.\n3. InjuriousThe deception must hold the probability of material injury. Here, “material” is\ndefined as “affecting consumers’choice or behavior regarding the product or service.” In\nother words, the deception is likely to influence consumers’decision making about prod-\nucts and services.\nThis policy makes deception difficult to prove because the criteria are rather vague and hard to\nmeasure. It also creates uncertainty for advertisers who must wait for congressional hearings and\ncourt cases to discover what the FTC will permit.\nRegulatingSubstantiation AnareaofparticularconcerntotheFTCindeterminingwhetheror\nnotanadvertisementismisleadingisclaimsubstantiation.Theadvertisershouldhaveareason-\nablebasisformakingaclaimaboutproductperformanceorruntheriskofanFTCinvestigation.\nFoodclaims,suchasthosefocusedoncaloriesorcarbohydrates,mustbesupportedbyresearch\nabout nutrition.

In general, the FTC considers these factors:\n• Type and Specificity of ClaimFor example, Computer\nTutor claims you can learn the basics of using a com-\nputer by simply going through its three-CD set.\n• Type of ProductFedEx promises a certain delivery time,\nregardless of weather, mechanical breakdown, and so\nforth.
