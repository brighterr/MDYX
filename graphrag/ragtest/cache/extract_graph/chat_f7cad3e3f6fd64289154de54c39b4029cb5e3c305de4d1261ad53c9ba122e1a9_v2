Our bar coasters with cute definitions of\nThe Stupid Drink such as “the line between ‘I’m good’and ‘my bad’” and The Stupid Drink\nID stamp will allow bars to remind patrons to have a great time, but not to go beyond their\nstupid drink. If you are drinking beer in a bar, sooner or later you will visit the restroom\nwhere our Symptoms of Stupid bathroom posters will remind you that you don’t want to\nmake a fool of yourself by exhibiting one of these symptoms (e.g., dancing like a “pro” or\n“personal space invasion”).\nWe want to not only build a general awareness of The Stupid Drink idea, we want to\nget as close to the actual drinking situation as possible. We want The Stupid Drink message\nto be in the bars, in the fraternity parties, in the dorms—wherever college students go to\ndrink.\nPromotions and Public Relations\nCurbing binge drinking among college students is a huge task. We want to enlist the help\nof those who care the most about this. That’s why we created a website for college admin-\nAPPENDIX 609\nistrators to share their best practices with each other, and for parents to learn about what to\nexpect and how they can help their child become a responsible, safe independent adult.\nPress releases will celebrate the discovery of The Stupid Drink and campus events will\nhelp bring the message as close to the actual drinking event as possible. We developed a\n“Shoot Till You Miss” beer pong game but instead of beer, participants win prizes. But, hit\nthe middle glass, The Stupid Drink, and it’s game over. Urban Dictionary and Wikipedia\nentries for The Stupid Drink give it credibility and legitimacy.\nMedia\nThere is never enough money in advertising to accomplish all you want to, but by invest-\ning the money smartly you can maximize the impact of your plan. Our $10 million plan will\ngo a long way toward helping us curb binge drinking.\nTo stretch our budget, we divided the colleges into Tier 1 and Tier 2 schools based on\nalcohol consumption and size of campus (per The Princeton Reviewlist of “Party Schools”\nandPlayboy’s list of party schools). The Tier 1 schools would receive the full program with\nall advertising executions. Tier 2 schools would receive a reduced level in part because the\ndrinking problem isn’t as severe at these schools.\nAt Syracuse University, we no longer talk about “traditional vs. nontraditional” me-\ndia. With this generation, the world is their medium and anything is possible. Viral videos,\nwebsites, Facebook applications, mobile messaging, Twitter, bar coasters, search engine\noptimization, campus newspapers, postcards, stadium billboards, cable television (e.g.,\nMTV, ESPN, VH-1, and Comedy Central), dorm room stickers and posters, sidewalk\nclings, decks of cards, and bar stamps all worked together to deliver our message from\nAugust through May to 967 colleges and universities, 7,500,000 college students or 74%\nof the entire student population.\nBut will The Stupid Drink campaign curb binge drinking on college campuses? Our\npostevaluation research clearly demonstrated that 95% of college students understood our\nmessage and 89% reported that they actually thought about the idea while out drinking. If\nwe are right, almost no one reading this now will look at drinking too much in the same way\nagain.\nSyracuse University’s “The NewHouse Advertising Agency” student members include\nMaria Sinopoli, Paul Savaiano, Peter Ceran, Gregory Rozmus, and Erica Bruno on the pre-\nsenting team with strong support from Christina DiPhillips, Amanda Dwyer, Danielle Eck,\nLaurin Garbarino, Blair Gontowicz, Erica Gorlick, Ronald Hughes, Andrea Serra, Stephen\nShoemaker, Jonathan Smolin, Allison Yoest, Kate Overholt, David Ma, Alison Leung, Pam\nSidran, and Agatha Lutoborski.
