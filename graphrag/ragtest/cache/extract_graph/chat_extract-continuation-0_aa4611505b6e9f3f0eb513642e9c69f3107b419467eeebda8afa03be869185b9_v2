Also, the expanded use of English as an\ninternational language is helping spread Western marketing ideas to the rest of the world. The\n564 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nInternet has also had a huge impact on bringing the ability to\nmarket internationally to even the smallest of companies.\nStages of Marketing Development\nVirtually every product category can be divided into local, na-\ntional, regional (trading bloc), and international markets and\nbrands. Typically this involves a process that begins when a\nnational company expands to a few foreign markets by\nexportingits products. Then at the second stage it begins to in-\nternationalize its operations by selling to a group of markets in\na region (Europe or Asia, for example) and eventually moves\nto a global perspective, the third stage, with brands sold\nthroughout the world. An example of a company adopting an\ninternational perspective comes from the “World Peace” ad\nused by IBM in 1938.\nA characteristic of globalized companies is that the\ncountry of origin label often doesn’t apply. Nokia and Mo-\ntorola, even though they are not U.S. companies, are both fa-\nmiliar brands to U.S. consumers. Country of origin, however,\ncan be a problem as McDonald’s found out when its restau-\nrants were targeted because it represented America at a time\nwhen the country’s political actions were being criticized\nworldwide. McDonald’s has been boycotted in the Philippines\nand Argentina, as well as in many Arab countries—not for\nanything it does but simply because of its image as an iconic\nAmerican brand. Efforts by McDonald’s local franchisees\nhave included trying to present a local face by using its em-\nployees in traditional dress standing outside the store and by\nmaking contributions to local charities.\nCLASSIC The SPAR grocery store chain that we described earlier\nIBM used this “World Peace” ad to demonstrate its in the A Matter of Practice feature originated in the Nether-\ncommitment to world trade and the international marketing lands in 1932 and is now present in 33 countries on four con-\nof its products. tinents. The SPAR model is for each store to have its own\npersonality and range of products, which are adapted to its in-\ndividual market.\nThe Global versus Local Debate\nThere is an old axiom, “All business is local.” An extension of this saying is “Think globally, act\nlocally.” Although advertising campaigns can be created for a global market, they must be rele-\nvant to a transaction that is completed at or near home or in the office.\nAclassic article by Harvard Business School professor Theodore Levitt as long ago as 1983\nignited a debate over how to conduct global marketing. Levitt argued that companies should op-\nerate as if there were only one global market. He suggested that differences among nations and\ncultures were not diminishing and people throughout the world are motivated by the same desires\nand wants.19 Other scholars argued that Levitt misinterpreted the importance of cultural differ-\nences and cited the success of such brands as Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and McDonald’s in develop-\ning products and marketing for the various cultures they serve.20\nIn support of Levitt’s thinking, some researchers propose sets of what they call universal val-\nuesthat cross cultures. They include such values as these:\n1. Protecting the family 6. Justice\n2. Honesty 7. Freedom\n3. Health and fitness 8. Friendship\n4. Self-esteem 9. Knowledge\n5. Self-reliance 10.
