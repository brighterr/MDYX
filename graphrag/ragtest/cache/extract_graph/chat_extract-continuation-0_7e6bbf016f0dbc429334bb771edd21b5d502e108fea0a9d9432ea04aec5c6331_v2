The telecom industry\n(AT&T, Verizon, Sprint) was cri-\ntiqued by BIGresearch and a team of\nmedia researchers from Northwest-\nern University. Based on consumer\nresearch and a customized analytical\nmodel, the team was able to develop\nan idealized set of media alloca-\ntions. In comparison to actual ex-\npenditures, the team concluded that\nthe industry overspends on televi-\nsion at the expense of others, such as\nthe Internet, radio, magazines, and\noutdoor. In particular, the consumer-\nbased research determined an under-\nuse of the Internet based on amount\nof time, its ability to influence pur-\nchase, and its lower costs.5\nMedia choices are sometimes\ndesigned to deliver the strategy of\nusing one medium to deliver an au-\ndience to another medium or mar-\nketing communication tool. For\nexample, mass media have fre-\nquently been used to promote spe-\ncial events and sales promotions.\nThe emergence of the Internet has\nintensified what you might call a\ntwo-step media platform. Print and\nThis ad demonstrates the use of a creative print ad to drive traffic to a website.\nbroadcast, which are basically in-\nformative and awareness building\nmedia forms, are often used to drive traffic to a brand’s website, which is more interactive and\nexperiential. The Frontier “Web” ad is an example of this use.\nGeographical Strategies Another factor planners use in analyzing the target audience is geogra-\nphy. Are potential customers found all over the country, therefore calling for a national campaign,\nand does the client have the budget to afford such an extensive media plan? In most cases, the me-\ndia plan will identify special regions or DMAs to be emphasized with a heavy-up schedule,which\nmeans proportionately more of the budget is spent in those areas. The company’s sales coverage\narea (i.e., geography) is a major factor used to make this decision. There’s no sense advertising in\nareas where the product isn’t available. Most national or regional marketers divide their market ge-\nographically. The amount of sales produced in each geographic market will vary, and marketers try\nto match advertising investments with the amount of forecasted sales or the sales potential.\nTo determine which geographical areas have the highest (and lowest) rate of consumption\nfor a particular product category, marketers compute a category development index (CDI)for\neach market in which they are interested. Then they calculate a brand development index (BDI),\nwhich estimates the strength of their brand in the various geographical areas. If General Mills\nwere to bring out a new line of grits, for example, it wouldn’t advertise nationally because most\ngrits are consumed in the South.\n432 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA
