Professional ethics are often expressed in a code of standards that\nidentifies how professionals in the industry should respond when faced with ethical questions.\nTheAmericanAssociationofAdvertisingAgencies(AAAA)beginsits“StandardsofPractice”\nwiththeline:“Weholdthataresponsibilityofadvertisingagenciesistobeaconstructiveforce\ninbusiness.”Thecoreofthestatement,theCreativeCode,isreproducedinFigure3.1.\nIn the wake of highly public business scandals such as the collapse of Enron in 2001, many\nfirms are responding with their own codes of ethics. If this subject interests you, you can look up\nthese codes in a collection compiled by the Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions at\nthe Illinois Institute of Technology (http://ethics.iit.edu/codes/).\nInternational Standards and Codes\nStandards of professional behavior are not found only in the United States or other Western coun-\ntries. Singapore, for example, has an ad code specifically designed to prevent Western-influenced\nadvertising from impairing Asian family values. Malaysia’s requirement that all ads be produced\nin the country not only keeps that country’s advertising aligned with its own standards and cultural\nvalues, it also cuts back dramatically on the number of foreign ads seen by its public. Advertisers\nwho violate the ethical code of conduct in Brazil can be fined up to $500,000 or imprisoned for up\nto five years. This punishment would certainly prompt an advertiser to be careful.\nIn the Netherlands, industry members have encouraged the formation of an “ethical office”\nto oversee all agencies, advertisers, and media. That office is responsible for reviewing adver-\ntisements to ensure that they comply with the Dutch Advertising Code and general ethical prin-\nciples. In Swedish advertising agencies, an executive known as the “responsible editor” is trained\nand experienced in marketing law; that editor reviews all advertisements and promotional mate-\nrials to ensure that they are legally and ethically acceptable.\nEthical Decision-Making Tools\nCodes of ethics can be helpful to guide your actions. However, they are broad statements and do\nnot explain what you should do in every circumstance you encounter. Developing a strong per-\nsonal and professional sense of right and wrong is a prerequisite to being able to exercise re-\nsponsible judgment when you’re confronted with an ethical dilemma. We include some tools that\nyou might find helpful. The Practical Tips box lists some questions that might prompt clearer\nthinking about murky ethical problems.\n80 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nPRACTICAL TIPS\nAn Ethics Checklist for Marketing Communicators\n1. In terms of its social impact, does this advertise- • drive demand for unnecessary purchases?\nment . . . • prey on people’s fears unnecessarily?\n• violate public standards of good taste? • undercut people’s self-image and self-concept?\n• reinforce negative stereotypes? • make unsubstantiated claims?\n• damage people’s self-image and create 3. In terms of its tactics, does this advertisement . . .\ninsecurities? • use ideas, words, or images that are offensive\n• promote materialism? or insensitive?\n• create false wants and false hope? • use inappropriate stereotypes?\n• contribute to cultural pollution? • manipulate people’s emotions unnecessarily?\n• market dangerous products? • make false, deceptive, or misleading claims?\n2. In terms of its strategic decisions, does this adver- • use unfair comparisons?\ntisement . . . • create endorsements or demonstrations that\n• target vulnerable groups? exaggerate or lie?\n• harm children? • use unnecessary scare or shock tactics?\n• appeal to base motivations such as envy and • use puffery?\ngreed?\nOne model that might guide you is the TARES Test of Ethical Advertising.30The five-part\ntest defines action-guiding principles directed toward making ethical decisions in the realm of\nprofessional persuasion. The communication passes the test if it is truthful,authentic,respectful,\nequitable and socially (TARES) responsible. These specific questions can guide your thinking:\n1. Are the ad claims in the message Truthful? Are visual and verbal claims truthful?\nAre omissions deceptive?\n2. Is the claim an Authenticone? Is there a sincere need for the product? Are the reasons\ngiven for purchasing the product genuinely appealing?\n3. Does the ad treat the receiver with Respect? Does it include inaccurate stereotypes or de-\ngrading language?\n4. Is there Equitybetween the sender and the receiver? Would the receiver of the ad need to\nbe unusually well informed or brilliant to understand the ad? Is some hidden prejudice\nmasked within the ad?\n5. Is the ad Sociallyresponsible?\nThere are other models. Alternatively, you could use the Potter Box (see Figure 3.2), which asks\ncommunication decision makers to consider four aspects of the dilemma. They need to (1) identify\nand understand the facts,(2) outline the valuesinherent in the decision, (3) apply rele-\nvant philosophical principles, and (4) articulate the competing loyalties. Using this\nFacts Loyalties\nmodel assumes you have some understanding of philosophical principles. None of these\nValues Principles tools will give you a single, right answer. They will, however, help you examine the\nproblem from a number of angles and think systematically about the problem.\nFIGURE 3.2\nThe Potter Box WHY AND HOW IS ADVERTISING REGULATED?\nThe Potter Box is a tool that\nallows you to analyze an ethi-\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF ADVERTISING AGENCIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA) is an organization that provides a code of ethics for advertising agencies, emphasizing their responsibility to be a constructive force in business)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF ETHICS IN THE PROFESSIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions at the Illinois Institute of Technology compiles codes of ethics from various professions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SINGAPORE<|>GEO<|>Singapore has an advertising code designed to prevent Western-influenced advertising from impairing Asian family values)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALAYSIA<|>GEO<|>Malaysia requires all ads to be produced in the country to align with its standards and cultural values, reducing foreign ads)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAZIL<|>GEO<|>Brazil enforces strict penalties for advertisers who violate ethical codes, including fines and imprisonment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETHERLANDS<|>GEO<|>The Netherlands has an ethical office responsible for ensuring advertisements comply with the Dutch Advertising Code and ethical principles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWEDEN<|>GEO<|>Swedish advertising agencies employ a 'responsible editor' to review advertisements for legal and ethical compliance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POTTER BOX<|>EVENT<|>The Potter Box is a model used to analyze ethical dilemmas by considering facts, values, principles, and loyalties)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF ADVERTISING AGENCIES<|>CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF ETHICS IN THE PROFESSIONS<|>Both organizations are involved in promoting ethical standards in their respective fields<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SINGAPORE<|>MALAYSIA<|>Both countries have specific advertising codes to maintain cultural values and standards<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NETHERLANDS<|>SWEDEN<|>Both countries have systems in place to ensure advertisements meet ethical and legal standards<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
