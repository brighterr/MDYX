Aradio network\nis a group of local affiliates connected to one or more na-\ntional networks through telephone wires and satellites.\nThe five major radio networks are Westwood One, CBS,\nABC, Unistar, and Clear Channel. The largest network\nby far is Clear Channel, with more than 1,200 stations.\nSatellite transmission has produced important technolog-\nical improvements that also make it easier to distribute\nadvertising to these stations. Many advertisers view net-\nwork radio as a viable national advertising medium, es-\npecially for food and beverages, automobiles, and\nArbitron is one of several major audience-rating services in\nover-the-counter drugs.\nthe advertising industry.

Buying spot radio and coping with its nonstandardized rate structures can be cum-\nbersome, however.\n• Syndicated Radio AdvertisingThis is the original type of radio programming that plays on a\nlarge number of affiliated stations, such as the Paul Harvey show, which is broadcast on\nsome 1,200 stations. Program syndicationhas benefited network radio because it offers ad-\nvertisers a variety of high-quality, specialized, and usually original programs. Both networks\nand private firms offer syndication. Alocal talk show may become popular enough to be\n“taken into syndication.” Advertisers value syndicated programming because of the high\nlevel of loyalty of its audience.\nThe growth of network radio has contributed to an increase in syndicated radio, creating more ad-\nvertising opportunities for companies eager to reach new markets. In fact, syndication and net-\nwork radio have practically become interchangeable terms.\nUsing Radio Effectively We have seen that radio is highly targeted and that makes it a great tool\nfor reaching audiences through specialized programming, such as talk shows and musical inter-\nests. Radio advertising messages tend to have a higher level of acceptance than television because\nradio listeners are more loyal to their favorite programs and stations. The Radio Advertising\nCHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 373\nBureau (RAB) promotes radio as having a dynamic consumer engagement that can be measured\nusing audience metrics of reach, relevance, and receptivity.\nAlthough radio may not be a primary medium for most businesses, it does have excellent\nreminder and reinforcement capability and is great about building frequency through repeti-\ntion, particularly if the message can be delivered through a jingle. It also sparks the imagina-\ntion because of its ability to stimulate mental imagery through the theater of the mind, which\nuses humor, drama, music, and sound effects to tell a story. It also brings the persuasive power\nand warmth of a human voice. Agood example is the series of Tom Bodett’s Motel 6 commer-\ncials by the Dallas-based Richards Group. Listen to them at http://adland.tv/search/node/\nMotel%206.\nTo maximize the impact of a radio spot, timing is critical and depends on understanding the\ntarget audience’s aperture, which is particularly important in radio with its “drive-time” daypart.\nAperturemeans knowing when the target audience is most likely to be listening and responsive.\nRestaurants run spots before meals; auto dealerships run spots on Friday and Saturday, when\npeople are free to visit showrooms; and jewelry stores run spots before Christmas, Valentine’s\nDay, and Mother’s Day.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IO AWARD<|>EVENT<|>The IO Award is a recognition given for a long career in jingle writing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAND-AID<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Band-Aid is a brand known for its adhesive bandages, famous for its catchy jingle)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AD COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Ad Council is an organization that creates public service announcements and campaigns for good causes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WESTWOOD ONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Westwood One is one of the major radio networks in the United States)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CBS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CBS is a major American radio and television network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ABC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ABC is a major American broadcasting network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNISTAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unistar is one of the major radio networks in the United States)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLEAR CHANNEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Clear Channel is the largest radio network in the United States with more than 1,200 stations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARBITRON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Arbitron is a major audience-rating service in the advertising industry, estimating radio audience sizes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL HARVEY SHOW<|>EVENT<|>The Paul Harvey Show is a syndicated radio program broadcast on approximately 1,200 stations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICHARDS GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Richards Group is a Dallas-based advertising agency known for creating the Motel 6 commercials)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAND-AID<|>IO AWARD<|>The Band-Aid jingle is one of the well-known works of the jingle writer recognized by the IO Award<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AD COUNCIL<|>PSA<|>The Ad Council creates public service announcements (PSAs) for good causes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLEAR CHANNEL<|>WESTWOOD ONE<|>Both Clear Channel and Westwood One are major radio networks in the United States<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLEAR CHANNEL<|>CBS<|>Both Clear Channel and CBS are major radio networks in the United States<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLEAR CHANNEL<|>ABC<|>Both Clear Channel and ABC are major radio networks in the United States<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLEAR CHANNEL<|>UNISTAR<|>Both Clear Channel and Unistar are major radio networks in the United States<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL HARVEY SHOW<|>SYNDICATED RADIO<|>The Paul Harvey Show is an example of syndicated radio programming<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICHARDS GROUP<|>MOTEL 6<|>The Richards Group created the Motel 6 commercials<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
