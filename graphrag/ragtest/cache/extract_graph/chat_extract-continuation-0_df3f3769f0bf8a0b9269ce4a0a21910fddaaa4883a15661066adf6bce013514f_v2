Al-\nthough the campaign wasn’t presented as a weight-loss program, it generated a significant\namountofbuzzquestioningthestrategy.AccordingtoZetaBuzz,afirmthattrackspostingson\nblogs,messageboards,andsocialmedia,TacoBell’sbuzzratingdroppedsixpoints—thevolume\nof postings increased but the tone was much more negative, which indicated the strategy was\nbackfiring.17\nAnother interesting experiment was conducted by Boston University college students and\nthe Mullen ad agency using Twitter to get near-instantaneous feedback on how viewers were re-\nacting to Super Bowl ads. The project was designed “to use a new medium to comment on an old\nmedium,” according to Mullen’s chief creative officer.18\nROI and Media Efficiency\nAdvertisers continue to improve how they measure advertising ROI(return on investment, which\nmeans the costs of creating and running the advertisement versus the revenue it generates). An-\nother way to look at it is the cost-to-sales ratio.\nSince the dollar impact for advertising—and public relations, especially—is difficult to mea-\nsure, ROI is hard to calculate. The campaigns must be carefully designed not only to increase\nsales, but also to ensure that advertisers can isolate the impact of the message and verify that the\nadvertising caused the increase in sales. ROI is easier to calculate for direct marketing (because\nthere are fewer variables between the message and the sales) and for sales promotion (because\nthere is an immediate response, which is easier to link to the message).\nOne question related to ROI is this: How much spending is too much? That is, how do you\ndetermine whether you are overadvertising or underadvertising? That’s one of the key reasons to\nuse test marketing. If a campaign is launched in several different, but matched, cities at different\nlevels of media activity, a comparison of the campaign results (sales or other kinds of trackable\nresponses) can determine the appropriate level and type of media spending.\nWearout The point where the advertising, because it has been seen multiple times, no longer\nstimulates much of a response is called wearout. This is also the point where recall stabilizes or\ndeclines and irritation levels increase because people are tired of hearing or seeing the same ad.\nWearout is a combination of creative impact and media buying. The more intrusive or the\nless interesting the creative technique, the higher the level of irritation. It’s like a joke: you may\npay attention the first couple of times you hear it, but then it gets “old.” Other types of advertis-\ning are less prone to wearout. Good jingles, for example, can be repeated almost endlessly. The\nmore people like to hum along, the less likely there will be a wearout problem.\nThe issue is how long and how much is needed to create the necessary impact. John Philip\nJones, who has done extensive research into effectiveness issues, argues that research supports\nhigher continuity. He recommends spreading the budget out and adding weeks to the media\nschedule as much as possible.19Another way to evaluate such decisions is through media opti-\nmization models.\nMedia Optimization One of the biggest challenges in media planning is media efficiency—\ngettingthemostforthemoneyinvested.YoumayrememberfromChapter14thatmediaplan-\nners operate with computer models of media optimization—or the optimum media\nperformance—thatareusedinmakingdecisionsaboutmediaselection,scheduling,andweights\n(amountofbudget).Modelsarealwaystheoretical,sooneresultofpostevaluationisthattheac-\ntual performance of a plan can be compared with the results projected by the media planner’s\nmodel.Thegoalofmediaoptimizationistooptimizethebudget—togetthemostimpactpossi-\nblewiththeleastexpenditureofmoney.Thatisthecriticalfindingderivedfromthecomparison\nofperformancewithprojections.Inadditiontomeetingthereachandfrequencyobjectives,was\nthemediaplanefficient?\n594 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nAnew dimension to the efficiency question comes from a program by media company Star-\ncom to measure the effectiveness of various media used by client Applebee’s. The objective was\nto develop a model that compares the value of video ads, both on-air and online, across a number\nof NBC properties. The model will establish the relative value of the ads and also interaction\nacross channels.20\nEVALUATING IMC TOOLS, CAMPAIGNS, AND PROGRAMS\nEvaluation is the final and, in some respects, most important step in an advertising campaign be-\ncause it determines whether the campaign effort was effective. Acampaign evaluation will assess\nthe campaign’s performance in terms of its message and media objectives. It employs either in-\nternal performance data or results from an outside research organization that monitors brand per-\nformance, such as Gallup-Robinson, Decision Analyst Inc., and Millward Brown. The important\nthing to remember in planning an evaluation program is that evaluation has to be built into the\nmarketing communication plan from the very beginning.\nAn IMC campaign employs various marcom tools, such as sales promotion, public rela-\ntions, direct marketing, events and sponsorships, personal sales, packaging, point of purchase\n(PoP), and specialties. You’ll find that most of these areas have their own metrics by which per-\nformance is measured.\nEven though an IMC campaign is evaluated in terms of its\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TACO BELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Taco Bell is a fast-food chain that promoted its 'Fresco' menu through the 'Drive-Thru Diet' campaign, which generated significant buzz and controversy<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZETABUZZ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ZetaBuzz is a firm that tracks postings on blogs, message boards, and social media, and it reported on the buzz rating of Taco Bell's campaign<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOSTON UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Boston University is an educational institution where college students conducted an experiment using Twitter to get feedback on Super Bowl ads<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULLEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mullen is an ad agency that collaborated with Boston University students to use Twitter for real-time feedback on Super Bowl ads<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPER BOWL<|>EVENT<|>The Super Bowl is a major annual sporting event in the United States, known for its high-profile advertisements<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STARCOM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Starcom is a media company that developed a model to measure the effectiveness of various media used by client Applebee’s<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLEBEE'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Applebee's is a client of Starcom, involved in a program to measure the effectiveness of video ads across NBC properties<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TACO BELL<|>ZETABUZZ<|>ZetaBuzz tracked the buzz rating of Taco Bell's 'Drive-Thru Diet' campaign<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOSTON UNIVERSITY<|>MULLEN<|>Boston University students collaborated with Mullen to use Twitter for feedback on Super Bowl ads<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOSTON UNIVERSITY<|>SUPER BOWL<|>Boston University students conducted an experiment related to Super Bowl ads<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULLEN<|>SUPER BOWL<|>Mullen collaborated on a project to get feedback on Super Bowl ads<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STARCOM<|>APPLEBEE'S<|>Starcom developed a model to measure the effectiveness of media used by Applebee’s<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
