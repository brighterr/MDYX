The Internet is the ultimate convergence medium because it bridges print and broadcast\nmedia and blurs the distinction between them. Newspapers, magazines, and other print forms can\nbe delivered online, and their messages still look like print. Video is moving online and even on\nto cell phones. We’ve talked about convergence in previous chapters, but the Internet is driving\nthis trend by creating an increasingly wired and connected world.\nThe Budget Travel website (BudgetTravel.msnbc.com) is a partnership between Arthur\nPrinciple\nFrommer’s travel magazine and the MSNBC channel and it also offers a free e-mail newsletter.\nThe Internet is the ultimate\nIt’s an example of the convergence of print, television, and online media. It also invites interac- convergence medium\ntion by letting visitors search for the best travel deals and money-saving ideas. Do you think it because it bridges print\nwould be effective in driving travelers to the website? and broadcast media and\nThese new media forms not only provide access to information, but also encourage more in- blurs the distinction\nvolvement by users and sharing of experiences, both of which lead to more persuasive impact for between them.\nWeb-delivered messages. Before we talk about Internet marketing communication, let’s first re-\nview the basics of the Internet.\nInternet Basics\nTechnically, the Internet is a linked system of international computer networks. The World\nWideWebistheinformationinterfacethatallowspeopletoaccesstheInternetthroughaneasy-\nto-use graphical format. However, most people use these terms Internet and Web interchange-\nably.The thing to remember is that the Internet, which didn’t come into common use until the\n1990s,isstillevolvinganddrivenbyinnovation.Thenewapplicationsandtechnologiesarecre-\nating a dynamic environment that challenges old ways of doing business. The area seeing the\ngreatest change is media where traditional print and broadcast forms are reshaping themselves\nforanonlinepresence.\nThe Internet is an important marketing communication medium because it combines the\ncharacteristics of many other media—newspapers and newsletters, magazines, catalogs, directo-\nries, television, radio, phones, and film. It is useful for communicating brand information, but that\ncapability is a two-edged sword. Any major problem with a brand can be communicated around\nthe world instantly. Tiger Woods, one of the world’s greatest personal brands, found that out when\nhis minor car accident on the street outside his Florida home exploded into a blaze of global com-\nmunication filled with endless speculation and rumors about his life and loves.\nThe Internet plays a critical role in both consumer and business-to-business (B2B) customers’\nbrand decisions. Here are some of the reasons why it has become so important to consumers—as\nwell as the marketers who want to reach them—in such a short time:\n• InformationBecause of easy searching, Internet users have access to a wealth of informa-\ntion, not only about brands and companies, but also about trends, future developments, and\nproduct reviews.\n• ChoiceThe Internet offers more choices and consumers can easily do comparative shopping\nonline. That means they can learn more about brands, not only from a brand’s website but\nalso from third parties.\n• AccessibilityThemajorityofthepopulationhasaccesstocomputers,andindividualswho\ndonotcangoonlineatworkorpubliclocations,suchaslibraries,schools,andInternet\ncafes.\n• SpeedThe Internet has grown to be a medium with unsurpassed speed and widespread cov-\nerage. Especially with high-speed connection services, information travels across the Inter-\nnet almost instantaneously and is carried to almost all parts of the globe.\n392 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nOnline marketers value the Internet for the same reasons, however they also see benefits in\nsome basic business areas:\n• CapitalOpening a business online is far less costly than opening a traditional brick-and-\nmortar business.\n• Cost ReductionsSelling online and keeping track of customer relationship behavior with\nreal-time data is also less costly than operating a traditional brick-and-mortar business.\n• LocationThe Internet reaches beyond local markets, which is important for specialty goods.\nFor example, in Lincoln, NE, a business that specializes in selling licorice would find it hard\nto thrive if the owners relied solely on people from the area patronizing it. The Internet al-\nlows the market to live in the world, not just in a local location.\nAnumber of different “nets” are used in marketing communication beyond the basic Inter-\nnet. Because it is an interactive “web,” the Internet is a relatively inexpensive communication\nmedium that connects a company with all of its stakeholders—employees, investors, and other\ngroups that have a stake in the success of the brand. Companies set up intranetsfor internal com-\nmunication and extranetsto connect employees with key external stakeholders, such as market-\ning communication agencies, suppliers, and distributors.\nHere are some other important Internet terms and tools:\n• URLs and Domain NamesAwebsite has an address called a URL(Uniform Resource Lo-\ncator), which is its domain name,a global address that identifies a specific location in cy-\nberspace on the Web where a document or website lives.\n• PortalsAportalis a site that provides doors, or links, to other websites, such as AOLand\nMSN. Yahoo!, for example, is a directory\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITIZEN MARKETERS<|>EVENT<|>A book discussing the impact of consumer-generated content on corporate decision-making)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUDGET TRAVEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A travel website that is a partnership between Arthur Frommer's travel magazine and MSNBC, offering travel deals and a free e-mail newsletter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARTHUR FROMMER<|>PERSON<|>The founder of a travel magazine that partners with MSNBC for the Budget Travel website)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MSNBC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A news channel that partners with Arthur Frommer's travel magazine for the Budget Travel website)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIGER WOODS<|>PERSON<|>A globally recognized golfer whose personal brand was affected by a car accident incident)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINCOLN, NE<|>GEO<|>A location mentioned as an example of a local market that can benefit from the global reach of the Internet)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUDGET TRAVEL<|>ARTHUR FROMMER<|>Arthur Frommer's travel magazine is a partner in the Budget Travel website<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUDGET TRAVEL<|>MSNBC<|>MSNBC is a partner in the Budget Travel website<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIGER WOODS<|>INTERNET<|>Tiger Woods' car accident incident was widely communicated through the Internet<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINCOLN, NE<|>INTERNET<|>The Internet allows businesses in Lincoln, NE to reach a global market<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
