The problem: How can media\nchoices help meet the marketing and advertising objectives? The ultimate goal is to reach the tar-\nget audience with the right message in the best possible way at the best possible time in the most\nefficient way possible. In this chapter, we review how a media plan is developed—how media\nplanners set objectives and develop media strategies. We then explore the media-buying function\nand explain how media buyers execute the plan.\nHOW ARE MEDIA PLANS CREATED?\nMedia planners are in the connection business, as the Dove case illustrates. Their work connects\nbrand messages with customers and other stakeholders. They identify and activate the points of\ncontact where brand messages touch consumers. The Dove plans included traditional media, par-\nticularly print and outdoor, but also websites, Internet videos, viral marketing, a theatrical play,\nand party hosting. Note that this media plan involved a lot more than advertising, which supports\nthe point we made in Chapter 11that all forms of marketing communication use media.\nMaking connections that resonate with the audience is the hallmark of effective marketing\ncommunication, wherever that may occur. Think about the U.S. Army’s power to connect with\nrecruits using the video game–based experience and event you read about in Chapter 13, as well\nas the emotional connections created in the Dove “Real Women” and “ProAge” campaigns. An-\nother example features embedded ads in video games as described in The Inside Story feature.\nNot only was this an interesting ad placement, it also generated great publicity.\nWe mentioned in Chapter 11that traditionally, the advertising agency’s media department\nhas been responsible for developing the media plan with input from the agency’s account and cre-\native teams and the marketer’s brand management group. More recently, media-buying compa-\nnies have moved into the planning stage as well, bringing the expertise of their media researchers\nand negotiators. Some major agencies have spun off the media function as a separate company;\nthen they contract with that company for their media planning and buying services. Others have\nCHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 421\nTHE INSIDE STORY\nCampaign Ads in Video Games\nHolly Duncan Rockwood,Director of Corporate Communications, Electronic Arts\nIn the fall of 2008, President would build a marketing strategy that included adver-\nObama made advertising his- tising in video games.
