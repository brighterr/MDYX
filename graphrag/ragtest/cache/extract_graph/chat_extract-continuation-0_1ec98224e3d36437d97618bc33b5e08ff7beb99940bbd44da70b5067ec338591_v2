How do you convince more young guys who like Axe products to\nthrow away their bars of soap and start using Axe Shower Gel?\nA little background first. Unilever’s personal care brand Axe led the way in get-\nting young men to use scented body sprays. Launched in 2002 in the United States,\nAxe deodorant body sprays captured the attention of its audience and soon be-\ncame the top male deodorant brand in the country. (Did guys even know they\nneeded scented body sprays before then?)\nExpanding its line in men’s grooming products with the shower gel repre-\nsented a great opportunity for Unilever, who, along with its ad agency, Bartle Bogle\nHegarty, wanted to grab the attention of the 18- to 34-year-old male audience. It\nran the successful and award-winning “How Dirty Boys Get Clean” campaign,\nwhich you may have seen.\nAxe reached its core audience with that campaign by creating an emotional\napproach that worked particularly well in the broadcast media. The big idea be-\nhind the campaign was that Axe Shower Gel would do more than clean guys phys-\nically; it would help clean their spirits as well. The campaign’s creative work\ncommunicated the “dirty message.” The agency chose media to reach and capti-\nvate the audience, amplifying the message in situations where guys might be hav-\ning “dirty thoughts.”\nTo reach these guys, TV commercials ran on programs like Baywatch, The Real\nWorld,andAqua Teen Hunger Force.Print ads were placed in Maxim, Playboy,and\ntheSports Illustratedswimsuit issue. Axe also turned up at two of the largest spring\nbreak destinations for college guys where they encountered shower gel messages\neverywhere—on bar posters, hotel shower curtains, floor stickers, and bus wraps.\nThewww.theaxeeffect.comwebsite also entertained the guys.\nAfter that campaign had run its course, Axe realized it needed to figure out\nhow to get more of the target 18- to 34-year-old guys to switch from bars to\nshower gel. The “Aha!” moment for the next campaign emerged from research\n325\n326 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nthat indicated a correlation between using a loofah and satisfaction with shower\ngel’s cleansing power. Without a scrubber, they just weren’t using the shower gel,\nand although they said they used loofahs, shower ethnography (a bit tricky, don’t\nyou imagine?) showed that in reality, they were using fluffy, soft, girlie poufs. Not\nthe macho image you’d expect.\nThe key to this campaign was to create a new shower tool soft enough for\ntheguys’privatepartsandtoughenoughforthemtofeelcleanfortheirwomen.\nAxebrilliantlycreatedascrubberthatlookedlikeacartireanddrawingfromcar\nculture, gave it a cool, masculine name, the Detailer. Carrying the idea to the\nmax, the idea developed into a concept that appealed to the target audience:\nGuywash.\nTo demonstrate Guywash to the target audience, BBH used the storytelling\npower of cinema and TV. Furthermore, they capitalized on the interactivity of dig-\nital media to let guys try the Detailer. The “Dirty Night Determinator” on the web-\nsite prescribed a personalized scrub routine for whatever dirty situations the guys\nmight encounter. Girls could use Facebook to send a “gift” to “dirty” guys. Free\nDetailers were sent to anyone who requested one on the brand page. These me-\ndia were supported by local-area promotions, in-store Detailer “technicians” who\nguided them to the section of the store, and point-of-purchase efforts that turned\nshopping into an experience.\nYou will find more about the marketing effects of Axe’s shower gel campaign\nat the end of the chapter in the It’s a Wrapsection.\nSources:“Axe Detailer: The Manly Shower Tool,” Effie Awards Brief of Effectiveness, www.nyama.org;“How Dirty Boys\nGet Clean,” www.nyama.org;Michael Bush, “Unilever Wins Two Awards for Axe, Dove Media Campaigns,” April 20, 2009,\nwww.adage.com;“Mindshare Wins Bet Localisation at Valencia Festival of Media,” April 20, 2009, www.mindshareworld\n.com;www.theaxeeffect.com.\nThe lesson that the Axe campaign teaches about media is that smart marketing requires creative\nthinking about how to connect with the audience in this complex media environment.
