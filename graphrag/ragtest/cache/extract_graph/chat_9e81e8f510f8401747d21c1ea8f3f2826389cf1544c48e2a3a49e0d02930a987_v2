When Goodyear pur-\nchases the packaging materials used to ship the tires it manufactures, information needs fo-\ncus on prompt, predictable delivery.\n• GovernmentThe largest purchasers of industrial goods in the United States are federal,\nstate, and local governments. These government units purchase virtually every kind of good,\nfrom $15 hammers to multimillion-dollar missiles. Such goods may be advertised in\nCommerce Business DailyorDefense News. These purchases are usually made by bids and\ncontracts, and the decision is made on price and specifications.\n• Trade/Channel MarketingTrade advertisingis used to persuade distribution channel mem-\nbers, such as distributors, wholesalers, dealers, and retailers, to stock the manufacturer’s\nproducts.Chain Store Age,Florist’s Review, and Pizza and Pastaare examples of trade pub-\nlications, and there are thousands more covering every possible product category. Resellers\nwant information on the profit margins they can expect to receive, the product’s major sell-\ning points, and the producer’s plans for consumer advertising and other promotional support.\n• ProfessionalAdvertising directed at a group of mostly white-collar workers such as lawyers,\naccountants, technology consultants, doctors, teachers, funeral directors, and advertising and\nmarketing specialists is known as profession advertising.Advertisers interested in attract-\ning professionals advertise in publications such as the Music Educators’Journaland\nAdvertising Age.\n• AgriculturalAgricultural advertising promotes a variety of products and services, such as\nanimal health products, seeds, farm machinery and equipment, crop dusting, and fertilizer.\nLarge and small farmers alike want to know how industrial products can assist them in the\nproduction of agricultural commodities.\nThey turn to such publications as\nCalifornia FarmerandTrees and Turffor\nsuch assistance.\nCreating B2B Communication\nIn terms of objectives, B2B advertising is used\nCreate Awareness Inform about Product\nto create and maintain brand awareness and to\nsupport the personal selling function. As a result, Reputation, Connection\nB2B objectives center on creating company\nawareness, increasing overall selling efficiency,\nand generating leads (see Figure 18.3).

What exactly do you want the reader to do as a result of\nseeing your ad?\n• Provide contact information. It should be easy for the potential customer to follow through\nwith a response.\nB2B Media\nAlthough some business marketers use traditional consumer media, most rely on general business\nor trade publications, industrial directories, consumer media, websites, direct marketing, or some\ncombination of these media.\n• General Business and Trade PublicationsAs we saw in Chapter 12, business and trade\npublications are classified as either horizontal or vertical. Horizontal publicationsare di-\nrected to people who hold similar jobs in different companies across different industries. For\nexample,Purchasingis a specialized business publication targeted to people across indus-\ntries who are purchasing agents. In contrast, vertical publications,such as Iron Age and\nSteelorAdvertising Age, are targeted toward people who hold different positions in a partic-\nular industry.\n• Directory AdvertisingEvery state has an industrial directory, and there are also a number of\nprivate ones. One of the most popular industrial directories is the New York–based Thomas\nRegister. The 19-volume Registercontains 50,000 product headings and listings from\n123,000 industrial companies selling everything from heavy machine tools to copper tubing\nto orchestra pits.\n• Consumer MediaSometimes businesses advertise in consumer magazines, such as Golf,\nTime,orNewsweek,in the hope of building widespread brand recognition, such as the “Intel\nInside” campaign. There also has been some growth in business television programming,\nwhich provides a good message vehicle for certain B2B companies. For example, Financial\nNetwork News (FNN) produces its own business shows and carries the syndicated business\nshowsThis Morning’s BusinessandFirst Business.\n• The Internet and B2BThe Internet is a key medium for B2B advertisers. Company web-\nsites allow business clients to view product lists, place orders, check prices and availabil-\nity, and replace inventories automatically. The Internet is also a primary research tool used\nby B2B marketers to check out competitors and to find areas of new business and suppli-\ners. One of the most popular B2B sites on the Internet is the FedEx site, which allows\nclients to track packages, obtain price information, and learn about FedEx software\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
