If the marketing manager\npredictssalesof $6 million for next year, then the ad budget would be $1.2 million. How\ncan we calculate the percentage of sales and apply it to a budget? Follow these two steps:\nPast advertising dollars\nStep 1: (cid:4) % of sales\nPast sales\nStep 2: % of sales (cid:5)Next year’s sales forecast (cid:4)New advertising budget\n• Competitive BudgetsThis method uses competitors’budgets as benchmarks and relates the\namount invested in advertising to the product’s share of market. This suggests that the adver-\ntiser’s share-of-advertising voice—that is, the advertiser’s media presence—affects the share\nof attention the brand will receive, and that, in turn, affects the market share the brand can\nobtain. Here’s a depiction of these relationships:\nShare of Share of Market\n(cid:4) (cid:4)\nmedia voice consumer mind share\nKeep in mind that the relationships depicted here are only a guide for budgeting. The\nactual relationship between share-of-media voice(an indication of advertising expenditures)\nandshare of mindor share of market depends to a great extent on factors such as the cre-\nativity of the message and the amount of clutter in the marketplace.\n• All You Can AffordWhen a company allocates whatever is left over to advertising, it is using\nthe “all you can afford” budgeting method. It’s really not a method, but rather a philosophy\n210 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nabout advertising. Companies using this approach, such as high-tech start-ups driven by prod-\nuct innovation, don’t value advertising as a strategic imperative. For example, a company that\nallocates a large amount of its budget to research and has a superior product may find the\namount spent on advertising is less important.\nEvaluation: Determining Effectiveness Evaluation is an important part of an advertising plan\nbecause it is the process of determining the effectiveness of a campaign. Evaluation is impossi-\nble if the campaign has not established measurable objectives, so this part of the campaign plan\nspecifies how exactly those objectives will be measured. In effect, it is a research proposal. All of\nthese procedures and techniques for post-campaign evaluation will be discussed in more detail in\nChapter 19. Atool for setting these measurable objectives is account planning, which provides in-\nformation about what consumers think and feel in order to determine what the plan needs to do\nto have impact on the market.\nACCOUNT PLANNING: WHAT IS IT?\nAs Fallon and Senn outlined in one of their principles earlier in this chapter, the key to effective\nadvertising is a powerful consumer insight, a central emotional truth about a customer’s rela-\ntionship with a brand.\nWhen the Eight O’Clock coffee brand, for example, wanted to know more about its audi-\nence to better target its message, it used videotaped observational research to identify key insights\ninto how people relate to coffee. Rather than a rosy sunrise, the tapes showed that it was a strug-\ngle to get moving. “In real life,” the strategic planner concluded, “people stumble around, trying\nto get kids out of bed. Coffee is the fuel that gets them dressed, fed, and out the door.” On other\ntapes, it also showed that coffee was the reward for mom after the kids are out the door. “I have\nmy cup of coffee when the kids leave,” one mom observed. “It’s my first moment to take a\nbreather. And it gives me energy.”21\nAccount planning is the tool that analyzes the research to uncover these consumer insights.\nInsight—that’s what happens when the light bulb goes off and the planner sees something in a\nnew way. As in the Eight O’Clock coffee example, the planner struck gold by finding out that cof-\nfee is the fuel that gets adults, particularly moms, through the morning rush—and it’s also the re-\nward for surviving that busy routine. From this insight come clues about how and when to reach\nthe target audience and what to say to her. Here’s the planner’s mission:\n• Who?Who are you trying to reach and what insight do you have about how they think, feel,\nand act? How should they respond to your advertising message?\n• What?What do you say to them? What directions from the consumer research are useful to\nthe creative team?\n• Where?How and where will you reach them? What directions from the consumer research\nare useful to the media team?\nAccount planningis the research and analysis process used to gain knowledge of the con-\nsumer that is expressed as a key consumer insightabout how people relate to a brand or product.\nAnaccount planner,then, is a person in an agency who uses a disciplined system to research a\nbrand and its customer relationships to devise advertising (and other marketing communication)\nmessage strategies that are effective in addressing consumer needs and wants. Account planning\nagencies are based in research but focus on deriving meanings about consumers. Hall & Partners,\nfor example, has noted that with the new social media, the walls between private life and public\nlife have been breached. (Check the company out at www.hall-and-partners.com.) In case you’re\ninterested in account planning as a career, here is an actual job description for a vice president for\nglobal consumer insights for a major apparel company:\nThe role of the VP, Global Consumer Insights, is to create competitive advantage by deliv-\nering fact-based consumer/customer understanding and insights that facilitate speed and ac-\ncuracy of strategic and tactical decision\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EIGHT O'CLOCK COFFEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eight O'Clock Coffee is a brand that conducted research to understand consumer behavior and insights related to coffee consumption)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FALLON AND SENN<|>PERSON<|>Fallon and Senn are individuals who outlined principles related to effective advertising and consumer insights)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HALL & PARTNERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hall & Partners is a research-based agency focusing on consumer insights and the impact of social media on private and public life)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VP, GLOBAL CONSUMER INSIGHTS<|>PERSON<|>The Vice President for Global Consumer Insights is a role responsible for delivering consumer understanding and insights for strategic decision-making in a major apparel company)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EIGHT O'CLOCK COFFEE<|>FALLON AND SENN<|>Eight O'Clock Coffee's research aligns with the principles outlined by Fallon and Senn regarding consumer insights<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HALL & PARTNERS<|>VP, GLOBAL CONSUMER INSIGHTS<|>Hall & Partners' focus on consumer insights is relevant to the role of VP, Global Consumer Insights<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
