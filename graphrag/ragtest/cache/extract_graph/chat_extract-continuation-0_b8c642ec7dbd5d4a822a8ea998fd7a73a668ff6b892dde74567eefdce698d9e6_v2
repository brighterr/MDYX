One ad for Eagle Shirtmakers asked, “Is this your shirt?” Afollowing line said, “If so, Miss\nAfflerbach will send you your [Eagle logo picture] label.” The idea, which is explained in the\nbody copy, is that Eagle makes shirts for various shirtmakers, so you can contact “Miss Afflerbach”\nfor the official logo to add to your shirt.
