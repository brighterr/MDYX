Probably not many.\nDiets are kind of a girl thing. So you can imagine the job Coca-Cola had when\nit wanted to convince young men ages 18 to 34 to try its no-calorie Coke\nZero. The very dudes Coca-Cola wanted to appeal to said that diet sodas tasted\nbad and were far too feminine for them.\nAlthough Coke Zero had been around for three years and was gaining ac-\nceptance, Coca-Cola wanted to grow its share of market by adding the 18- to\n34-year-old male demographic. This wouldn’t be an easy sell. Enter Crispin Porter (cid:2)\nBogusky (CP(cid:2)B), an agency that has made its award-winning reputation on edgy\nwork that reaches the target market.\nCP(cid:2)B knew from Coca-Cola’s research that these guys liked the taste of reg-\nular sugary sodas, but as they aged they began to drink more lower calorie options\nlike energy drinks, water, or sports drinks and less pop. To accomplish the client’s\nthree main objectives—increase brand awareness, motivate the target audience to\ntry Coke Zero, and convince men 18–34 that Coke Zero tastes like Coke—CP(cid:2)B\nrelied on consumer research, which indicated that those who tried Coke Zero really\nthought it tasted like Coke.\nKnowing that young men had a negative perception of anything “diet,” CP(cid:2)B\nproposed to the client that the advertising should focus on the taste similarity of\nthe two products in a funny campaign that would appeal to the skeptical audience\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
