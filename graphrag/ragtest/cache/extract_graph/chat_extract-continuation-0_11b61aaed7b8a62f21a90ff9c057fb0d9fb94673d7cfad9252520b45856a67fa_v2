Pub-\nlic relations expert Fraser Seitel offers advice about the importance of\nmanaging corporate image in The Practice of Public Relations:\nMost organizations today understand that corporate image is a fragile\ncommodity, and to improve that image they must operate with the\n“implicit trust” of the public. That means that for a corporation in the\n21st century, winning favorable public opinion isn’t an option—it’s a\nnecessity, essential for continued long-term success.14\nSince corporate reputation is a perception, it is earned through\ndeeds, not created by advertising. Starbucks and Walmart offer examples\nof corporations working hard to create positive perceptions. Cause mar-\nketing, which we just mentioned, is one way corporations demonstrate\ntheir social responsibility.\nStarbucks is battling misperceptions that characterize it as a cor-\nporate giant with a media- and consumer-focused PR initiative called\n“Starbucks Shared Planet,” which you can read about on its website\n(www.starbucks.com). The program shows Starbucks’efforts in the areas\nof ethical sourcing, environmental stewardship, and community involve-\nment. Visitors to the interactive site are even offered the opportunity to\ncustomize their own global responsibility report.\nWalmart, one of the world’s biggest companies with more than $400\nbillion in annual sales, also faces the challenge of maintaining a positive\nimage. Walmart’s corporate website explains its efforts to be a good cor-\nporate citizen (go to www.walmart.com, then click on “Corporate Web-\nsite”). You can read about its commitments to the disaster relief efforts\nfor Haiti and Chile earthquake victims, to employing veterans, to build-\ning sustainability, and to improving health and wellness. One story de-\nscribes Walmart’s efforts to help educate American families about eating SHOWCASE\nhealthy foods. Reputation management is critically important to compa- Students in Boston University’s student-run\nagency, Adlab, created an online video aimed at\nnies that want to earn goodwill from their constituencies.\nrecruiting students to BU’s ROTC program.\nProfessors John Verret and Tobe Berkovitz\nCrisis Management There is no greater test for an organization than provided this work on behalf of their students,\nhow it deals with a crisis. The key to crisis managementis to anticipate who created this promotion in three days.\nthe possibility of a disaster and plan how to deal with the bad news and\nall the affected publics. Toyota’s recall of defective cars in 2010, cyanide-\nlaced Tylenol (a classic case from 1982), and the 2010 BPDeepwater Horizon oil disaster are all\nexamples of crises that public relations professionals would handle, or at least consult with the\ncorporations’top executives. Tiger Woods’admission of infidelity caused a crisis for the brands\nlike Gatorade, Gillette, and Accenture who’d hired him as a spokesperson.\nPreparingforapotentialcrisishelpsorganizationsweatherthestorm.Byanalyzingthepo-\ntentialforemergingcrisesandidentifyingresourcestocopewiththem,anorganizationcanbe\nreadytorespondquicklyandmeaningfully.15Effectivecrisisplanscanhelptobothavoidcrises\nand ease the damage if one occurs.Aplan outlines who contacts the various stakeholders who\nmight be affected (employees, customers, suppliers, civic and community leaders, government\nagencies),whospeakstothenewsmedia,andwhosetsupandrunsanon-sitedisaster-management\n466 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\ncenter.Companiesalsoshouldconductunannouncedcrisistrainingduringwhichstaffmustdrop\neverythinganddealwithasimulatedcrisisasitunfolds.Oneexampleofcrisispreparationisa\ncontingencyplantoeducateconsumersandreassurethemthatit’ssafetoeatporkshouldfearsof\ntheswineflupandemicrise.\nPublic Communication Campaigns Used as a way to change public opinion, public communi-\ncation campaignsalso discourage socially harmful behaviors, such as driving in areas with high\nlevels of air pollution. Sometimes they are engaged in counter marketing as they try to argue\nagainst other advertising messages. For example, the Florida truth®campaign by the Porter Nov-\nelli agency was designed to counter big tobacco companies’advertising that appeals to teenagers.\nThe strategy was to get young people to rebel against the tobacco industry. An extension of that\ncampaign by Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky featured teens in one award-winning commercial piling\nbody bags outside Phillip Morris’s New York headquarters. The campaign produced the largest\nsingle-year decline in teen smoking in nearly 20 years.\nTaken to the global level, public diplomacy is public relations writ large. President Obama\nand Secretary of State Hillary Clinton manifest efforts to promote the United States’interests in-\nternationally. You can read about a public communication campaign to change public opinion\nabout the war in Iraq in the A Matter of Principlebox.\nMarketing Public Relations One area where advertising and public relations overlap is\nmarketing public relations (MPR).Tom Harris, author of The Marketer’s Guide to Public Re-\nlations,says MPR is the fastest growing area of public relations. He defines MPR as the process\nof planning and delivering programs that encourage sales and contribute to customer satisfaction\nby providing communication that addresses the needs and wants of consumers.\nMPR is different from a more general public relations approach in its consumer, brand, and\nsales focus. However, the need to establish a credibility platform is similar in both;\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FRASER SEITEL<|>PERSON<|>Fraser Seitel is a public relations expert who offers advice on managing corporate image in his work, The Practice of Public Relations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STARBUCKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Starbucks is a corporation working to improve its image through initiatives like Starbucks Shared Planet, focusing on ethical sourcing, environmental stewardship, and community involvement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALMART<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Walmart is one of the world's largest companies, with efforts in disaster relief, veteran employment, sustainability, and health and wellness)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOSTON UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Boston University is an educational institution where students created a video for the ROTC program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOYOTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Toyota faced a crisis with the recall of defective cars in 2010)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BP was involved in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil disaster, a significant crisis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIGER WOODS<|>PERSON<|>Tiger Woods is a professional golfer whose admission of infidelity caused a crisis for brands he represented)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GATORADE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gatorade is a brand that faced a crisis due to its association with Tiger Woods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GILLETTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gillette is a brand that faced a crisis due to its association with Tiger Woods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACCENTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Accenture is a brand that faced a crisis due to its association with Tiger Woods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PORTER NOVELLI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Porter Novelli is an agency that designed the Florida truth® campaign to counter tobacco advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRISPIN PORTER + BOGUSKY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crispin Porter + Bogusky is an agency that extended the Florida truth® campaign with impactful commercials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHILLIP MORRIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Phillip Morris is a tobacco company targeted by the Florida truth® campaign)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRESIDENT OBAMA<|>PERSON<|>President Obama was involved in public diplomacy efforts to promote U.S. interests internationally)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HILLARY CLINTON<|>PERSON<|>Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was involved in public diplomacy efforts to promote U.S. interests internationally)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOM HARRIS<|>PERSON<|>Tom Harris is the author of The Marketer’s Guide to Public Relations, defining marketing public relations)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STARBUCKS<|>FRASER SEITEL<|>Starbucks' efforts in corporate image management align with Fraser Seitel's advice on reputation management<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WALMART<|>FRASER SEITEL<|>Walmart's efforts in corporate image management align with Fraser Seitel's advice on reputation management<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOYOTA<|>CRISIS MANAGEMENT<|>Toyota's recall of defective cars in 2010 is an example of a crisis that required management<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BP<|>CRISIS MANAGEMENT<|>BP's Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in 2010 is an example of a crisis that required management<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIGER WOODS<|>GATORADE<|>Tiger Woods' infidelity caused a crisis for Gatorade, a brand he represented<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIGER WOODS<|>GILLETTE<|>Tiger Woods' infidelity caused a crisis for Gillette, a brand he represented<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIGER WOODS<|>ACCENTURE<|>Tiger Woods' infidelity caused a crisis for Accenture, a brand he represented<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PORTER NOVELLI<|>PHILLIP MORRIS<|>Porter Novelli's Florida truth® campaign targeted Phillip Morris<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRISPIN PORTER + BOGUSKY<|>PHILLIP MORRIS<|>Crispin Porter + Bogusky's extension of the Florida truth® campaign targeted Phillip Morris<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRESIDENT OBAMA<|>HILLARY CLINTON<|>President Obama and Hillary Clinton worked together on public diplomacy efforts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOM HARRIS<|>MARKETING PUBLIC RELATIONS<|>Tom Harris defines and discusses the importance of marketing public relations<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
