Circulation is the primary way newspapers’reach is measured and compared\nwith the reach of other media. USA Today’scirculation is different from other daily newspapers\nin that it is targeted to travelers and its primary sales consist of single-copy sales and bulk sales\nto hotels, rather than subscriptions. Subscriptions, however, have been a problem as readers have\nmigrated to online versions and dropped their print subscriptions.\nNewspapers are chasing revenue in a number of new areas, in addition to online sales. The\nNew York Times, for example, sells a variety of classy items in its New York Timesstore. The mer-\nchandise is similar to that found in museum stores, such as art glass, music boxes, and old ship\nmodels. It has also started the New York TimesKnowledge Network and offers a variety of online\ncourses for personal and career development.\nAmore serious change was announced by the Dallas Morning News(DMN). The changes\nrevolved around a reorganization that would see section editors (sports, entertainment, real estate,\nautomotive, travel, among others) reporting to sales mangers. Die-hard journalists were horrified\nat the thought of the editorial side being merged with advertising because of implications for news\nobjectivity and independence. The DMNexecutives, however saw it as a way to grow the busi-\nness by better meeting advertisers’business development needs.2\nNewspaper Ad Sales Mirroring the circulation patterns, newspaper advertising can be de-\nscribed as national or local (retail), as well as classified and online. Newspaper advertising is sold\nbased on the size of the ad space and the newspaper’s circulation. The charges are published on\narate card,which is a list of the costs for advertising space and the discounts given to local ad-\nvertisers and advertisers who make volume buys. National advertisers pay a higher rate.\nMost advertising sales are handled locally by the sales staff of the newspaper; however,\nnewspaper representatives (called “reps”) sell space for many different newspapers. This saves\nan advertiser or its agency from the need to make a multitude of buys to run a national or regional\ncampaign in newspapers. The system is known as one-order, one-bill.The Newspaper National\nNetwork (www.nnnlp.com) is a partnership of newspaper companies that place ads in some\n9,000newspapers. Google has also gotten into this business, allowing advertisers to buy ads in\ndaily newspapers through its website.\nUntil the 1980s national advertisers shied away from using newspapers, not only because of\nthe buying problem, but also because each paper had its own peculiar size guidelines for ads,\nmaking it difficult to prepare one ad that would fit every newspaper. In the early 1980s, the Amer-\nican Newspaper Publishers Association and the Newspaper Advertising Bureau introduced the\nstandard advertising unit (SAU)system to solve this problem. The latest version of the SAU\nmakes it possible for newspapers to offer advertisers a great deal of choice within a standard for-\nmat. An advertiser can select one of the 56 standard ad sizes and be assured that its ad will work\nin every newspaper in the country.\nAnother alternative that allows national advertisers to pay the local rate is cooperative (co-\nop) advertising with a local retailer. Co-op advertisingis an arrangement between the advertiser\nand the retailer whereby the retailer buys the ad and the manufacturer pays half—or a portion de-\npending on the amount of space the manufacturer’s brand occupies.\nTypes of Newspaper Advertising Three types of advertising are found within the local newspa-\nper: retail/display, classified, and supplements—and most of these are found online, as well as in\nthe print form of the newspaper.\n• DisplayThe dominant form of newspaper advertising is display advertising.Display ads,\nsuch as the Aflac ads, can be any size and can be placed anywhere in the newspaper except\nCHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 357\nThese are examples of\nthe editorial page. The Wall Street Journalmade headlines in late 2006 when it announced it business-to-business\nwould add a “jewel-box” ad space to the lower right corner of its front page (think an ad the newspaper display ads\nsize of a CD case). Display ads can even be found in the classified section. Display advertis- for Aflac that ran in the\nWall Street Journal.\ning is further divided into two subcategories: local (retail)andnational (brand). Advertisers\nThey address business\nwho don’t care where their display ads run in the newspaper pay the run-of-paper (ROP)\nmanagers with a\nrate. If they want more choice over the placement, they can pay the preferred-position rate,\nmessage about making\nwhich lets them select sections in which the ad will appear.\nthe supplemental\n• ClassifiedTwo types of classified advertisinginclude advertising by individuals to sell their\ninsurance available to\npersonal goods and advertising by local businesses. These ads are arranged according to their employees.\ntheir interest to readers, such as “Help Wanted” and “Real Estate for Sale.” Classified ads\nhave represented approximately 40 percent of total newspaper advertising revenue in the\npast, but local online services, such as Craigslist, have almost destroyed newspaper classi-\nfied advertising. That has created a huge bottom-line problem for local newspapers.\n• SupplementsNewspapersupplementsare magazine-style publications inserted into a news-\npaper, especially in the Sunday edition, that are either syndicated nationally or prepared\nlocally. Syndicated supplements, such as ParadeandUSA Weekend,are provided by an inde-\npendent publisher that sells its publications to newspapers throughout the country.
