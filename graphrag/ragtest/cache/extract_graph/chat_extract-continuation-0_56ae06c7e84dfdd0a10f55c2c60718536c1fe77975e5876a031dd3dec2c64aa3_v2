Some agencies rent a\nsuite in a hotel and send the creative team there to get away and\nimmerse themselves in the problem. When the GSDM agency\nwas defending its prized Southwest Airlines account, the presi-\ndent ordered a 28-day “war room/death march” that had staffers\nworking around the clock, wearing Rambo-style camouflage,\nand piling all their trash inside the building to keep any out-\nsiders from rummaging around for clues to their pitch.\nThe following list builds on our previous discussion of cre-\native thinking. It can also be used as an outline for a brain-\nCarlsberg Sport Drink used a number of creative storming session.\ntechniques in this commercial including the unexpected\n(squirrel playing soccer after sipping the drink) and To create an original and unexpected idea,use the follow-\nexaggeration. ing techniques:\n• What if?To twist the commonplace, ask a crazy what if\nquestion. For example, what if wild animals could talk?\nThat question is the origin of Frontier’s talking animals\ncampaign.\n• An Unexpected AssociationInfree associationyou think of a word and then describe\neverything that comes into your mind when you imagine that word. If you follow a chain of\nassociations, you may come up with an idea that sets up an unexpected juxtaposition with\nthe original word or concept. An ad for Compaq used a visual of a chained butterfly to\nillustrate the lack of freedom in competitors’computer workstations.\n• Dramatize the ObviousSometimes the most creative idea is also the most obvious. That’s\ntrue for the Voodoo Doughnuts campaign. One of our Showcase contributors, Karl\nSchroeder, explained that the idea of magical power residing in a doughnut is new, but the\nblack magic idea comes directly from the name of the product.\n• Catchy PhrasingIsuzu used “The 205 Horsepower Primal Scream” for its Rodeo\nheadline.\nCHAPTER 8 • THE CREATIVE SIDE 251\n• AnUnexpectedTwistAnadforAmazon.comusedtheheadline“460booksforMarxists.In-\ncluding33onGroucho.”Aroadcrewusuallyreferstohighwayconstructionworkersorthe\nbehind-the-scenespeopleonaconcerttour,butfortheRoadCrewcampaign,thephrasewas\ntwistedtorefertolimodriverswhogiveridestopeoplewhohavehadtoomuchtodrink.\n• Play on WordsUnder the headline “Happy Camper,” an ad for cheese showed a picture of a\npacked sports utility vehicle with a huge wedge of cheese lashed to the rooftop.\n• Analogy and MetaphorUsed to see new patterns or relationships, metaphors, and analogies\nthat by definition set up juxtapositions. Harley-Davidson compared the legendary sound of\nits motorcycles to the taste of a thick, juicy steak.\n• Familiar and StrangePut the familiar in an unexpected situation: UPS showed a tiny model\nof its familiar brown truck moving through a computer cord.\n• A Twisted ClichéThey may have been great ideas the first time they were used, but phrases\nsuch as “the road to success” or “the fast track” become trite when overused. But they can\nregain their power if twisted into a new context. The “Happy Camper” line was twisted by\nrelating cheese to an SUV.\n• Twist the ObviousAvoid the predictable, such as a picture of a Cadillac on Wall Street or in\nfront of a mansion. Instead, use an SUVon Wall Street (“fast tracker”) or a basketball hoop in\nfront of a mansion (“slam dunk”).\n• ExaggerationTake a common situation or item and exaggerate it until it becomes funny (an un-\nbreakable kiss with the lovers totally unresponsive to over-the-top attempts to break them apart).\nTo prevent unoriginal ideas,avoid or work around the following:\n• The Look-AlikeAvoid copycat advertising that uses somebody else’s great idea. Hundreds\nof ads for escape products (resorts, travel, liquor, foods) have used the headline “Paradise\nFound.” It’s a play on “paradise lost” but still overused.\n• The TastelessIn an attempt to be cute, a Subaru ad used the headline, “Put it where the sun\ndon’t shine.” An attempted twist on a cliché, but it doesn’t work.\nGetting the Big Idea for marketing communication campaigns has always been the province\nof creative teams in agencies. Recently, however, with the development of new crowdsourcing\npractices, marketers are finding ways to enlist the collective ideas of thousands to come up with\ngreat ideas. Doritos has held “Crash the Super Bowl” competitions that invite consumers to cre-\nate ads to run during the Super Bowl.\nMANAGING CREATIVE STRATEGIES\nWe’ve talked about creative strategy and how it is developed, along with the types of effects ad-\nvertising creates and the message strategies that deliver on these objectives. Let’s now look at\nmanagement issues that affect the formulation of creative strategies and campaigns: extension,\nadaptation, and evaluation.\nExtension: An Idea with Legs\nOne characteristic of a Big Idea is that it gives legsto a campaign. By that we mean that the idea\nis strong enough to serve as an umbrella concept for a variety of executions in different media\ntalking to different audiences. It can be endlessly extended.\nExtendability is a strength of Frontier’s talking animals campaign as well.
