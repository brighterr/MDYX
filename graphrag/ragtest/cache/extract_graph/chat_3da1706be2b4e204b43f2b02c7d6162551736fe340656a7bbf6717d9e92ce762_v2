This percentage of the population who are\nbinge drinkers increases every year until it peaks with 50% of 21-year-olds being binge\ndrinkers.\nIt almost seems silly to ask in a college textbook why college students drink. You know\nthe answer. It can be fun. The CORE study showed that 74% say it gives them something\nto do, 62% say it allows you to have more fun, and 58% of males and 48% of females say\nconsuming alcohol facilitates bonding.\nTHE PROBLEM\nHow do we curb an activity (binge drinking) that is associated with more positive experi-\nences than negative experiences for students? We had to start with obvious solutions.\nTougher enforcement! But how? Police can’t be everywhere all the time. Bar raids and\nchecking IDs in liquor stores can only go so far toward curbing accessibility to alcohol.\nIt’s simply not practical to think we can stop underage binge drinking this way. The laws\nare already in place and enforced, and the problem is still with us. We can’t solve the\nproblem legally.\nJust say no. Students hate authorities telling them what to do and not do. At the very time\nthey are experiencing their first taste of independence, well-meaning groups that try to\ntell them not to drink, smoke, eat transfats, or whatever are unwelcome voices and aren’t\neffective. If that type of message worked, the problem would have been solved decades\nago. The authoritarian approach to stopping binge drinking simply does not work.\nInform them of the consequences. Everyone reading this knows there are serious poten-\ntial consequences associated with the overconsumption of alcohol. However, we also all\nbelieve we are invincible. Bad things happen to other people. Telling people what they\nalready know but don’t believe doesn’t work.\nTurn off the culture. Movies, TV, YouTube videos, thousands of websites, fraternities,\nsororities, beer and liquor companies with multimillion-dollar advertising budgets all\ntell us constantly that drinking with friends is fun; in fact, it is often portrayed as hilari-\nous. You can’t turn off the culture, and you can’t be dishonest.\nWe knew what wasn’t working; we didn’t know what would work. So we started look-\ning around the world of public service advertising at case studies and award-winning work\nand interviewed experts from other industries. Well-meaning failed communications cam-\npaigns outnumber successful case studies in this area by at least ten to one. However, no\nother attempt rang as true and had the business results to prove its success as much as the\ntruth® campaign for the American Legacy Foundation created by Arnold Worldwide and\nCrispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky. Clearly, there is a difference between stopping cigarette smok-\ning among teens and curbing binge drinking on college campuses, but there was a lot we\ncould learn here. Our biggest lesson was we had to identify a “bad guy.” One of the bril-\nliant ideas behind the truth campaign is that it didn’t attempt to blame you, the user. It\nblamed the tobacco company instead. We had a similar situation. Drinking isn’t bad; out-\nof-control binge drinking is.\nAPPENDIX 607\nResearch: What We Learned about Drinking—Yours and Our Own\nSo how do we curb binge drinking on college campuses? It took the AAF NSAC team from\nSyracuse University 1,556 in-depth surveys, 75 expert interviews, 15 observational ethnog-\nraphies, a deprivation study, and a review of journal articles to discover one very simple\nobservation:\nFreshmen drink very differently than seniors.\nFreshmen tend to get together, drink a lot fast to get as drunk as possible, and be social\naround people they don’t yet know. Seniors get together with friends they value and share\na few drinks to enjoy those times more. That’s a huge piece of information.\nThink about this: When you were a freshmen, chances are you “learned” to drink with\nother freshmen who also didn’t really know how to drink. No wonder we drink too much\ntoo fast. Over four years of college we actually “learn” to drink.\nThen it occurred to us . . . what if we could shorten the learning process?What if we\ncould take the four years of “learning to drink” and shorten that into three to six months?\nWould that curb binge drinking? We weren’t sure. So, we went to bars and frat houses to\nobserve binge drinkers in their environment. We observed them before they drank, while\nthey drank, and even the morning after they drank. We talked to students about binge drink-\ning and found out that nearly no one thinks of himself or herself as a “binge drinker.” To\nthe students, the term “binge” implies people that aren’t capable of limiting their con-\nsumption of alcohol. These students aren’t alcoholics; they’re just partying and having a\ngreat time. Sure it gets out of control once in a while, but they definitely don’t see that as a\n“problem.”\nSo we changed the words we used. Instead of talking about “binge” drinking, we\ntalked about “drinking too much.” Just changing the terminology we used caused a radical\nchange in the responses we received. Students know what drinking too much is. Most had\nexperienced it firsthand; all had seen it for themselves.\nThere is a line between “drinking” (which can be a lot of fun) and “drinking too much”\n(which can lead to unwelcome consequences).\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
