Excellent photo-\ngraphic and color reproduction is the big difference between newspapers and\nmagazines. Magazine advertisements are also able to take advantage of more\ncreative, attention-getting devices such as pop-up visuals, scent strips, and\ncomputer chips that play melodies when the pages are opened. An Altoids ad\nthat launched Altoids chewing gum, for example, ran in magazines with a novel\nprint production technique. It showed a box of Altoids chewing gum on one\npage, and a singed logo burnt onto the cartoon on the opposite page.\nThe key to an effective poster or outdoor board is a dominant visual with\nminimal copy. Because billboards must make a quick and lasting impression\nfrom far away, their layout should be compact with a simple visual path. The\nInstitute for Outdoor Advertising (IOA) recommends these tips for designers:\n• GraphicsMake the illustration an eye-stopper.\n• SizeImages in billboards are huge—a 25-foot-long pencil or a 43-foot\npointing finger. The product or the brand label can be hundreds of times\nHigh-contrast graphics are the key to\nlarger than life. good reproduction in a newspaper. The\n• ColorsUse bold, bright colors. The greatest impact is created by maximum art in these ads simulates an old wood\ncontrast between two colors such as dark colors against white or yellow.6 engraving.\n306 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\n• Figure/GroundMake the relationship between foreground and background as obvious as\npossible. Apicture of a soft drink against a jungle background is hard to perceive when\nviewed from a moving vehicle at a distance. The background should never compete with the\nsubject.\n• TypographyUse simple, clean, uncluttered type that is easy to read at a distance by an audi-\nence in motion. The industry’s legibility research recommends avoiding all-capital letters,\nfanciful ornamental letters, and script and cursive fonts.\n• Product IdentificationFocus attention on the product by reproducing the label or package at\na huge size.\n• ExtensionsExtend the frame of the billboard to expand the scale and break away from the\nlimits of the long rectangle.\n• ShapeFor visual impact, create the illusion of three-dimensional effects by playing with\nhorizons, vanishing lines, and dimensional boxes. Inflatables create a better 3-D effect than\nmost billboards can, even with superior graphics. Made of a heavyweight, stitched nylon, in-\nflatables can be freestanding, or they can be added to outdoor boards as an extension.\n• MotionAdd motors to boards to make pieces and parts move. Disk-like wheels and glittery\nthings that flicker in the wind create the appearance of motion, color change, and images\nthat squeeze, wave, or pour. Use revolving panels, called kinetic boards, for messages that\nchange.\nPrint Art Reproduction\nIn general, there are two types of printed images: line art and halftones. Adrawing or illustration\nis called line artbecause the image is solid lines on a white page, as in the Oklahoma City ads.\nPhotographs, which are referred to as continuous tonesorhalftones,are much more complicated\nto reproduce because they have a range of gray tones between the black and white, as shown in\nFigure 10.3.\nFIGURE 10.3\nLine Art and Halftone Art\nAn example of a figure reproduced as line art (left) and as a halftone (right).\nCHAPTER 10 • VISUAL COMMUNICATION 307\n10% 50% 100% FIGURE 10.4\nScreen Values and Tint\nBlocks\nThis shows the range of tint\nvalues that can be produced\nby different screens that rep-\nresent a percentage of the\ncolor value.\nPrinters create the illusion of shades of gray in converting photos to halftones by shooting\nthe original photograph through a fine screen,which converts the image to a pattern of dots that\ngives the illusion of shades of gray—dark areas are large dots that fill the screen and light areas\nare tiny dots surrounded by white space.The quality of the image depends on how fine the screen\nis: Newspapers use a coarse screen, usually 65 lines per inch (called a 65-line screen), whereas\nmagazines use fine screens, which may be from 120 up to 200 or 300 lines per inch.\nScreens are also used to create tint blocks,which can either be shades of gray in black-and-\nwhite printing or shades of color. Ablock of color can be printed solid or it can be screened black\nto create a shade. These shades are expressed as a range of percentages, from 100 percent (solid)\ndown to 10 percent (very faint). Figure 10.4gives examples of screens in color.\nColor Reproduction It would be impossible to set up a printing press with a separate ink roller\nfor every hue and value in a color photo. How, then, are these colors reproduced?\nFull-color images are reproduced using four distinctive shades of ink called process colors,\nin order to produce four-color printing.These colors are magenta (a shade of pinkish purple),\ncyan(a shade of bright blue), yellow, and black. Printing inks are transparent\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OKLAHOMA CITY<|>GEO<|>Oklahoma City is referenced in the context of ads designed for high-contrast, black-and-white printing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALTOIDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Altoids is a brand that launched a chewing gum product using a novel print production technique in magazines)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUTE FOR OUTDOOR ADVERTISING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Institute for Outdoor Advertising provides recommendations for designers on creating effective outdoor advertising)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALTOIDS<|>OKLAHOMA CITY<|>Altoids used a novel print production technique similar to the high-contrast style used in Oklahoma City ads<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTITUTE FOR OUTDOOR ADVERTISING<|>ALTOIDS<|>The Institute for Outdoor Advertising provides guidelines that could be applied to Altoids' advertising strategies<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
