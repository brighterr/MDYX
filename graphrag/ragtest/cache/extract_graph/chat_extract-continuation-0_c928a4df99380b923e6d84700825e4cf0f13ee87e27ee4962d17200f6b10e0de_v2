Is it providing information about milk? Is\nit trying to connect with you on an emotional level through fear, love, envy, hunger, or some other\nfeeling? Is it trying to get you to run down to the store and load up on milk? The real objective of\nthese ads is to change your attitude toward milk. It aims to convince you that milk isn’t just for\nkids and that attractive, interesting adults drink it, too.\nPersuasionis the conscious intent on the part of the source to influenceor motivate the re-\nceiver of a message to believe or do something. Persuasive communication—creating or chang-\ning attitudes and creating conviction—are important goals of most marketing communication. An\nattitudeis a state of mind—a tendency, inclination, or mental readiness to react to a situation in\na given way. Since advertising rarely delivers immediate action, surrogateeffects, such as chang-\ning an attitude that leads to a behavior, are often the goal of advertising. Attitudes are the most\ncentral factors in persuasion.\nAttitudes can be positive, negative, or neutral. Both positive and negative attitudes, particu-\nlarly those embedded in strong emotions, can motivate people to action—or away from action. A\nnegative attitude toward smoking, for example, may keep teenagers from trying cigarettes, and\ncreating that negative attitude was the objective of the truth®campaign discussed in Chapter 1.\nWhen people are convinced of something, their attitudes are expressed as beliefs.Sometimes\nattitude strategies attempt to extinguish beliefs—for example, that getting drunk is a badge of\nmasculinity, overeating is acceptable, or racist and sexist comments are funny. Attitude change\nstrategies often use the tools of logic and reasoning, along with arguments and counterarguments,\nto intensify the feelings on which beliefs are built.\nPersuasion, in other words, is an area where cognitive and affective factors are interrelated—\nPrinciple\npersuasion works both through rational arguments and by touching emotions in such a way that\nAdvertising employs both\nrational arguments and they create a compulsion to act. Persuasive strategies can be used to touch both the head and the\ncompelling emotions to heart.
