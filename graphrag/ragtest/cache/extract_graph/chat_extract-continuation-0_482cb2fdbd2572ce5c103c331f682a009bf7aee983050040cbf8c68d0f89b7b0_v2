In most coun-\ntries markets are composed of local, regional, international, and global brands. Alocal brandis\none marketed in a single country. Aregional brandis one marketed throughout a region (for ex-\nample, North America, Europe, China, India). An international brandis available in a number\nof different countries in various parts of the world. Aglobal brandis available virtually every-\nwhere in the world, such as Coca-Cola.\nMarketing programs that manage and promote the same brand in several countries or glob-\nally are practicing international marketing.International marketing communication did not ap-\npear in any organized manner until the 20th century.\nInternational marketing and marketing communication are not the exclusive province of\nlarge companies.

With only eight full-time employees, its products serve a high-end in-\nternational market. Most of Bu Jin’s business is driven by its catalog. (Check it out at\nwww.bujindesign.com.) Service providers also market internationally. Airlines and transporta-\ntion companies that serve foreign markets, such as United and UPS, are, in effect, exporting a\nservice.\nRegardless of the company’s form or style of management, the shift from national to inter-\nnational management requires new tools for marketers, including one language (often English),\none control mechanism (the budget), and one strategic plan (the brand strategy).\nThechoiceofanagencyoragenciesforinternationalmarketingdepends,inpart,onwhether\nthe brand’s messages are standardized across all markets or localized to accommodate cultural\ndifferences.Ifthecompanywantstotakeahighlystandardizedapproachininternationalmarkets,\nitislikelytofavorinternationalagenciesthatcanhandlemarketingcommunicationfortheprod-\nuctinboththedomesticandinternationalmarkets.Alocalizedeffort,incontrast,favorsuseoflo-\ncal agencies for planning and implementation in all of the countries where the product is\ndistributed.

The results of the cam-\npaign were nothing short of a blowout. For its short-term goal, Nintendo wanted to sell 600,000 units from\nits launch in November through the end of the year. It nearly doubled that goal, outselling its Sony rival by\nmore than 50 percent during that period. A midterm objective aimed to make Nintendo a rival with Sony and\nMicrosoft by gaining at least a third of the market by the end of 2007. It beat the year-end goal in less than\nsix months. Amazingly in July sales topped the combined sales for both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The long-\nterm goal of fundamentally changing how people experience video games paid off too. Wii parties became\nthe rage. The key purchasers, moms, decided that the Wii was okay for their families. All sorts of people from\nyoung families to retirees caught the Wii bug, got off the couch, and started to play.\nNintendo was honored for its effective efforts with a Grand Effie. “Leo Burnett’s marketing strategy for\nthe Wii will forever change the gaming industry and its dialogue with consumers,” said Deborah Meyer, who\nchaired the Grand Effie jury. This phenomenal marketing effort continues to pay dividends, as Nintendo re-\ncently was judged tops in game ads for effectiveness and impact in print, television, and digital media.\n58 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nKey Points Summary\n1.How is marketing defined,what is the marketing unique and distinctive and by making a promisethat sets\nprocess,and what are marketing’s key concepts? customers’expectations.
