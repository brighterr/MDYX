Religion is sometimes a\nuseful factor because of the increasing importance of product bans. In terms of demographics,\nChristianity is the largest religion both in the United States and in the world. Islam is one of the\nfastest growing faiths in the world and may soon overtake Christianity in numbers worldwide. As\nan indication of that growth, National Public Radio reported that Mohammadhas become the top\nmale name in England, many European cities, and also in the world.30There is also a large per-\ncentage of the population, both in the United States and worldwide, that is secular or unaffiliated\nwith any organized religion.\nSome religions forbid certain products. Mormons, for example, avoid tea, coffee, caffeinated\nsoft drinks, alcohol, and tobacco. Muslims also avoid alcohol and both Muslims and Jews avoid\npork products, as well as other food products that aren’t certified as halal (Muslim) or kosher\n(Jewish). Most religions celebrate gift giving, such as some Native American faiths and Chris-\ntianity at Christmastime. Other religions affect people’s choice of clothing and adornment. Reli-\ngion has also become a huge factor in determining political choices and adherence to certain\ncauses. It depends on the product category, but religion can be a key factor in identifying those\nwho are or are not in the market for a good, service, or idea.\nCHAPTER 5 • SEGMENTING AND TARGETING THE AUDIENCE 145\nGeography Marketers study the sales patterns of different parts of the country because people\nresiding in different regions need certain products. For example, someone living in the Midwest\nor the Northeast is more likely to purchase products for removing snow and ice than a Floridian.\nDifferences also exist between urban areas and suburban or rural areas. Swimming pools that sell\nwell in a residential suburban neighborhood would not be in demand in an urban neighborhood\nfilled with apartment buildings.\nAnotherimportantroleforgeographyisinmediaplanningwhereadesignatedmarketarea\n(DMA)isusedindescribingmediamarkets.ADMAisidentifiedbythenameofthedominantcity\ninthatareaanditgenerallyalignswiththereachoflocaltelevisionsignals.TheSeattle-Tacoma\nDMAinWashington,forexample,coverssome13countiesinthenorthwestcornerofthestate.\nPsychographics\nJust as demographics relates to social characteristics, psychographics summarizes personal fac-\ntors.
