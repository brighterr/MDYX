Which of these logos do you think are the most effective?\nCHAPTER 2 • INTEGRATED BRAND COMMUNICATION 49\nIfbrandingworks,thenyourefertoaspecificbrandbyname,ratherthanagenericcategorywhen\ndiscussingaproduct.Brandidentitycuesaregenerallythebrandnameandthesymbolusedasa\nlogo—thinkofthe“swish”graphicthatsymbolizesNikeandtheleapingcatforPuma.\nThe choice of a brand name for new products is tested for memorability and relevance. The\nidea is that the easier it is to recognize the identity cues, the easier it will be to create awareness\nof the brand. That also makes it easy to find and repurchase a brand, which is an important fac-\ntor in customer repurchase decisions. Successful brand names have several characteristics:\n• DistinctiveAcommon name that is unrelated to a product category, such as Apple for a\ncomputer, ensures there will be no similar names creating confusion. It can also be provoca-\ntive, as in the Virgin line.\n• AssociationSubaru, for example, chose Outback as the name for its rugged SUVhoping the\nname would evoke the adventure of the Australian wilderness.\n• BenefitSome brand names relate to the brand promise, such as Slim-Fast for\nweight loss and Head & Shoulders for dandruff control shampoo.\n• HeritageSome brand names reflect the maker, such as H&R Block, Kellogg’s,\nand Dr. Scholl’s. The idea is that there is credibility in a product when makers\nare proud to put their names on it, particularly in some international markets,\nsuch as Japan, where the company behind the brand is an important part of the\nbrand image.\n• SimplicityTo make a brand name easier to recognize and remember, brand\nnames are often short and easy to pronounce, such as Tide, Bic, and Nike. Be-\ncause of the increase in multinational marketing, it is also important that names\nproperly translate into other languages.\nWhen Coke moved into the Chinese market in the late 1970s, it faced the im-\nmediate problem of translating its well-known brand name into Chinese. Of course,\nthere are no equivalent Chinese words for CocaorCola,and phonetic-based trans-\nlations were meaningless. The ingenious solution was to use a group of four charac-\nters (cid:3978)(cid:3966)(cid:3978)(cid:1060) the first half means “tasty” or “delicious,” the next two characters\ntogether mean “really happy.” Although it has come to stand as a generic phrase for\ncola, the name for Coke in Chinese is roughly “tasty happy” cola. So Coke owns the\nAlthough the distinctive logo\ncategory. The effectiveness of the Chinese trademark has been an important factor in mak-\nis known around the world,\ning Coca\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
