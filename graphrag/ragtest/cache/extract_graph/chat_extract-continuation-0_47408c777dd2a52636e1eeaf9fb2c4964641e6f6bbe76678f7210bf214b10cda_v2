Our answer to the question of how advertising works is to\npropose that effective advertising creates six types of consumer responses: (1) see/hear, (2) feel,\n(3) think/understand, (4) connect, (5) believe, and (6) act/do—all of which work together to cre-\nate the response to a brand message. These six consumer responses and the categories of effects\nto which they belong are represented in Figure 4.3.\nThink, of these six effects as facets—polished surfaces like those of a diamond or crystal—\nthat come together to make up a unique consumer response to an advertising message. The ef-\nfects are holistic in the sense that they lead to an impression, or what Preston calls an “integrated\nperception.”21An effective message has a diamond-like quality that represents how the message\neffects work together to create the desired consumer response. The effects can vary in importance\nwith some advertising campaigns more focused on one or several of the facets.\nFIGURE 4.3\nThe Facets Model\nof Effects\nsee/hear feel\nPerception Emotion\nthink/understand believe\nCognition Persuasion\nconnect act\nAssociation Behavior\nCHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 107\nHere is a table to help you analyze the impact of an advertisement in terms of the type of ob-\njective the ad is trying to achieve and how that will be apparent in the way consumers respond to\nthe message. The final column lists factors that can be measured to determine if you achieved the\ndesired type of impact.\nCommunication Objective Consumer Response Factors That Drive a Response\nPerception See/Hear Exposure, selection and attention,\ninterest, relevance, curiosity,\nawareness, recognition\nEmotional/Affective Feel Wants and desires, excitement,\nfeelings, liking, resonance\nCognition Think/Understand Need, cognitive learning,\ncomprehension, differentiation,\nrecall\nAssociation Connect Symbolism, conditioned learning,\ntransformation\nPersuasion Believe Motivation, influence,\ninvolvement, engagement,\nconviction, preference and\nintention, loyalty, believability\nand credibility\nBehavior Act/Do Mental rehearsal, trial, buying,\ncontacting, advocating and\nreferrals, prevention\nLet’s now explore these six categories of effects in more detail. We’ll start with perception,\nwhich is where the consumer response to an advertisement begins.\nThe Perception Facet: See/Hear\nEvery day we are bombarded with stimuli—faces, conversations, scents, sounds, advertisements,\nnews announcements—yet we actually notice only a small fraction of those stimuli. Why?\nThe answer is perception. Perceptionis the process by which we receive information through Principle\nour five senses and assign meaning to it. If an advertisement is to be effective, first of all, it must For an advertisement to\nget noticed. It has to be seen or heard, even if the perception is minimal and largely below the level be effective, it first has to\nof awareness. We “see” ads in magazines even if we page through the publication without stop- get noticed or at least\nping to read them; we “see” commercials on TVeven as we zip through a recorded program. The register on some minimal\nchallenge is to create breakthrough advertising, messages that get attention and stick in the mind. level on our senses.\nOur minds are full of impressions that we have collected without much active thought or\nconcentration. Of course, on occasion we do stop and read an ad or watch a commercial all the\nway through, so there are various degrees and levels of perception. The Burger King “Freakout”\nads were particularly effective at breaking through inattention and building awareness. Break-\nthrough advertising, then, is advertising that breaks through the perceptual filters and makes an\nimpression on the audience.\nFactors That Drive the Perception Response Consumers select messages to which they pay at-\ntention, a process called selective perception.Here’s how perception works: Some ads for some\nproduct categories—personal hygiene products, for example—battle for attention because peo-\nple don’t choose to watch them. However, if the message breaks through the disinterest and is se-\nlected and attended to, then the consumer may react to it with interest if it is relevant. The result\nis awareness of the ad or brand, which is filed in memory at least to the point that the consumer\nrecognizes the brand or ad.\nThe key factors driving perception, then, are exposure, selection and attention, interest, rel-\nevance, curiosity, awareness, and recognition. Here is a brief review of these terms and how they\nrelate to advertising impact:\n• ExposureThe first test of perception is whether a marketing communication message is\nseen or heard. In advertising, this is called exposure,which is an important goal of media\nplanners who try to find the best way to reach consumers with a message.\n108 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\n• Selection and AttentionThe next factor that drives perception is selective attention,the\nprocess by which a receiver of a message chooses to attend to a message. Amid all the clut-\nter in the media environment, selection is a huge problem. The ability to draw attention that\nbrings visibility to a brand is one of advertising’s greatest strengths. Advertisements, particu-\nlarly television commercials, are often designed to be intrusive,which means they intrude\non people’s perception in order to grab attention.\n• InterestAfactor in crossing the selection barrier\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMERITEST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ameritest is a research company that evaluates effective commercials using perception, brand association, and persuasion<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURGER KING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Burger King is a fast-food chain known for its \"Freakout\" ads that effectively break through inattention and build awareness<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMERITEST<|>BURGER KING<|>Ameritest's evaluation criteria of perception, brand association, and persuasion are exemplified by Burger King's effective \"Freakout\" ads<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
