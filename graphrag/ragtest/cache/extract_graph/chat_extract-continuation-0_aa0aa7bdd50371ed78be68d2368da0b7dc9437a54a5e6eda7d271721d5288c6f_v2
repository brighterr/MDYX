Although public re-\nlations has a distinguished tradition, people often\nmistake it for publicity,which refers to getting news\nmedia coverage. Publicity, however, is focused on the\nnews media and their audiences, which is just one aspect\nof public relations, and it carries no direct media costs.\nEven when public relations uses paid-for media like ad-\nvertising, the message focuses on the organization, with\nlittle or no attempt to sell a brand or product line.\n• ControlIn the case of news stories, the public relations\nstrategist is at the mercy of the media gatekeeper. There\nis no guarantee that all or even part of a story will ap-\npear. PR writers write the story, send it to the media, and\ncross their fingers that this story will appear. In fact,\nthere is the real risk that a story may be rewritten or re-\norganized by an editor so that it no longer means what\nthe strategist intended. In contrast, advertising runs ex-\nactly as the client who paid for it has approved and it\nruns as scheduled.\n• CredibilityThe public tends to trust the media more than\nthey do advertisers. This consumer tendency to confer\nPepsi invites customers to submit ideas about good causes legitimacy on information simply because it appears in\nthat need support, which are listed on the campaign’s the news is called the implied third-party endorsement\nwebsite and then voted on by visitors to the site. factor. Thomas Harris, in his book Value-Added Public\nCHAPTER 15 • PUBLIC RELATIONS 463\nRelations,observes that today’s sophisticated and skeptical consumers know when they are\nbeing informed and when they are being “sold to.” He explains, “PR closes the marketing\ncredibility gap because it is the one marketing communication tool devoted to providing in-\nformation, not salesmanship.”9\nIn a recent study researchers found that a media placement has about the same effectiveness\nas advertising. Contrary to the oft-repeated assumption that editorial coverage generates more\nvalue than equivalent advertising, they did not find that PR scored higher on most of the mea-\nsures: brand recognition, message believability, overall interest, or consumer preference.10\nAnother way to build credibility is through corporate social responsibility.John Paluszek,\nsenior counsel at Ketchum, an expert in the area of public relations corporate social responsi-\nbility, and a member of our advisory board, says, “One of the great growth areas for PR is cor-\nporate social responsibility/sustainable development/corporate citizenship.”11 Many examples\nconfirm this trend of doing well by doing good. For example, Bill Gates’philanthropic efforts\nboosted public opinion of Microsoft and generated goodwill for his corporation in the process.\nGeneral Electric’s Ecomagination campaign helps raise awareness of sustainability issues\n(http://ge.ecomagination.com). The Pepsi Refresh Project aims to raise at least $20 million for\ndonations to local organizations and causes proposed by the public in health, arts and culture,\nthe environment, and education.12Often these efforts use advertising to accomplish their public\nrelations goals.\nWHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES\nOF PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAMS?\nThe word relationsinpublic relationsrefers to relationships with various stakeholders. In fact,\nthe main subspecialties in the field—public affairs, media relations, employee relations, and fi-\nnancial relations—call attention to important relationships with such groups as the general pub-\nlic, media, employees, and the financial community. Figure 15.1outlines the various publics, or\nstakeholders, for a multinational company. The term relationship marketingintroduces a point\nof view in marketing planning that evolved from public relations.13\nThe key publics addressed by relationship programs in public relations are the media, em-\nployees, members, shareholders and others in the financial community, government, and general\npublic. Here are the specialty areas that focus on these relationship programs:\n• Media RelationsThe area that focuses on developing media contacts—that is, knowing who\nin the media might be interested in the organization’s story—is called media relations.\nWhen you say public relations,most people immediately think about publicity, which indi-\ncates the importance of this media function. The organization initiates publicity and provides\npertinent information to the media. Asuccessful relationship between a public relations per-\nson and editors and producers is built on a PR person’s reputation for honesty, accuracy, and\nprofessionalism. Once this reputation is tarnished or lost, the public relations person cannot\nfunction effectively as a liaison between a company and the media.\n• Employee RelationsPrograms that communicate information to employees are called\nemployee relations.This function may belong to public relations, although it may also be\nthe responsibility of human resources. Arelated program is called internal marketing,\nwhich deals with communication efforts aimed at informing employees about marketing\nprograms and encouraging their support.\n• Financial RelationsAll the communication efforts aimed at the financial community, such\nas press releases sent to business publications, meetings with investors and analysts, and the\nannual report, which the federal government requires of publicly held companies, are re-\nferred to as financial relations.\n• Public AffairsCorporate communication programs with government and with the public on\nissues related to government and regulation are called public affairs.For example, a com-\npany building a new plant may need to gain the approval of government health and public\nsafety regulators.
