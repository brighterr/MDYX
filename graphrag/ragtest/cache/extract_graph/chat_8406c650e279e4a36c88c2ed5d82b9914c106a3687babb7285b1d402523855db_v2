Check out www.AdBusters.orgfor a look inside the\nworld of advertising criticism. We start this chapter with three important\ndebates concerning the role of advertising and marketing communica-\ntion as institutions in society that will help you understand different as-\npects of social responsibility.\nWhat Are the Debates about Marcom’s Social Role?\nIn this section we review some of the issues related to advertising’s\nCLASSIC\nroleinsociety.Ourintentionistoreviewthecriticisms,butunderstand\nA J.

They focus on demand creation, do you see it now?\nshapingversusmirroringofsocialtrends,andtheovercommercializa-\ntionofsociety.\nDemand Creation Some critics charge that advertising causes demand creation,which results\nwhen an external message drives people to feel a need or want—sometimes unnecessarily. A2009\nHarris Poll indicated that two-thirds of Americans believed ad agencies were at least partially to\nblame for the recent economic crisis because they caused people to buy things they couldn’t af-\nford.2Others reject this notion. Does advertising create demand for products people don’t need?\nHas advertising convinced you to buy products you don’t need?\nLet’sstartthediscussionbyconsideringdeodorants.Didyouknowthatnooneuseddeodor-\nantsmuchuntilabout1919?Peopledidn’tworryabouthavingbodyodor.Anadforanewproduct,\nOdorono(greatname,andit’sstillbeingused,bytheway),targetedwomenbecauseeveryoneas-\nsumedthatmenweresupposedtoemitbadodorsandwomenwouldbethemorelikelyusersofthe\nproduct.ThelaunchadinLadies’HomeJournalsooffendedreadersthatabout200peoplecanceled\ntheirsubscription.Theadswereeffective,however.Salesforthedeodorantrose112percent.3Did\nadvertisingmakewomenbuysomethingtheydidn’tevenknowtheyneeded?Wasthatabadthing?\nIf you think it doesn’t happen today, think about Unilever’s Axe product. Axe pioneered the\nnew category of body spray for men in 2002. Did guys know before 2002 that they needed scented\nbody spray? Is it a good thing advertising convinces people to buy products like deodorants and\nbody sprays? Can such advertising improve consumers’lives?\nCompanies often conduct significant research to find out what consumers want before they\nlaunch new products. If people do not want the products being marketed, they do not buy them.\nAdvertising may convince people to buy a product—even a bad one—once. If they try the prod-\nPrinciple\nuct and don’t like it, they won’t buy it again. So to some extent advertising creates demand. At\nIf people do not want the\nthe same time, it is important to remember that audiences may refuse to purchase the product if products being marketed,\nthey don’t feel a need for it. they do not buy them.\n66 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nShaping versus Mirroring Another important debate about advertising’s role\nin society questions the limits of its influence. At what point does advertising\ncross the line between reflecting social values and creating them? Professionals\nbelieve they are reflecting the values of their society. Critics argue that adver-\ntising has repeatedly crossed this line, influencing vulnerable groups, such as\nchildren and young teenagers, too strongly.\nAcase in point: Do ultra-thin models in advertising cause young women\nto have eating disorders, as some have claimed? While it is probable that the im-\nages women and girls see influence them in some ways, it’s difficult to say that\nthese images directly and solely cause the problem, because many factors in a\nperson’s environment potentially influence eating choices. Some research,\nhowever, supports the view that advertising is partly to blame; advertising may\ncontribute to the problem. What do you think?\nCan advertising manipulate people’s choices? Critics of advertising argue\nthat advertising can create social trends and has the power to dictate how people\nthink and act. They believe that even if an individual ad cannot control behavior,\nthe cumulative effects of nonstop television, radio, print, Internet, and outdoor\nads can be overwhelming. Others contend that effective brand communication\nspots trends and then develops messages that connect target audiences with the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
