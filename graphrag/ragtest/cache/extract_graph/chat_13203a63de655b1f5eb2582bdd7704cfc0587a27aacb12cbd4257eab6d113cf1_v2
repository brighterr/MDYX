Personal sales are even more impor-\ntant in business-to-business marketing for reaching key decision makers within a company who\ncan authorize a purchase.\nThe management challenge, then, is to manage all of the messages delivered by all aspects\nof the marketing mix, including marketing communication, so they work together to present the\nbrand in a coherent and consistent way.8\nWHAT IS MARCOM’S ROLE IN BRANDING?\nAmanagement function that creates the tangible and intangible elements of a brand is called\nbranding. Through effective marketing communication that establishes a unique identity, the\nbrand engages the hearts and minds of consumers in a process that differentiates similar products\nfrom each other.\nGiven your experience, how would you define a brand? You have pieces of a definition from\nour previous questions: past positive experience, familiarity, a promise, a position, an image.\nHere’s how we would define a brand: A perception, often imbued with emotion, which results\nfrom experiences with and information about a company or a line of products.Other definitions\npoint to a mixture of tangible and intangible attributes, as well as the symbolic importance of the\ntrademark, which stands for the brand, and the value the brand offers to both the consumer and\nthe company. We’ll explain these factors in the following discussion.\nAbrand is more than a product. Hamburgers are products—but the Big Mac and Whopper\nPrinciple\nare brands.

Branding applies to services as well as goods—State Farm and the U.S. Postal Ser-\nproducts but sell brands. vice (USPS) are also brands—and to nonprofits, such as United Way and Habitat for Humanity\nIn fact, all organizations with a name can be considered brands. The A Matter of Practice\nfeature explains how organization brands are distinct from product brands. In particular, as inter-\nnational branding expert Giep Franzen explains: “Organizations should be aware that simply by\nexisting and interacting with others, an organization is branding itself. So branding the organiza-\ntion is inevitable. It is going to happen whether the process is managed or not.”\nSometimes the difference between brands in the same product category lies in product\nfeatures—how the hamburger is made and the chemistry of the toothpaste—but often we\nchoose one brand over another because of a difference in the brand impressions we carry.\nCompanies make products but they sell brands. Abrand differentiates a product from its com-\npetitors and makes a promise to its customers.\nBranding involves a complex set of philosophies and activities.
