Remember, an objectiveis a goal to be accomplished; in ad-\nvertising, objectives are determined by the effects you want to achieve. Astrategyis the means,\nthe design or plan, by which the objective is accomplished—the advertising message and media\nstrategies, for example. In advertising, tactics are the way the ads and other marketing commu-\nnication efforts are executed—how they are designed and what they say.\nIn the Coke Zero case, the objective was to position Coke Zero as tasting like regular Coke.\nThe strategy was to use taste tests so the young male target could experience how similar the\ntastes were. The tactic was to use the idea of “taste infringement” complete with lawyers, actors,\nand imaginary lawsuits.\nWe talk a lot about creativity in this book and we’d like to emphasize that strategic thinking\nis just as creative as coming up with a Big Idea for a marketing communication campaign. Both\nprocesses involve searching for ideas to solve problems, whether they are found in marketing sit-\nuations or communication challenges. Pat Fallon and Fred Senn, cofounders of the legendary\nagency Fallon Worldwide, explain that principle in their book, Juicing the Orange:How to Turn\nCreativity into a Powerful Business Advantage.They have identified seven principles that link\ncreative thinking and strategic planning to business results1:\n1. Always Start from ScratchSimplify the problem. You know too much. There’s a good\nchance that you know so much that you can’t see how the problem could be solved in a\nfresh way.\n2. Demand a Ruthlessly Simple Definition of the Business ProblemSmart people tend to\nmake things too complicated. Be a relentless reductionist. Einstein said, “Make things as\nsimple as possible, but no simpler.”\n3. Discover a Proprietary EmotionThe key component of any communication program is a\npowerful consumer insight that leads to a ruthlessly smart strategy executed brilliantly\nacross all platforms. It all starts with the insight, which is the central truth of what you are Pat Fallon (top) and\nFred Senn were\ngoing to say and how you are going to operate. Once you find an emotional truth, you can\ncofounders of Fallon\nmake it proprietary through execution.\nWorldwide, the agency\n4. Focus on the Size of the Idea,Not the Size of the BudgetIt’s our credo that it’s better to\nbehind NBC, Holiday\noutsmart than outspend.\nInn Express, Travelers\n5. Seek Out Strategic RisksUnderstand the benefits of prudent risk. Great big ideas in the\nInsurance, Sony, and\nearly stages are often scary ideas. When Darwin taught us about the survival of the fittest, many other major\nhe didn’t mean the strongest. He meant that it’s the most nimble—the quickest to adapt to brands.\na changing environment—who prosper both in nature and in a capitalist economy.\n6. Collaborate or PerishThis is more than “getting along”; it is about recognizing that the rules\nof engagement have changed. We live in an era in which victory goes to the best collabora-\ntors. This means teams from different disciplines and different corporate cultures will be\nworking together. Teams that are aligned and motivated can make history.\n7. Listen Hard to Your Customers (Then Listen Some More)Listening is often step Number\nOne on the road to understanding. Listening often yields that precious insight that gives\nyou a competitive advantage; something your competitors have overlooked.\nThe Business Plan\nStrategic planning is a three-tiered process that starts with the business plan and then moves to\nfunctional areas of the company such as marketing where a marketing plan is developed that out-\nlines objectives, strategies, and tactics for all areas of the marketing mix. As illustrated in Figure 7.1,\nboth the business plan and the marketing plan provide direction to specific plans for specialist\nareas, such as advertising and other areas of marketing communication.\nAbusiness plan may cover a specific division of the company or a strategic business unit\n(SBU),whichisalineofproductsoralltheofferingsunderasinglebrandname.Thesedivisions,or\nSBUs,shareacommonsetofproblemsandfactors.Figure7.2depictsawidelyusedframeworkfor\nthestrategicplanningprocessinbusiness.Theobjectivesforplanningatthisleveltendtofocuson\nmaximizingprofitandreturnoninvestment(ROI).ROIisameasurementthatshowswhether,in\ngeneral,thecostsofconductingthebusiness—theinvestment—aremorethanmatchedbytherev-\nenueproducedinreturn.Therevenueaboveandbeyondthecostsiswhereprofitlies.\n192 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nFIGURE 7.1\nCorporate Plan\nStrategic Planning from\nTop to Bottom\nBusiness planning involves a\nCorporate Strategy\nset of cascading objectives\nand strategies.

The mission statement is unique,\nfocused, and differentiating.
