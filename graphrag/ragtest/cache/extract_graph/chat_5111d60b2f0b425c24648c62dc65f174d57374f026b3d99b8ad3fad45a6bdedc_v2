They can also save it and reread. Be-\ncause the print message format is less fleeting than broadcast and more concrete, people tend to\nspend more time with print and absorb its messages more carefully. Print can be highly engaging\nwhen targeted toward audiences that have a special interest in the publicationâ€™s content, such as\nwomen and womenâ€™s magazines.\nPrint has the ability to engage more of the senses than other media because it can be both\ntactile (different types of paper and other surfaces) and aural (smell). Magazines, for example,\nhave long offered scratch â€™nâ€™sniff ads, particularly for perfume, and thatâ€™s becoming more com-\nmon in newspapers. Newspapers have announced the availability of aromatic ads, so the smell of\ncoffee may waft from your morning newspaper sometime soon.\nNewspaper Basics\nNewspapersâ€™primary function is to carry news, which means that marketers with news to an-\nPrinciple\nnounce, such as a special sale or new product, may find newspapers to be a comfortable envi-\nA basic principle of\nronment.

The New York Timesserves the New York region, but it also has a national circulation,\nparticularly for its Sunday edition. Local papers are struggling to survive but their readers still\nvalue them for their coverage of local politics, education, crime, sports stories, local events,\nchurch news, and local people features.\nRetailers like to place ads and press releases in daily\nnewspapers because their lead time (the advance time\nneeded to produce a publication) is shortâ€”just a few days.\nFood stores, for example, can change offers and pricing\nquickly depending on product availability. Also, because\nmost newspapers are local, retailers arenâ€™t paying to reach\npeople who live outside their shopping area.\nNewspapers can be categorized according to their pub-\nlication frequency, such as dailies, weeklies, and Sunday edi-\ntions. In addition, business and organizational newspapers\nare available to trade and membership groups.\nAlthoughnewspapersgotoamassaudience,theyoffer\nmarket selectivity,whichallowsthemtotargetspecificcon-\nsumer groups.

The two largest U.S.\nnewspapers,USA Todayand the Wall Street Journal,continue to be leaders, although circulation\nhas eroded for them, as well as for many local newspapers. To balance the budget, Dow Jones,\nthe owner of the Wall Street Journal,has sold six newspapers, cut WSJstaff and costs, including\nreducing the page size, and increased its emphasis on its other media and Internet publishing op-\nportunities to reduce its dependence on print ad revenue. The WSJ, however, is one of few news-\npapers to gain circulation during the recession.1 USA Today reported a 17 percent drop in\ncirculation in 2009, which threatens its number one position. The biggest problem it faces is a\ntravel slump, which has hurt USA Todayâ€™shotel circulation.\nOther sources of revenue besides advertising include reader subscriptions and single-copy\nsales at newsstands. Circulation is the primary way newspapersâ€™reach is measured and compared\nwith the reach of other media. USA Todayâ€™scirculation is different from other daily newspapers\nin that it is targeted to travelers and its primary sales consist of single-copy sales and bulk sales\nto hotels, rather than subscriptions.
