The decision to expand the mar-\nket (strategy) by increasing share of wallet (objective) is implemented through promotional tac-\ntics (“buy four and get one free”).\nAnother factor in the brand communication strategy is determining the role and importance of\nthe brand’s competitive position and how to respond to competitor’s messages. During the recession,\nfor example, a number of major brands, such as Dunkin’Donuts, Burger King, and Campbell’s Soup\ndeveloped highly competitive advertising. Domino’s Pizza, for example, used an aggressive cam-\npaign comparing its oven-baked sandwiches as tasting better than Subway’s hoagies. This is a strat-\negy often seen in economic downturns, which analysts describe as “a dogfight” for market share.18\nOther strategy decisions involve the use of a celebrity spokesperson who becomes the face of\nthe brand. Acrisis in emotional branding happened when celebrity superstar Tiger Woods was\ncaught up in a sex scandal. That event moved him from one of the most respected celebrity en-\ndorsers to a flawed figure with questionable integrity. His sponsors, including Nike and Accenture,\namong others, had to decide how to relate their brands not only to his long-time dominance of golf,\nbut also his loss of honor. It’s not just the brand images that were threatened by Tiger’s infidelities;\neconomists estimate the loss to shareholders of his nine corporate sponsors as close to $12 billion.19\nFor another example, American Express sponsored a four-minute humorous online com-\nmercial featuring comedian Jerry Seinfeld and an animated Superman that was designed to cre-\nate brand liking. The two sidekicks play the role of neurotic New Yorkers complaining about\nCHAPTER 7 • STRATEGIC PLANNING 209\nsuch earth-shaking topics as the amount of mayonnaise on their tuna\nsandwiches. They also relate the benefits of using an American Ex-\npress card. The message is soft sell and embedded in a gag, which\nmakes the commercial feel more like cinema than advertising. Sein-\nfeld jokes that it isn’t going to be interrupted by a commercial because\nit is a commercial.20\nOnce the strategies have been identified, the next step is imple-\nmentation. Next we discuss the budgeting and evaluation aspects of\nimplementation. The budget is a critical part of planning an advertis-\ning campaign.\nAn online mini-film commercial for American\nBudgeting A$50,000budgetwillonlystretchsofarandprobably Express featuring Jerry Seinfeld was designed to\nwillnotbeenoughtocoverthecostsoftelevisionadvertisinginmost entertain and create brand liking.

Typically, a\ndollar amount, say $370,000, is budgeted for advertising during the budget planning process (just\nbefore the end of the fiscal year). The big budgeting question at the marketing mix and market-\ning communication mix level is: How much do we need to spend? Let’s examine five common\nbudgeting methods used to answer that question:\n• Historical MethodHistorical information is the source for this common budgeting method.\nAbudget may simply be based on last year’s budget, with a percentage increase for inflation\nor some other marketplace factor. This method, although easy to calculate, has little to do\nwith reaching advertising objectives.\n• Objective-Task MethodTheobjective-task methodlooks at the objectives for each activity\nand determines the cost of accomplishing each objective. For example, what will it cost to\nmake 50 percent of the people in the market aware of this product? This method’s advantage\nis that it develops the budget from the ground up so that objectives are the starting point.\n• Percentage-of-Sales MethodThepercentage-of-sales methodcompares the total sales with\nthe total advertising (or marketing communication) budget during the previous year or the\naverage of several years to compute a percentage. This technique can also be used across an\nindustry to compare the expenditures of different product categories on advertising. For ex-\nample, if a company had sales of $5 million last year and an advertising budget of $1 mil-\nlion, then the ratioof advertising to sales would be 20 percent. If the marketing manager\npredictssalesof $6 million for next year, then the ad budget would be $1.2 million. How\ncan we calculate the percentage of sales and apply it to a budget?
