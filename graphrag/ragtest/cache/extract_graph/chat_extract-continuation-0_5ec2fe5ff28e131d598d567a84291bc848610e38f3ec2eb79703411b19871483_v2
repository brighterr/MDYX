Their real usage was mostly for daily chores: grocery shopping, driv-\ning children to school, and so on, with a light mixture of rural activities.\nAll our headlines challenged the target group to match the car to specific\ntasks, chores, and situations. All headlines started with the challenge “Match CR-V\n. . .” and were the building blocks for universal themes in all promotional materials\nfor the CR-V, making good use of digital media and promotional activities along\nwith more traditional media. When tested these headlines were shown to engage\nthe target group and their imaginations. Different target groups identified with dif-\nferent headlines.\nThe result was beyond our dreams. You can find out more about what we\nachieved by turning to the end of the chapter and reading It’s a Wrap.\nThe Honda CR-Vcase is about an award-winning integrated campaign that illustrates how inter-\nnational marketers make decisions about their local advertising. It combines two of the subjects\nwe cover in this chapter, integration and international advertising. Other topics in this chapter are\nretail, business-to-business (B2B), and nonprofit marketing communication. All these specialized\nareas use many of the basic marketing communication IMC principles and generally strive to co-\nordinate their messages; however, there are some distinct differences that we will call to your at-\ntention in this chapter.\nIMC MANAGEMENT\nWe’re near the end of this book. If you have any interest in working in marketing or marketing\ncommunication, what have you learned about integrated marketing communication that might\nhelp you in your career? The industry is definitely moving in that direction. Astudy by the As-\nsociation of National Advertisers (ANA) in 2008, for example, found that 74 percent of ANA\nmembers said they were using IMC for most or all of their brands. The association’s CEO sees\nthat as a call for “Renaissance Marketers” who understand the essentials of IMC. He describes\nCHAPTER 18 • THE IMC UMBRELLA 547\nthem as “a new breed of holistic professionals who are system thinkers, customer-centric be-\nlievers, innovators, and dreamers.”1 So there’s definitely a job opportunity here—does that\nsound like you?\nMaybe you’re even thinking about starting a business or going to graduate school and be-\ncoming a consultant. If so, it’s important to understand the concept of advertising has broadened\nto include almost everything that sends a brand message, a practice we have been calling IMC. If\nyou go to work in marketing or marketing communication, you may be asked to help plan an IMC\ncampaign. So let’s wrap up our chapters on the various types of marketing communication and\nsee how what you’ve learned in this book fits together from a manager’s perspective.\nOne lesson you may have learned is that in marketing communication campaigns, the ob-\njective is to create consistency among all the marcom tools. That’s essentially a tactical approach,\none that’s focused on orchestrating consistent brand messages. In the Part 5 opener, Duncan re-\nferred to this as a “one-voice, one-look” strategy, which is a critical goal for campaigns. So let’s\nlook at the type of IMC planning that delivers marketing communication consistency. Then we’ll\nturn to the big picture of managing a total brand communicationprogram.\nManaging IMC Campaigns\nAnIMCcampaignisacomplexsetofinterlocking,coordinatedactivitiesthathasabeginning\nand end.An IMC campaign plan outlines the objectives and strategies for a series of different\nbut related marketing communication efforts that appear in different media, use different mar-\nketing communication tools, and convey different but complementary brand-consistent mes-\nsagestoavarietyofstakeholdersusingstrategicconsistency.Strategicconsistencycomesfrom\nthe creative theme and the consistent presentation of the brand position and personality, even\nwhen different stakeholders groups receive different types of messages and interact with the\nbrandindifferentways.\nConsistency is a product of a carefully designed multiplatform and multimedia plan. For ex-\nample, consider the CR-Vcampaign. The agency’s owner, Ingvi Logason, explained:\nThe media emphasis had been on print with support from TVand the Internet. We shifted\nthe emphasis to a 360-degree integrated approach where we focused, among other things,\non media with large reach at the expense of high frequency. TVand interactive Web ban-\nners were at the forefront of the campaign with support from newspaper, radio, and event\nmarketing. We also extended the traditional media with sponsorship of some big sports and\ncultural events that tied in with the car owners’lifestyles.\nStanRichards,founderoftheDallas-basedRichardsGroupexplainstheprocesshisagency\ngoes through in planning an integrated campaign.
