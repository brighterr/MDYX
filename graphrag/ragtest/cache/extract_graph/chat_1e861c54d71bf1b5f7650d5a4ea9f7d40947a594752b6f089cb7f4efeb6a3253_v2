A\nPractical Tips box at www.pearsonhighered.com/moriarty explains what one researcher has\nlearnedabouttheapplicationofHofstede’sprinciplestoadvertising.\nThe outgrowth of the local-versus-global debate has been three schools of thought on ad-\nvertising across national borders:\n• StandardizationThestandardizationschool of thought contends that differences between\ncountries are a matter of degree, so advertisers must instead focus on the similarities of con-\nsumers and a consistent brand presentation.\n• Localization (Adaptation)Thelocalizationoradaptationschool of thought argues that ad-\nvertisers must consider differences among countries, including local culture, stage of eco-\nnomic and industrial development, stage of life cycle, media availability, research\navailability, and legal restrictions.\n• CombinationThis approach reasons that a combination of standardization and localization\nmay produce the most effective advertising. Some elements of brand identity and strategy,\nfor example, may be standardized, but advertising executions may need to be adapted to the\nlocal culture.\nThe reality of global advertising suggests that a combination approach is often best.
