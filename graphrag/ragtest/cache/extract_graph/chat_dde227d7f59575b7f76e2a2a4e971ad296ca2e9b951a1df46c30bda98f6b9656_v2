But let’s summarize these concepts in terms of a simple set of key\ncomponents that describe the practice of advertising: strategy, message, media, and Message Evaluation\nevaluation (see Figure 1.2):\n• StrategyThe logic behind an advertisement is stated in objectives that focus on FIGURE 1.2\nareas such as sales, news, psychological appeals, emotion, branding and brand Four Components of Advertising\n18 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nreputation, as well as the position and differentiation of the product from the competition,\nand segmenting and targeting the best prospects.\n• MessageThe concept behind a message and how that message is expressed is based on research and\nconsumer insights with an emphasis on creativity and artistry.\n• MediaVarious media have been used by advertisers over the centuries including print (hand-\nbills, newspapers, magazines), outdoor (signs and posters), broadcast (radio and television),\nand now digital media. Targeting ads to prospective buyers is done by matching their profiles\nto media audiences. Advertising agency compensation was originally based on the cost of\nbuying time or space in the media.\n• EvaluationEffectiveness means meeting objectives and in order to determine if that has hap-\npened, there must be testing. Standards also are set by professional organizations and companies\nthat rate the size and makeup of media audiences, as well as advertising’s social responsibility.\nThis section briefly identified how various jobs and professional concepts emerged over\ntime. Let’s now put the agency world under a microscope and look deeper at the structure of the\nindustry.\nTHE AGENCY WORLD\nIn the discussion of definitions and the evolution of advertising practices, we briefly introduced\nagencies, but as a student of advertising and marketing communication you need to know more\nabout how agencies are organized and how they operate.\nWho Are the Key Players?\nAs we discuss the organization of the industry, consider that all the key players also represent job\nopportunities you might want to consider if you are interested in working in advertising or some\narea of marketing communication. The players include the advertiser (referred to by the agency\nas the client) who sponsors the message, the agency, the media, and the supplierswho provide\nexpertise. The A Matter of Practicebox about the greatest television commercial ever made in-\ntroduced a number of these key players and illustrated how they all make different contributions\nto the final advertising.\nThe Advertiser Advertising begins with the advertiser,which is the company that sponsors the\nadvertising about its business. In the “1984” story, Apple Computer was the advertiser, and Steve\nJobs, the company’s CEO, made the final decision to run the then-controversial commercial. The\nadvertiser is the number one key player. Management of this function usually lies with the mar-\nketing department but in smaller companies, such as Urban Decay Cosmetics, the advertising de-\ncisions may lie with the owner, founder, or partners in the business. Wende Zomnir is not only a\nfounding partner of Urban Decay Cosmetics, she is also an advertising graduate and a marketing\ncommunication professional.\nMost advertisers have a marketing team that initiates the advertising effort by identifying a\nmarketing problem advertising can solve. For example, Apple executives knew that the Macintosh\neasy-to-use computer platform needed to be explained and that information about the launch of\nthe new computer would need to reach a large population of potential computer buyers. Adver-\ntising was essential to the success of this new product.\nThe marketing executive (with input from the corporate officers and others on the marketing\nteam) also hires the advertising agency—for Burger King this was Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky—and\nother marketing communication agencies as needed. In professional jargon, the advertiser (Burger\nKing) becomes the agency’s client. As the client, the advertiser is responsible for monitoring the\nwork and paying the agency for its work on the account. That use of the word accountis the reason\nagency people refer to the advertiser as theaccountand the agency person in charge of that adver-\ntiser’s business as the account manager.\nThe marketing team makes the final decisions about strategy including the target audience\nand the size of the advertising budget. This team approves the advertising or marketing commu-\nnication plan, which contains details outlining the message and media strategies. In Chapter 2\nwe’ll explain more about how this marketing team functions.\nCHAPTER 1 • THE NEW WORLD OF MARKETING COMMUNICATION 19\nTHE INSIDE STORY\nA Passion for the Business\nWende Zomnir,Creative Director and Founding Partner, Urban Decay Cosmetics\nBeing the creative force behind a coming trends.
