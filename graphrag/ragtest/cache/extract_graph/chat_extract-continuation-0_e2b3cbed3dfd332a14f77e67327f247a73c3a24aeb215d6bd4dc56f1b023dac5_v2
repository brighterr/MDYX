In recent years the radio industry’s\ngrowth has been slow.\nTheStructureoftheRadioIndustry TraditionalradiostationsarefoundontheAM/FMdialand\nmostservelocalmarkets.Otheroptionsforradiolistenersincludepublicradio,cableandsatellite\n370 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nradio,low-poweredstations,andWebradio.Stationswithabroadcastrange\nof approximately 25 miles are considered local stations. Regional stations\nmaycoveranentirestateorseveralstates.\nRadio networks are groups of affiliated stations. The network system\nproduces programs and distributes them to their affiliateswho contract with\nthe system. Some of the networks include ABC Radio, Clear Channel Com-\nmunications, CNN Radio Network, the Fox Sports and Fox News networks,\nand others that deliver special-interest programming, such as talk radio.\nLocalpublic radiostations are usually affiliates of National Public Ra-\ndio (NPR) and carry much of the same programming, although they have to\nbuy or subscribe to the NPR services. For that reason, some local public ra-\ndio stations might carry a full range of NPR programming, while others that\nare less well funded may only carry a partial list of NPR programs.\nPublic radio stations are considered noncommercial in that they rely on\nlistener support for most of their funding. In recent years, however, they\nhave slowly expanded their corporate sponsorship messages. Although pub-\nlic television is losing market share to the many new cable competitors, pub-\nlic radio is growing relative to its competitors. Likewise, corporate\nunderwriting (or sponsorship) has increased along with the audience size be-\ncause public radio is one of the few media that can deliver an audience of\nwell-educated, affluent consumers.\nThe radio industry in the United States includes several other broadcast\nforms:\n• CableRadioLaunchedin1990,cableradiotechnologyusescabletele-\nvisionreceiverstodeliverstatic-freemusicviawirespluggedintocable\nsubscribers’stereos.Thethinkingbehindcableradioisthatcabletele-\nvisionneedsnewrevenueandconsumersarefedupwithcommercials\nonradio.Theservicetypicallyiscommercialfreewithamonthlysub-\nscriptionfee.\n• Satellite RadioThe newest radio technology is satellite radio.It can\nSHOWCASE\ndeliver your favorite radio stations, regardless of where you are in the\nThe Inside Storybehind this LATCH public\nservice campaign was presented in Chapter 4. continental United States.
