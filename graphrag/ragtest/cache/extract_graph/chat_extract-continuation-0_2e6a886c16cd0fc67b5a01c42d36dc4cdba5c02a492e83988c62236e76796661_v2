You’ve seen\nhow Burger King successfully kept its Whopper in the minds of the hungry,\nhow Wii became a cultural phenomenon, and how Chick-fil-A consistently\nconveys its quirky “Eat Mor Chikin” message delivered by cows on billboards. As\nthese cases demonstrate, one of the fundamental principles of successful commu-\nnication is the ability to understand how best to connect with the consumer.\nUnilever’s campaign for Dove, which won a Grand Effie and Festival of Media\nAward for “branding bravery,” provides another example of great advertising that\nrecognized a truth held by consumers and then connected on a personal level with\nthose consumers. The “Campaign for Real Beauty” touched a nerve and punctured\nthe cultural obsession with stick-thin bodies and Barbie doll images. The Dove\ncampaign was risky because it sought to literally redefine beauty in advertising and\nto acknowledge a change in the way women see themselves. It could have been a\nbomb, but it was a winner because it spoke to every woman’s need to look and feel\nher best without promising or reinforcing impossible standards of beauty.\nUnilever commissioned research that eventually drove the marketing cam-\npaign. Some startling statistics from the study included these findings:\n• Only 2 percent of the respondents believed they were beautiful.\n• Of the respondents, 68 percent indicated they strongly believed that the media\nand advertising set an unrealistic standard of beauty most women can’t achieve.\nHere’s how the Dove “Campaign for Real Beauty” unfolded.\nDove recognized it needed to reach every woman, and to do that it strategi-\ncally placed messages in many different media. The message of the Dove “Cam-\npaign for Real Beauty” provided a deliberate contrast with that of the competition\nin beauty and women’s magazines like Glamour,Allure,andVogue. Heavy empha-\nsis was placed on print rather than television because of print media’s ability to stop\nthe audience and make them really look at the models in the ad and contemplate\nthe meaning of beauty.\n419\n420 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nDove didn’t ignore broadcast media, however—they even ran an ad during\nthe Super Bowl. They also established a website (campaignforrealbeauty.com),\nwhich urges a boost in self-esteem by defying stereotypes that define beautiful as\nperfect—and skinny. Part of the campaign, a Web video titled Evolution, was a vi-\nral phenomenon that reached millions.\nSpending a fifth of the normal amount for a personal-care product launch, the\nDove advertising was concentrated in the top 10 cities where it would have the\nmost immediate impact. Outdoor and transit advertisements were plastered on\nbillboards and buses to generate public debate.\nA similar strategy was used in 2007 to launch Dove’sProAgeline, which con-\ntinues the counterintuitive strategy by celebrating older women with their silver\nhair, wrinkles, and age spots. In Canada, the campaign found its voice in Finding\nBodyandSoul,aplaycelebratingbeautythroughtheagesbywell-respectedCana-\ndianplaywrightJudithThompson.Itscastof12realwomen(notactresses)areages\n45andolder,andauditionedbywritingaletterthatstarted“DearBody....”Dove\ndevoteesalsowere\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AOL is an online service provider and web portal known for its email services and media content)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YAHOO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yahoo is a web services provider known for its search engine, email services, and news portal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NPR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NPR, or National Public Radio, is a nonprofit media organization that produces and distributes news and cultural programming)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PBS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PBS, or Public Broadcasting Service, is a public broadcaster and television program distributor known for educational and cultural content)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CENTURY COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Century Council is an organization focused on fighting drunk driving and underage drinking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNILEVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unilever is a multinational corporation that produces consumer goods, including personal care products like Dove)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dove is a personal care brand owned by Unilever, known for its \"Campaign for Real Beauty\" which challenges traditional beauty standards)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAMPAIGN FOR REAL BEAUTY<|>EVENT<|>The \"Campaign for Real Beauty\" is a marketing campaign by Dove aimed at redefining beauty standards and promoting self-esteem among women)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAND EFFIE<|>EVENT<|>The Grand Effie is an award recognizing outstanding marketing communications and advertising effectiveness)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANNES INTERNATIONAL ADVERTISING FESTIVAL<|>EVENT<|>The Cannes International Advertising Festival, also known as Cannes Lions, is a global event celebrating creativity in advertising)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNILEVER<|>DOVE<|>Dove is a personal care brand owned by Unilever<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOVE<|>CAMPAIGN FOR REAL BEAUTY<|>Dove launched the \"Campaign for Real Beauty\" to challenge traditional beauty standards<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAMPAIGN FOR REAL BEAUTY<|>GRAND EFFIE<|>The \"Campaign for Real Beauty\" won a Grand Effie award for its effectiveness<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAMPAIGN FOR REAL BEAUTY<|>CANNES INTERNATIONAL ADVERTISING FESTIVAL<|>The \"Campaign for Real Beauty\" was recognized at the Cannes International Advertising Festival<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
