Actually, the ad\nseems to be a bit removed from a straight sales pitch.\nAn educated guess—and that’s what you will be better able to make after reading this\nbook—is that perhaps its objective is simply to make people feel good, to see the goodness\nin a simple patriotic gesture—and, ultimately, to associate that feeling of goodness and\nwarmth with the brand. Does it work? How did you feel when you read over the descrip-\ntion of the ad? Even without seeing the commercial, you may have found that the idea\ntouched your emotions and increased your respect or liking for the brand. To write objec-\ntives, however, you must have some understanding of how these messages work.\nThisbookpresentsbothprinciplesandpracticesofeffectivebrandcommunication.You\nwillfindprinciplesinthemarginsofthetextineverychapter.Inaddition,boxesandother\nfeatureselaborateonboththeprinciplesandpracticesrelatedtothetopicofeachchapter.\nIn this Ninth Edition, we take you behind the scenes of many award-winning cam-\npaigns, such as the “Aflac,” “Altoids,” and “Wii” campaigns, to uncover the hard work and\nexplain the objectives, the inspiration, and the creative ideas behind some great campaigns.\nYou will see how the ideas come together; you will live through the decision making; and\nyou will understand the risks the message creators faced.\nWe also have contributions from highly experienced professionals, as well as our Ad\nStars, graduates from advertising and marketing communication programs around the\ncountry who were nominated by their professors to be featured in this book.
