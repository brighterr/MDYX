They\nargue that further restricting advertising on those products would result in fewer sales and fewer\nhealth problems for America as a whole.\nOpponents of advertising bans counter with the argument that prohibiting truthful, nondecep-\ntive advertising for a legal product is unconstitutional and a violation of their free speech rights. They\nfeel that censorship is more of a problem than advertising a legal product, even if it is unhealthy.\nIn recognition of the growing public concerns about cigarette marketing, tobacco compa-\nnies have voluntarily curbed their advertising and pulled ads from magazines with high levels\nof youth readership and from most outdoor billboards. Most major tobacco companies also run\nanti-smoking ads aimed at teenagers. Philip Morris has virtually stopped advertising and shifted\nSHOWCASE\nTo solve a local crisis in Iceland with its image, Shell used a campaign based on the slogan “Shell—with you all the\nway.” The campaign demonstrated how Shell is involved and “travels” with customers from youth to adulthood,\nfrom work to home, from the present to the future—shaping the society that people want to build.\nThis ad was contributed by Ingvi Logason, principal in HÉR&NÚ, Reykjavik, Iceland. A\ngraduate of Western Florida University, his work was nominated for inclusion in this book\nby Professor Tom Groth.\nCHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY 75\nits budget to events and other promotions that reach its customers, rather than trying to use ad-\nvertising to reach new customers.\nIn 1996 a governmental agency established a set of restrictions applicable to tobacco adver-\ntisers. Among these were a ban on outdoor ads within 1,000 feet of a school or playground and a\nrule that limited ads to black-and-white, text only, in magazines with 55 percent readership under\nthe age of 18. The restrictions also stipulated that $150 million be provided to fund anti-smoking\nads targeting children. Following the 1996 action, most states have received initial payments from\nthe $206 billion master settlement agreement to be supplied by tobacco companies over a 25-year\nperiod. Approximately half the money goes to fund TVand print ads warning children about the\ndangers of smoking; the other half pays for promotions such as loyalty cards, all-expenses-paid\nteen summits, and various events. The anti-smoking truth® campaign aimed at teens was sup-\nported through these efforts.\nBanning tobacco advertising is not unique to the United States. Many other countries have\neven stronger restrictions against such advertising. A near-total advertising ban in the United\nKingdom took effect in early 2003, and similar restrictions were launched in the European Union\ntwo years later. Canada and New Zealand have banned tobacco advertising, and Australia and\nMalaysia have prohibited nearly all forms of it.\nThe ethics of advertising liquor is another concern. The biggest issue for the spirits industry\nis charges of advertising to underage drinkers. In 2003 the FTC became so concerned that it asked\nseveral major liquor producers to detail their marketing practices and target audiences and to ex-\nplain how they had implemented the promises made in a 1999 report to Congress. About the same\ntime a lawsuit filed in the District of Columbia charged that alcohol marketers were actively en-\ngaged in trying to establish brand loyalty among underage consumers.\nLiquor executives contend that they follow voluntary advertising guidelines to avoid images\nand time slots that appeal to kids. That stance has been hard to keep, however, because every ma-\njor brand is trying to win over young consumers.\nThe Distilled Spirits Council, a trade organization representing producers and marketers of\ndistilled spirits sold in the United States, offers a model for industry self-regulation. Its Code of\nResponsible Practices for Beverage Alcohol Advertising and Marketing encourages members to\nfollow the guidelines set forth in the code when promoting their products.\nFor many years companies themselves and the four biggest networks—ABC, NBC, CBS,\nand Fox—imposed a voluntary restriction on television advertising for liquor. However, in No-\nvember 1996 the voluntary ban was dropped by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States,\nafter Seagram’s ran a commercial on an ABC affiliate. Commercials for distilled spirits are in-\ncreasingly visible on television.23\nThe beer industry has been the target of strong criticism for several years. Although it is un-\nlikely that beer advertising will be banned, some companies sensitive to public opinion have ini-\ntiated proactive programs that educate and discourage underage drinkers.\nPrescription drugs are another problem area. In 1997, the government loosened its controls\non pharmaceutical advertising. As a result, the amount of prescription drug advertising has sky-\nrocketed. While these print and TVads have proven very successful in terms of increased sales,\nvarious consumer groups, government agencies, and insurance companies have been quite criti-\ncal of them. In one study, for example, the National Institute of Health Care Management found\nthat direct-to-consumer prescription advertising has led to an increase in requests for costlier\ndrugs, when the less expensive generic drug would be just as effective.24\nAlso, some doctors claim that they are being pressured to write inappropriate prescriptions\nbecause their patients are influenced by the drug ad claims. Other doctors say they appreciate that\nthe advertising has caused consumers to become more active in managing their own health and\nmore informed about their drug options.\nInrecenthealthcarereformefforts,somelawmakerstargetedthe$4.3billionadsectorforelim-\nination because they believe these ads contribute to the high cost of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PHILIP MORRIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Philip Morris is a major tobacco company that has reduced its advertising efforts and shifted its budget to events and promotions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Shell is a multinational oil company that ran a campaign in Iceland to improve its image, using the slogan 'Shell—with you all the way'\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INGVI LOGASON<|>PERSON<|>Ingvi Logason is a principal in HÉR&NÚ, Reykjavik, Iceland, and a graduate of Western Florida University, known for contributing an ad to a book)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOM GROTH<|>PERSON<|>Tom Groth is a professor who nominated Ingvi Logason's work for inclusion in a book)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISTILLED SPIRITS COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Distilled Spirits Council is a trade organization representing producers and marketers of distilled spirits in the United States, promoting self-regulation in advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEAGRAM'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Seagram's is a company that ran a commercial on an ABC affiliate, leading to the lifting of a voluntary ban on liquor advertising by the Distilled Spirits Council)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Institute of Health Care Management conducted a study on the impact of direct-to-consumer prescription advertising)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHILIP MORRIS<|>TOBACCO COMPANIES<|>Philip Morris is one of the major tobacco companies that have voluntarily curbed advertising<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHELL<|>INGVI LOGASON<|>Ingvi Logason contributed an ad for Shell's campaign in Iceland<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INGVI LOGASON<|>TOM GROTH<|>Tom Groth nominated Ingvi Logason's work for inclusion in a book<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DISTILLED SPIRITS COUNCIL<|>SEAGRAM'S<|>Seagram's commercial led to the Distilled Spirits Council lifting a voluntary ban on liquor advertising<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT<|>PRESCRIPTION DRUG ADVERTISING<|>The National Institute of Health Care Management studied the effects of prescription drug advertising<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
