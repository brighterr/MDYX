In other words, marketers want to know which, if any, competing brands\nhave louder voices (i.e., are spending more) than they do. For example, if the total spent on\nairline advertising last year was $200 million, and $50 million of that was spent by United\nAirlines, UA’s share of voice would be 25 percent (50 (cid:6)200(cid:4)25%). Most agencies rec-\nommend that a brand’s share of voice be at least as high as its share of market. For a new\nbrand, obviously its share of voice needs to be more than its share of market if it wants to\ngrow.\n• MediaKitsThevariousmediaandtheirrespectivemediavehiclesprovidemediakits,\nwhichcontaininformationaboutthesizeandmakeupoftheiraudiences.Althoughmedia-\nsuppliedinformationisuseful,keepinmindthatthisisan“insidejob”—thatis,theinfor-\nmationisassembledtomakethebestpossiblecaseforadvertisinginthatparticularmedium\nandmediavehicle.Forthatreason,outsideresearchsources,suchasmediarepcompanies\nandtheNielsenreports,arealsoused.Asdiscussedinpreviouschapters,NielsenMediaRe-\nsearchauditsnationalandlocaltelevision,andArbitronmeasuresradio.Otherservices,\nsuchastheAuditingBureauofCirculations(ABC),Simmons,andMRImonitorprintaudi-\nences,andMediaMetrixmeasuresInternetaudiences.Allofthesecom\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MEDIAMARK RESEARCH INC.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mediamark Research Inc. is a company that provides market research services, including information on product categories, brands, advertising expenditures, and customer lifestyle characteristics<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED AIRLINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>United Airlines is an airline company that spent $50 million on advertising last year, representing a 25% share of voice in the airline advertising market<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NIELSEN MEDIA RESEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nielsen Media Research is a company that audits national and local television<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARBITRON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Arbitron is a company that measures radio audiences<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUDITING BUREAU OF CIRCULATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Auditing Bureau of Circulations is an organization that monitors print audiences<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMMONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Simmons is a service that monitors print audiences<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDIAMETRIX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MediaMetrix is a service that measures Internet audiences<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED AIRLINES<|>MEDIAMARK RESEARCH INC.<|>United Airlines' advertising expenditure data is likely included in Mediamark Research Inc.'s market research services<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NIELSEN MEDIA RESEARCH<|>MEDIAMARK RESEARCH INC.<|>Nielsen Media Research provides data that could be used by Mediamark Research Inc. for television audience insights<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARBITRON<|>MEDIAMARK RESEARCH INC.<|>Arbitron provides radio audience data that could be used by Mediamark Research Inc.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUDITING BUREAU OF CIRCULATIONS<|>MEDIAMARK RESEARCH INC.<|>The Auditing Bureau of Circulations provides print audience data that could be used by Mediamark Research Inc.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMMONS<|>MEDIAMARK RESEARCH INC.<|>Simmons provides print audience data that could be used by Mediamark Research Inc.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEDIAMETRIX<|>MEDIAMARK RESEARCH INC.<|>MediaMetrix provides Internet audience data that could be used by Mediamark Research Inc.<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
