The most important metric for\nInternet advertising, however, is conversion rate,\nwhich is the percentage of visitors to a site who com-\nplete a desired action, such as playing a game, sign-\ning up for a newsletter, or buying something.

It gives a more comprehensive pic-\nture of the path visitors and customers use in navi-\ngating a site.\nForrester Research has been developing methods for evaluating websites for years. The\ncompany tracks effectiveness of website performance in terms not only of making a brand prom-\nise, but in terms of also delivering easy-to-find and use information. Harley Manning, a Forrester\nvice president, reported that his company’s research has found that “on average sites did a better\njob of making the brand promise than they did of meeting customer needs.” Manning explains\nhow this research is used to evaluate good and bad performing websites in The Inside Story.\n(Check Forrester’s website at www.forrester.com.)\nSpecial Advertising Situations\nThe various types of advertising identified in Chapter 18are evaluated using many of the tools\ndiscussed previously; however, they each have their own particular objectives that affect how\nthey are evaluated.\nThe primary objective of retail advertisingis to generate store traffic. The results of traffic-\nbuilding promotions and advertising are simple counts of transactions as well as the change in\nsales volume of brands receiving promotional support. Participation counts can be used to esti-\nmate the pull of special events. Loyalty is evidenced through participation in frequent buyer pro-\ngrams and measured in terms of registration, store visits, and average purchases per visit.\nInB2Bmarketing,acommonformofevaluationisacountofsalesleadsbasedonresponse\ndevicessuchascalls,e-mails,andcardsreturnedtotheadvertiser.AnothercommonB2Bobjective\nisconversion,similartotheconversionrateintheonlinediscussion;thisreferstothenumberof\nleadsthatturnintocustomerswhomakeapurchase.Conversionrates,whicharepercentagesofthe\nleads,arealsocalculatedformostmarketingcommunicationtoolsusedinsupportofB2Bprograms.\n)srallod\nfo\nsdnasuoht\nni(\nselaS\nTotal revenue\n70\nProfit\nTotal costs\n60\nBreak-even point\n(30,000 premiums\ndelivered at a cost\n50 of $45,000)\n40 Variable costs\n30\n20 Fixed costs\nLoss\n10\n10 20 30 40 50\nFIGURE 19.4\nA Sales Promotion Break-Even Analysis\nAt the break-even point, where 30,000 premiums are delivered at a cost of $45,000,\nthe sales revenues exactly cover, but do not exceed, total costs.
