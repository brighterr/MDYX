This is typical of some discount store ads or ads for local retailers,\nsuch as tire companies.\n• NonlinearThis contemporary style of layout can be read starting at any point in the image. In\nother words, the direction of viewing is not ordered, as in the “What a Ride” ad for Schwinn.\nThis style of ad layout works for young people who are more accustomed to nonlinear forms.\nThis ad for Schwinn bicycles uses a plumbing drain motif to convey the industrial-strength\nfeatures of the bike. It is a nonlinear design in that it doesn’t matter where you start reading\nand what you read next. The text is carried in callouts that point to different visual elements in\nthe layout.\n304 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nLayout Stages The stages in the normal development of a print ad may vary from agency to\nagency or from client to client. Figure 10.2shows the six-stage development of an Orly nail polish\nad. This ad went through thumbnail sketches, which are quick, miniature preliminary sketches;\nrough layouts,which show where design elements go; semicompsandcomprehensives,which are\ndrawn to size and used for presentation either in house or to the client; and mechanicals,which as-\nsemble the elements in their final position for reproduction. The final product that is used for actual\nproduction of the ad is a high-resolution computer file.\nComposition\nWe’ve been talking about layout, which is a term used to describe how the elements in print (head-\nline, art, tagline, etc.) are arranged. Compositionrefers to the way the elements in a picture are\n(A) (B) (C)\n(D) (E) (F)\nFIGURE 10.2\nOrly “Chantilly Peach” Creative Process\n(A) Thumbnail SketchesThese ideas for Orly were developed by the creative team late at night over Diet Coke and\nChinese chicken salad. (B) Rough LayoutTransitioning to legs and painted toenails, the layout begins to give some\nglamour and personality to the product. (C) SemicompsType, color, and tagline are still not finalized, but layout is\nmore complete. (D) ComprehensivesTagline approved. The illustrator has added more glitz to the layout. (E) Me-\nchanicalsThe digital file before retouching. Client still made small changes at this stage, but had approved the ad’s lay-\nout and copy. (F) Final High-Resolution FilmThe film house had to retouch, creating separate files for the legs and\nbackground image so that the proportion of the leg illustration would be correct.\nCHAPTER 10 • VISUAL COMMUNICATION 305\narranged (think a still-life painting) or framed through a camera lens (think a landscape photo or\nmovie scene).Photographers and videographers(people who shoot a scene using a video cam-\nera) handle composition in two ways: (1) they may be able to place or arrange the elements in\nfront of their cameras and (2) they may have to compose the image by manipulating their own\npoint of view if the elements can’t be moved. In other words, they move around to find the most\naesthetic way to frame an image that isn’t movable, such as a scene or landscape, as well as to\ncatch different lighting situations, such as bright sun and shade or shadow.\nSimilar to the way layouts are developed by using sketches, video images are also drawn and\npresented as storyboards,which are sketches of the scenes and key shots in a commercial. The art\ndirector imagines the characters and setting as well as how the characters act and move in the scene.\nThe art director sketches in a few key frames the visual idea for a scene and how it is to be shot\nand how one scene links to the scenes that follow. In addition, the storyboard sketches also reflect\nthe position and movement of the cameras recording the scene, a description of which is spelled\nout both in the script and on the storyboard. The “Coffee Ambush” storyboard details the action in\na commercial for McDonald’s new McCafé line of specialty coffees. We’ll explain more about the\ncommercial in the production section that follows.\nWHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW\nABOUT PRODUCTION?\nArt directors need to understand print media requirements and the technical side\nof production because these factors affect both the look of the printed piece and its\ncost. Marketing communication managers also need to understand some of these\nbasics in order to critique ideas and evaluate them in terms of cost and feasibility.\nPrint Media Requirements\nDifferentmediaputdifferentdemandsonthedesignandproductionofadver-\ntising.Newspapersanddirectories,forexample,areprintedathighspeedon\nan inexpensive, rough-surfaced, spongy paper called newsprint that quickly\nabsorbs ink on contact.
