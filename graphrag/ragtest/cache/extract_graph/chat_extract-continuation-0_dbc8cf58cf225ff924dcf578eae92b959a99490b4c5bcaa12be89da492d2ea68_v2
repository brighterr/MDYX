Insight research, in other words,\ndesigned to uncover the is basically about asking and listening, and then asking more questions to probe deeper into\nwhys of the buys, as well thoughts, opinions, attitudes, desires, and motivations.\nas the why nots. Researchers often try to uncover the whys of the buys,but insight research may also uncover\nreasons why people don’t want to try or buy a product. For example, Dunkin’Donuts found in its\nconsumer research several reasons why its customers were uncomfortable ordering fancy coffee\ndrinks. Mostly they were intimidated by the whole “barista” thing and the fancy coffee names.\nThe DDB agency regularly conducts “Barriers to Purchase” research5realizing that these\nbarriers often create an opportunity for advertising messages to present information or change\nperceptions. The American Dairy Association, for example, asked DDB to find out why cheese\nconsumption was declining. A study identified one barrier that was most easily correctable\nthrough a marketing communication effort: the absence of simple cheese recipes for home\ncooks. Ads and the association’s website (www.ilovecheese.com) offer many such recipes.\nEmotions are elicited by asking consumers what they think people in various photos and sit-\nuations are feeling. Associations are investigated by asking people what comes to mind when a\nword or brand is mentioned. In association tests,people are asked what they think of when they\nhear a cue, such as the name of a product category or a brand. They respond with all of the things\nthat come to mind, and, as we have said, that forms a network of associations.Brand perceptions\nare tested this way to map the structure and logic of these association networks, which lead to\nmessage strategies. For example, what do you think of when you think of Taco Bell? Wendy’s?\nArby’s? Each restaurant should bring to mind some\nthings in common (fast food, cheap food), but they also\nhave distinct networks of associations based on type of\nfood (Mexican, hamburgers, roast beef), restaurant de-\nsign, logo and colors, brand characters, healthfulness,\nand so forth. Each restaurant, then, has a distinctive\nprofile that can be determined from this network of as-\nsociations.\nTogetinsideconsumers’mindstoseewhatthey\narereallythinking,marketershaveturnedtothetools\nof neuroscience, which uses highly technical equip-\nmenttoscanthebrainasitprocessesinformationand\nmakes decisions.
