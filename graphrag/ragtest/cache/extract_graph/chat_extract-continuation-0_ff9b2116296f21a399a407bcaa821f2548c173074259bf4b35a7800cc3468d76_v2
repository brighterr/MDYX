Other doctors say they appreciate that\nthe advertising has caused consumers to become more active in managing their own health and\nmore informed about their drug options.\nInrecenthealthcarereformefforts,somelawmakerstargetedthe$4.3billionadsectorforelim-\nination because they believe these ads contribute to the high cost of health care.25 Whether this\nwillevermaterializeisupintheair.Inthemeantime,thisadvertisingislegal.Forguidelinesper-\ntaining to advertising prescription drugs, see the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration’s website:\nwww.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/PrescriptionDrugAdvertising/default.htm.\nEmerging Issues One study surveyed industry leaders to see if they thought ethical issues\nchanged over time.26Their answer: Traditional ethical issues, such as the importance of being hon-\nest and respectful in communication, are essentially the same, but different ones are emerging as\n76 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\na result of the changing digital media landscape. Industry leaders explained the risk of not telling\nthe truth was low in traditional media because so many checks and balances exist in the forms of\nlaws, guidelines, and other policing mechanisms. The checks and balances related to the Internet\nand blogosphere, however, aren’t as well established, and a consensus about what constitutes eth-\nical behavior hasn’t fully developed for the Web.\nAlso marketers’loss of control over their messages, transparency, and privacy on the Inter-\nnet are key factors relating to ethical practices. The leaders noted the difficulty and complexity\nrelated to developing regulation and controls for digital media practices like blogola and paid vi-\nral marketing. Photographers complain when their images are taken from sites like Flickr and\nused in ads without their permission. It’s particularly a problem with user-generated ads.\nSocial Responsibility,Branding,and Integrity There is even an IMC dimension to social respon-\nsibility. Cause marketing,which is marketing that supports a good cause such as Habitat for Hu-\nmanity, is a common practice for many companies. Companies can send employee teams to work\non food banks or homeless shelters, or the company can donate money or sponsor fund-raisers—\nbut those efforts are often short term.\nOn a higher level of social responsibility is the use of mission marketing,which refers to\nmarketing that aligns the basic business practices and position of a brand with some cause such\nas the environment or sustainability. This practice adds value to a brand and leads to a positive\nbrand perception, as well as brand loyalty and stakeholder commitment. Ben & Jerry’s, Tom’s of\nMaine, and the Body Shop are all supporters of good environmental practices in sourcing their\ningredients. Starbucks has become a supporter of ethically grown and traded coffee beans through\nits “Shared Planet” program. In other words, it’s more than a short-term support of a cause—these\ncommitments are deeply embedded in the essence and operations of the brand and they lead to a\nmore passionate brand loyalty from all their stakeholders.\nMission marketing demonstrates our Fourth Principle of IMC:Integration equals integrity.\nFourth Principle\nYou may not know this, but the Latin for both integrationandintegritycome from the same root\nof IMC\nwords,integrare,“to make whole,” and integritas,“wholeness.” In IMC, when brand communi-\nIntegration equals\ncation is managed as a whole (i.e., when all of the pieces and parts work together), then it achieves\nintegrity.\nintegrity. Abrand with integrity is driven by a singular vision and that can, and should, include\ngood citizenship.\nGreen marketing,for example, is more than just an advertising theme that resonates as con-\nsumers become concerned about questions of global warming. It can also drive business decisions\nand impact product design and packaging for everything from diapers to cars to plastic water bot-\ntles. Companies concerned with this issue calculate the pollution created by their products—in\nmanufacturing, use, and disposal. Walmart, for example, announced in 2009 that it would provide\nenvironmental impact information for all of its products.27\nWHAT ARE COMMUNICATORS’ ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES?\nBynowyouarefamiliarwithmanyoftheethicalandsocialissuesfacingmarketingcommu-\nnication.Howdoesthisinvolveyou?Thissectionwillgiveyouabetterunderstandingabout\nwhat we mean by ethics and provide some decision-making tools as you encounter ethical\ndilemmas. Let’s start by considering a Benetton campaign that challenged personal and pro-\nfessionalethics.\nEthicsare the “shoulds” and “oughts” of behavior. Ethics are the “right thing to do.” Defin-\ning what is right can be challenging. What one person says is right isn’t always what others define\nto be appropriate. Ethics and morals are closely related, but they are not synonymous. Moralsare\nframeworks for right actions and are more the domain of religion and philosophy. Examples of\nmoral systems are the Ten Commandments from the Judeo-Christian religious tradition or the\nBuddhists’Eightfold Path. These moral systems provide a framework for behavior.\nAlthough ethics reflect what is right and wrong, the difficulty lies in making choices from\nequally compelling or competing options, as in the Benetton example—how should you behave\nwhen the answer is unclear? We know that doing the right thing is ethical, but it’s sometimes hard\nto know what the right thing is. Sometimes there’s no one right answer.
