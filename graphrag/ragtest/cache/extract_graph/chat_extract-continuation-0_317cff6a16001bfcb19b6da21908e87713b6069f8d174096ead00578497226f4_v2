The more similar the product to which they responded is to the\nmarketer’s product, the more valuable the list because these people should be similar to the\ncompany’s current customers. For example, if you sell pet food, you might like a list of peo-\nple who have responded to a magazine ad for a pet identification collar. Two important crite-\nria are obvious from such a list: these people very likely have a pet, and they are open to\nbuying from a catalog, mail offer, or website.\n• Acompiled listis a list of some specific category, such as sports car owners, new home\nbuyers, graduating seniors, new mothers, association members, or subscribers to a magazine,\nbook club, or record club. Luxury car manufacturers are always interested in lists of people\nwho belong to country clubs, own a yacht, or own luxury cars, because these people obvi-\nously like and can afford such luxuries.\nNew lists can be created by merging and purging. If you want to target older women in New\nEngland who play tennis, for example, most list houses would be able to put together a database\nfor you by combining lists, called merging,and then deleting the repeated names, called purging.\nThis is a postcard mailed to B2B direct marketers offering lists classified into\n47 different types of buying characteristics. It separates prospects in terms of\n47 “buying influence selectors” that include such factors as job function, industry,\nand decision-making patterns.\n508 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nFor example, you may want to develop a list of people who are in the market for fine furniture in\nyour city. You could buy a list of new home buyers and combine that with a list of people who live\nin a desirable census tract. These two lists together—a compiled list—would let you find people\nwho have bought new homes in upscale neighborhoods.\nAcompanycanhiredatabasemanagementfirmswhosesolepurposeistocollect,analyze,\ncategorize, and market an enormous variety of detail about customers.

This kind of information is valuable to marketers, resellers, and their agencies. It’s also of\nconcern to consumer activists and consumers who worryabout privacy.\nNintendo uses the 2 million names in its database when it introduces more powerful versions\nof its video game system. The names and addresses are gathered from a list of subscribers to its\nmagazine,Nintendo Power.The company believes that many of its current customers will want\nto trade up systems, and this direct communication makes it possible for Nintendo to speak di-\nrectly to its most important target market about new systems as they become available. Nintendo\nbegan its database in 1988 and credits database marketing with helping it maintain its huge share\nof the $6 billion to $7 billion video game market.\nData Mining The practice of sifting through and sorting information captured in a company’s\ndatabase to target customers and maintain a relationship with them is called data mining.18Such\ninformation includes comprehensive profiles based on demographics, lifestyle, and behavior, as\nwell as basic contact information.\nThe Melissa DATA\nwebsite explains the\nservices offered by this\ncompany in database\ncollection and\nmaintenance.\nCHAPTER 16 • DIRECT RESPONSE 509\nHow is data mining used? Marketers collect information about their cus-\ntomers to better target customers who might really be interested in their offers.\nThis is called behavioral targeting,to which we referred in Chapter 5. Instead of\nsending mass e-mails (spam) to everyone on a list, marketers can send informa-\ntion to people who are really interested in their product or service based on their\npast purchases and other product-related actions.\nData mining is also used to spot trends and patterns—frequent flyers may\nalso be buyers of international phone cards, for example. Using the practice dis-\ncussed earlier called prospecting,data mining also can be used to profile prospects\nbased on key characteristics of current customers. If a grocery store that uses a\nloyalty card to track its customers’purchases notices that the young families in\nits customer pool live in certain neighborhoods, then it can target family-oriented\npromotions to those particular neighborhoods rather than spraying them across its\nentire geographical market.\nLike the recycling\nThe Privacy Issue Privacy is a huge concern for all direct marketers, not just those engaged in symbol, this “i” will\ne-commerce.
