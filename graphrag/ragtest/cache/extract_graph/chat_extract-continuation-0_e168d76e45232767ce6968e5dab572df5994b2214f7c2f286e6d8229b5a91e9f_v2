In other words, whenever a call is made, for whatever purpose, that contact provides\nan opportunity to ask a brand-related question. Marketers also monitor blogs, chat rooms, and so-\ncial media (Facebook, MySpace, Twitter) for clues about what people are saying about a brand.\nAn example of a structured feedback program comes from Nordstrom’s Personal Touch Pro-\ngram, which uses a team of personal shopperswho are fashion consultants on one level but on\nanother level are trained to gather information from their clients to feed back into the company’s\nbusiness planning and marketing.\nLooking Ahead\nResearch, analysis, and new techniques such as crowdsourcing, lead to marketing communica-\ntion plans and strategic decisions, which will be the topic of the next chapter. The research find-\nings also lead to message strategies, which we introduce in Part 3, and media strategies, which\nwill follow in Part 4.\nCHAPTER 6 • STRATEGIC RESEARCH 185\nIT’S A WRAP\nComfort Food for Thought\nCheetos’ research shifted the focus of its strategy from kids to “rejuvenile” adults as a target audience. Key\ninsights from research efforts shaped the creative direction to create edgy humor that spoke to those cur-\nrent and would-be Cheetos lovers. The message became “It’s all about fun”—and that appealed to a certain\nsegment of the adult audience, who just happened to be fans of Cheetos.\nConsultant Howard Papush, aka Dr. Play, said, “When we’re stressed, we revert back to the things that\ncomforted us as kids. We want to play our way through stress.” It seems to be a universal truth, at least for\nsome of us, that comfort food, aka Cheetos, can occasionally be a good way to relieve stress. And orange fin-\ngers are fun.\nInterestingly, little in the campaign speaks about the product. Yet, the campaign seems to succeed,\nmaybe because the audience it seeks rejects a direct push about the product. Besides, who doesn’t know\nwhat Cheetos are? Did the campaign work to accomplish the objective of repositioning the brand for a new\ntarget market? Several indicators suggest the success of the Cheetos campaign.\nFirst, and most importantly, Cheetos’ sales rose significantly, almost doubling the targeted rate. In a track-\ning study about the best-regarded snack brands, Cheetos improved from 41st position to 34th, and this im-\nprovement was mainly from households without children.\nThe repositioning strategy created energy for the brand by connecting the message that this snack could\nhelp consumers lighten up with its audience in a variety of traditional and digital media. Disregarding your\nmother’s admonition not to play with your food, this campaign tells you it’s okay in ways that speak effectively\nto the target audience. The new Cheetos campaign created more than mischievous fun. It made award-winning\nadvertising communication. In 2009 the Advertising Research Foundation awarded this campaign its best of\nshow, the Grand Ogilvy Winner.\nKey Points Summary\n1.What are the basic types of strategic research and how responses from consumers about their attitudes and behav-\nare they used?Secondary research is background research iors.
