Developed by the\nBoston University AdLab group, this billboard illustrates a message delivered at the right time and the right place.\nACDI is calculated for product categories.

Planners typically don’t make heavy allocations in weak sales areas unless\nstrong marketing signals indicate significant growth potential. Conversely, strong sales markets\nmay not receive proportional increases in advertising unless clear evidence suggests that com-\npany sales can go much higher with greater advertising investment. When there is a lot of com-\npetitive activity, a heavy-up strategy may be used to defend the brand’s market share.\nScheduling Strategies When should a potential customer be exposed to a brand message?\nScheduling strategies are designed to identify the best times for consumers to come in contact\nwith a brand message.\nFor many product categories, prospective customers have one or more ideal times or places\nPrinciple\nat which they are most receptive to receiving and paying attention to a brand message.

If advertising budgets were unlimited, most companies would advertise\nevery day. Not even the largest advertisers are in this position, so media planners manipulate\nschedules in various ways to create the strongest possible impact given the budget. Three sched-\nuling strategies involve timing, duration of exposure, and continuity of exposure.\n• Timing Strategies:When to Advertise?Timing decisions relate to factors such as seasonal-\nity, holidays, days of the week, and time of day. These decisions are driven by how often the\nproduct is bought and whether it is used more in some months than in others. Timing also\nencompasses the consumers’best aperture and competitors’advertising schedules. Another\nconsideration is lead time,or the amount of time allowed before the beginning of the sales\nperiod to reach people when they are just beginning to think about seasonal buying. Back-to-\nschool advertising is an example. Advertising typically starts in July or early August for a\n434 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nschool calendar that begins in late August or September. Lead time also refers to the produc-\ntion time needed to get the advertisement into the medium. There is a long lead time for\nmagazines, but it is shorter for local media, such as newspapers and radio.\n• Duration:How Long?For how many weeks or months of the year should the advertising run?\nIf there is a need to cover most of the weeks, advertising will be spread rather thin. If the\namount of time to cover is limited, advertising can be concentrated more heavily. Message\nscheduling is driven by use cycles. For products that are consumed year-round, such as fast food\nand movies, advertising is spread throughout the year. In general, if you cannot cover the whole\nyear, you should heavy up the schedule in higher purchase periods.
