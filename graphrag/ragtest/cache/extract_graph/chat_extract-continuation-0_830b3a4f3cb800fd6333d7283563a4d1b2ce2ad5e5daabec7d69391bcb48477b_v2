Fulfillment includes all of the back-end activities of processing the transaction, including\ndelivering the product, receiving payment, and providing customers with tracking numbers so\nthey can trace the delivery of their orders. The most critical aspect of successful direct marketing,\nhowever, is maintaining a customer relationship.\nRelationship Building Direct marketers use a database to track customer interactions and trans-\nactions, the final step in Figure 16.2. Measuring and evaluating consumer behavior helps the\ndirect marketer understand not only how the customers have responded to direct marketing mes-\nPrinciple\nsages but predict their future behavior and build a relationship.\nBecause direct marketing\nDirect marketing (DM) is not a “shot-in-the-dark” approach.

Because of this constant evaluation,\nCHAPTER 16 • DIRECT RESPONSE 495\nthere is an emphasis in DM on learning what is most effective and employing that information\nin succeeding efforts. Such accurate measurements and adjustments are largely responsible for\nDMC’s success.\nWHAT ARE THE PRIMARY MEDIA OF DMC?\nPersonal sales is the original and most effective—and also most expensive—form of direct mar-\nketing. Sales persons are found in stores, they knock on the doors of homes, and they also make\ncalls on business prospects. Personal sales are also a part of home parties, which are sponsored\nby such companies as Mary Kay and Weekenders.\nAvon, which was named ninth on a list of “The Ten Most Successful Brands of 2010,” is one\nof the biggest direct sales companies with its millions of sales representatives and some $11 mil-\nlion in revenue.1Anew Avon little sister brand is Mark, a college program for direct sales on cam-\npus. The Mark college co-eds roam dormitories and sorority houses selling Mark beauty products\nand fashion accessories. In early 2010, there were more than 40,000 Mark Girls signed up in\nNorth America. The new organization combines personal sales with an e-boutique, iPhone app,\nand Facebook e-shop.2\nBeyond personal sales, direct marketing employs five primary tools to achieve its objectives:\n(1) direct mail, (2) catalogs, (3) telemarketing, (4) direct-response advertising, and (5) online\ne-marketing. What is typical of all of these forms is that they offer an opportunity for in-depth in-\nformation. Copywriter and professor, Karen Mallia, who wrote the Part III opener, observes that\n“direct marketers have known for years that people considering expensive or complex products\nwant information, and people will be persuaded when that information is delivered in copy that\nsells while it tells. Much Internet advertising is simply direct marketing in electronic form: e-mails\nare just another kind of “letter,” and search-engine advertising is direct copy at its tightest.”\nDirect Mail\nOfthoseorganizationsthatusedirectmarketing,directmailisthemostpopularmethod.Anyone\nwithamailingaddresshasreceiveddirectmail.Advertisingmailrepresentedmorethan63per-\ncentofallmailreceivedbyhouseholds,accordingtotheU.S.PostalService’sHouseholdDiary\nStudy.3\nAdirect-mail piece is a print advertising message for a product or service that is delivered\nby mail. It may be as simple as a single-page letter or as complex as a three-dimensional package\nconsisting of a letter, a brochure, a sample, a premium, and an order card with a return envelope.\nWith the advances in digital printing, it is now possible to personalize not only the address and\nsalutation on the letter but also other parts of the information as well as the offer. Called variable\ndata campaigns,these marketing messages can be highly targeted, even unique to the recipient.\nKodak’s NexPress Digital Production Color Press is specifically designed for this application.\nThe following guidelines can be helpful for putting together direct-mail pieces:\n• Get the attention of the targeted prospect as the envelope comes from the mailbox.\n• Create a need for the product, show what it looks like, and demonstrate how it is used.\n• Answer questions, as a good salesperson does, and reassure the buyer.\n• Provide critical information about product use.\n• Inspire confidence, minimize risk, and establish that the company is reputable.\n• Make the sale by explaining how to buy, how to order, where to call, and how to pay for the\npurchase.\n• Use an incentive to encourage a fast response.\nMost direct mail is sent using a third-class bulk mail permit, which requires a minimum of\n200 identical pieces. Third class is cheaper than first class, but it takes longer for delivery. Esti-\nmates of nondelivery of third-class mail run as high as 8 percent. The response rate for direct mail\ncan vary from 0.1 to 50 percent, but it’s typically in the 2 to 3 percent range. The primary vari-\nables are the offer and target audience. Offers mailed to current customers generally have a higher\nresponse rate than those sent to noncustomers.\n496 PART 5 • PRINC\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AVON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Avon is one of the biggest direct sales companies with millions of sales representatives and significant revenue, known for its direct marketing strategies and personal sales approach)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mark is a college program and a little sister brand of Avon, focusing on direct sales on campus with a combination of personal sales and digital platforms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KAREN MALLIA<|>PERSON<|>Karen Mallia is a copywriter and professor who provides insights into direct marketing strategies, emphasizing the importance of informative and persuasive copy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KODAK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kodak is a company known for its NexPress Digital Production Color Press, which is used for variable data campaigns in direct mail marketing)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AVON<|>MARK<|>Mark is a little sister brand of Avon, focusing on direct sales on college campuses<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAREN MALLIA<|>DIRECT MARKETING<|>Karen Mallia provides insights into the effectiveness of direct marketing strategies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KODAK<|>DIRECT MAIL<|>Kodak's NexPress is used for creating personalized direct mail pieces<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
