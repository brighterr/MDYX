Advertisers are\nparticularly interested in the role of peers in influencing their outer-directed friends’wants and\ndesires. On the other hand, inner-directed people are more likely to try new things first.\nFamily The family is the most important reference group for many people because of its for-\nmative role and the intensity of its relationships. Other reference groups, such as peers, cowork-\ners, and neighbors, tend to change as we age. According to the U.S. Census definition, a family\nconsists of two or more people who are related by blood, marriage, or adoption and live in the\nsame household. Ahouseholddiffers from a family in that it consists of all those who occupy a\ndwelling whether they are related or not. The family is responsible for raising children and es-\ntablishing a lifestyle for family members. Lifestylereflects family situation, values, and income.\nIt determines the way people spend their time and money and the kinds of activities they value.\nIn the 21st century—for the first time in U.S. history—one-person households outnumber\nmarried couples with children. This reflects a growing trend in America during the past 30 years\nto marry later in life, divorce, or never get married at all. Marketers and their advertisers have\nbeen right on top of this trend. Banks have created special mortgages, builders are providing\nhomes and apartments to meet the needs of single occupants, and food marketers have introduced\n“single” portions.\nPsychological Influences\nWe have analyzed cultural and social influenceson consumer behavior. Now let’s look at the\npersonal characteristics that affect how you respond as an individual. The psychological factors\nof interest to advertisers include state of mind, needs and wants, motivations, as well as attitudes,\npersonality, and thoughts and thinking patterns.\nPerceptionandStateofMind Yourstateofmindaffectsthewayyouperceiveinformation.Your\npastexperienceswithabrand,aswellaswhatyourfriendssayaboutit,cancoloryourfeelings\nandmakeyoumoreorlessreceptivetoabrandmessage.Othermentalstates—suchasanger,fa-\ntigue,hunger,excitement,orlethargy—canalsoaffectyourbehaviorbecausetheycreateinternal\nnoisethatgetsinthewayofyourreceptionofamessageorprovidetheimpetustodriveyouto\nbuysomething.\nNeeds and Wants In Chapter 4, we described needs and wants as two different types of re-\nsponses that lead to different reactions to an advertising message. The basic driving forces that\nmotivate us to do something that reflect basic survival, such as choose a motel (shelter) or restau-\nrant (food) when traveling, are called needs. Primary needs(biological) include the need for wa-\nter, food, air, and shelter. In the case of the needs pyramid developed by psychologist Abraham\nMaslow (see Figure 5.2), these are called physiological and safety needs.\nNeeds we learn in response to our culture and environment are called acquired needs.These\nmay include the need for esteem, prestige, affection, power, learning, and, yes, beauty. Because\nacquired needs are not necessary to your physical survival, they are also called secondary needs.\nMaslow called them social (belonging),egoistic,andself-actualization.The Old Navy campaign,\nwith its moderate-priced fashion line, builds demand for products that address acquired needs.\nAwant occurs when we desire or wish for something—we won’t die if we don’t get it, but\nit can still provide a strong motivation to try or buy something new. This is particularly true in\nfashion areas, such as clothing and music. Research has uncovered the power of new and novel.\nAs account planner Susan Mendelsohn explains, “In some cases, we want things just for the sheer\nfun of newness—think about how many pairs of shoes or the amount of clothes people have.”4\nDesire is the driving force behind demand and successful brands focus more on what we\nwant than on what we need. Brian Martin, the founder of Brand Connections, has built a list of\n10 desires that successful brands satisfy:5\n1. To feel safe and secure\n2. To feel comfortable\n136 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nRevelant Products Example\nSELF-\nACTUALIZATION\nSelf-Fulfillment Hallmark– \"When you care enough\nHobbies, travel, education Enriching Experiences tosend the very best.\"\nEGO NEEDS\nCars, furniture, credit cards, Prestige, Status,\nstores, country clubs, liquors Accomplishments Diesel– \"For Successful Living.\"\nBELONGINGNESS\nClothing, grooming products, Love, Friendship, USO– \"Until Everyone\nclubs, drinks Acceptance by Others Comes Home.\"\nInsurance, alarm systems, SAFETY Firestone– \"Check\nretirement, investments Security, Shelter, Protection Your Tires.\"\nNyquil– \"The sniffling,sneezing,\nMedicines,staple PHYSIOLOGICAL\nstuffy head, fever...so you can\nitems, generics Water, Sleep, Food\nrest medicine.\"\nFIGURE 5.2\nMaslow’s Hierarchy\nof Needs 3.
