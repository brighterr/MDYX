The company is also su-\ning a San Francisco company that runs a look-alike, “parasite” site called Craigsup. Other legal\nissues focus on its adult category, which carries explicit sexual-service ads.28\nInternet Ad Sales The market for online display ads was estimated at $21 billion a year in 2009.\nGoogle has been the most successful at attracting advertising, even during the recession, although\nYahoo! draws more traffic.29Google also dominates the search ad industry and sells display ads,\nalong with search ads, for thousands of sites.\nSelling online advertising space is complicated. Major sites, such as MSNB.com and\nHistory.com, sell ads on their pages charging premium prices because they are on high-traffic\nsites. They can cost from $10 to $50 per thousand viewings depending on the visibility of the\nposition.30Advertisers and their media buyers get access to Internet sites through providers such\nas DoubleClick, an Internet advertising service\nowned by Google, that places more than 60 bil-\nlion online ads per month. DoubleClick pro-\nvides reports on the placement and performance\nof these ads to both publishers and advertisers\nand also helps create ads and widgets.\nMiddlemen companies act as brokers for\nonline ad space that they aggregate across dif-\nferent sites and package as single buys, in\neffect setting up an ad network. These ad net-\nworkers offer less well designed sites and posi-\ntions and may sell space for less than a dollar\nper thousand viewers. They are criticized for\nflooding the Internet with cheap and some-\ntimes tacky ads. Data-mining companies like\nBlue Kai and eXelate Media collect data on\nhow visitors move around among sites and\nthen sell access to advertising on groups of\nsites that attract similar visitors. This is similar\nto how local newspaper advertising can be pur-\nchased through group contracts and makes\nbuying much more efficient.31\nThis is a button on the DoubleClick website that lets advertisers create\nanimated widget ads. If you were working for your local campus Google, Microsoft, and AOLhave gotten\nnewspaper, what kind of widget would you design for the publication into the ad sales business by setting up ad ex-\nand where would it be displayed? changes that allow advertisers to bid directly\nCHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 405\non available ad space on large groups of websites. In effect,\nthey are cutting out the middlemen. Other big websites, such\nas ESPN, Turner Broadcasting, and Forbes magazine, have\nstopped doing business with the ad networks in order to gain\nbetter control over the quality of the content on their sites.\nThe Online Publishers Association, which represents major\npublishers of Web content, reported on a study that found\nthat ads on portals, as well as ads bought from ad brokers,\nwere significantly less effective than the ads that the pre-\nmium sites offer. The idea is that the portals and ad net-\nworkers’ads may be cheaper but they appear in formats that\nare less interesting and thus are less likely to connect with\nvisitors.32\nSocial Media Tools Online games engage potential customers with the brand\nand help build relationships through positive emotional\nSocial media marketing refers to the use of blogs, linked\ninteractions.\nsocial networks (Facebook, Twitter), and online communi-\nties (sports and celebrity fans, brand communities) to build\nrelationships with customers. For example, for the launch of its 2010 GTI Hatchback, for ex-\nample, Volkswagen created a racing game using iPhones and iPod Touch to win a car. Players\ncould send messages on Twitter and post videos of their games on YouTube.\nMarketers use these new social media tools to promote brands, engage customers, and create Principle\nbrand relationships—and most of these efforts are free or cheap compared to other forms of mar- Conversation-based social\nketing communication. They are not only a point of connection—a digital touchpoint—but they media through such sites\nalso open up a “social web,” a network of people connected through the social media site.

It’s on steroids.\nword-of-mouth advertising on steroids.\nAn example comes from the video game discussion of the Guitar Hero:Smash Hitswebsite\nand banners by art director Diego Contreras in Chapter 11. That promotion was also supported by\na “Facebook Connect” function. Here’s how Contreras explained this idea:\nFacebook Connect is a reflection of recent Web 2.0 technology and social media trends. It\nbasically allows you to log in to Facebook through the Smash Hits site and voice your\nthoughts/comments about the site or “trash-talk” others on the comment section. Your\ncomments would also be posted on your Facebook Wall, as well as all of your voting re-\nsults. So, say I voted for Bon Jovi for Song of the Year, it would show up on my Facebook\nWall with a link for my friends to vote for their favorite songs and post them to their pro-\nfiles too.\nIn the A Matter of Principlefeature, David Rittenhouse, who is a media director at Ogilvy’s\nonline agency, explains his view of this rapidly growing and changing media environment and\nthe principle of homophilythat drives online communities and digital associations.\nAsocial media campaign for the Ford Fiesta relaunch invited 100 people, who had been\nthoroughly vetted by the Fiesta team, to take control of the brand’s online message.
