But it’s not just hot Internet companies that have achieved this type of leadership—\nMcIlhenny’s Tabasco Sauce, which was launched in 1868, created and still owns the hot sauce\ncategory.\nA technique called feature analysis helps structure an assessment of features relative to\ncompetitors’products to identify where a brand has an advantage. To conduct a feature analysis,\nfirst, make a chart of the product and competitors’products, listing relevant features, as the fol-\nlowing table illustrates. Then evaluate how well the product and the competitors’products per-\nform on those features. What are the brand’s strong points or weak points? Next, evaluate how\nimportant each feature is to the target audience using opinion research. In other words, how much\ndo consumers care about various features (which ones are most important to them) and how do\nthe various brands compare on these features?\nHow to Do a Feature Analysis\nProduct Performance\nFeature Importance to Prospect Yours X Y Z\nPrice 1 (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2)\nQuality 4 (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2)\nStyle 2 (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:3)\nAvailability 3 (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:3)\nDurability 5 (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)\nUsing the two factors of importance and performance, competitive advantageis found where\n(1) the product has a strong feature (2) in an area that is important to the target and (3) where the com-\npetition is weaker. The product in the preceding table would compete well on both price and style against\nX, on price against competitor Y, and on style against competitor Z. Competitor X seems the most vul-\nnerable on two features, price and style, that consumers rate as the most important decision points.\nAnexampleofaproductlaunchthatwasbuiltonacompetitiveadvantagestrategywasSprint’s\nPalmPre,whichwaslaunchedindirectcompetitionwithApple’siPhone.ThePre’sadvantagewas\nmultitasking,especiallytheabilitytoswitchbetweenseveralopenapplicationsandwebsites.\nLocating the Brand Position Let’s return now to the concept of a position to see how it is cre-\nated. In addition to specific product attributes, a number of factors can be used to locate a posi-\ntion for a brand including the following:\n• Superiority PositionJack Trout suggests that positioning is always easy if something is\nfaster, fancier, safer, or newer.\n• PreemptivePositionBeingfirstinthecategoryoftencreatescategoryleadershipand\ndominance.\n• Value PositionWalmart’s “Always Low Prices” is the epitome of offering good value for the\nmoney. Hyundai rode that position through the economic downturn and picked up market\nshare faster than its competitors, passing both Honda and Ford to become the 4th largest au-\ntomaker in the world.10\n• Psychological PositionOften brands are designed around nonproduct differences. For psy-\nchological positions, consider these examples: Volvo owns the safety position, Coke owns a\nposition of authenticity for colas (“It’s the real thing”), and Hallmark a quality position\n(“When you care enough to send the very best”).\n• Benefit PositionHow does the product help the consumer?\n• Usage PositionHow, where, and when is the product used and who is using it?\n• Competitor’s StrategyHow can the product go head to head with or move completely away\nfrom the competition?\n• Category FactorsIs the competition coming from outside the category and, if so, how does\nthe brand compare to these other categories and how does that change the analysis of\nPrinciple strengths and weaknesses?\nStrong brands are known\nAs we’ve mentioned the differences have to be distinctive to the brand, as well as important\nfor one thing—the test is\nto the consumer. The point is that strong brands become well known for one thing. When you\n“What do you think of\nwhen you mention the think of Google or eBay, what’s the first thing that comes to mind?

The com-\npany created new programs offering parenting advice and con-\nducted research on infant-related problems such as sleeping that\nled to product redesigns.11\nMany ad campaigns are designed to establish the brand’s po-\nsition by giving the right set of cues about these decision factors to\nhelp place the brand in the consumer’s mind. If a position is a point\nin a consumer’s mind, planners can map that—in fact, the way\nplanners compare positions is by using a technique called a\nperceptual mapthat plots all of the competitors on a matrix based\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NAVY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Navy is a branch of the military focused on naval and maritime operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARMY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Army is a branch of the military responsible for land-based military operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AIR FORCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Air Force is a branch of the military that focuses on aerial and space warfare)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Marines are a branch of the military known for rapid-response and amphibious operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCILHENNY'S TABASCO SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McIlhenny's Tabasco Sauce is a brand that created and dominates the hot sauce category since 1868)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sprint is a telecommunications company that launched the Palm Pre in competition with Apple's iPhone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALM PRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Palm Pre is a smartphone launched by Sprint, known for its multitasking capabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple is a technology company known for its iPhone, a leading smartphone in the market)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALMART<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Walmart is a retail corporation known for its value position with the slogan \"Always Low Prices\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYUNDAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hyundai is an automaker that became the 4th largest in the world by offering good value during economic downturns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOLVO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Volvo is an automotive brand known for its safety position)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Coke is a beverage brand known for its authenticity position with the slogan \"It's the real thing\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HALLMARK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hallmark is a brand known for its quality position with the slogan \"When you care enough to send the very best\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google is a technology company known primarily as a search engine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EBAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>eBay is an online auction and shopping website)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROCTER & GAMBLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Procter & Gamble is a multinational consumer goods corporation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAMPERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pampers is a brand of baby products owned by Procter & Gamble, known for its purpose-based marketing approach)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMES STENGEL<|>PERSON<|>James Stengel is the former global marketing chief at Procter & Gamble who developed the purpose-based marketing approach)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAVY<|>ARMY<|>Both are branches of the military with distinct operational focuses<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAVY<|>AIR FORCE<|>Both are branches of the military with distinct operational focuses<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAVY<|>MARINES<|>Both are branches of the military with distinct operational focuses<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARMY<|>AIR FORCE<|>Both are branches of the military with distinct operational focuses<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARMY<|>MARINES<|>Both are branches of the military with distinct operational focuses<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AIR FORCE<|>MARINES<|>Both are branches of the military with distinct operational focuses<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPRINT<|>PALM PRE<|>Sprint launched the Palm Pre as a competitive product against Apple's iPhone<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPRINT<|>APPLE<|>Sprint's Palm Pre was launched in direct competition with Apple's iPhone<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PALM PRE<|>APPLE<|>The Palm Pre was launched as a competitor to Apple's iPhone<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WALMART<|>HYUNDAI<|>Both companies are known for their value positions in their respective markets<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOLVO<|>COKE<|>Both brands are known for their strong psychological positions in safety and authenticity, respectively<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COKE<|>HALLMARK<|>Both brands are known for their strong psychological positions in authenticity and quality, respectively<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE<|>EBAY<|>Both are well-known brands in the technology and online services sector<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROCTER & GAMBLE<|>PAMPERS<|>Pampers is a brand owned by Procter & Gamble<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAMES STENGEL<|>PROCTER & GAMBLE<|>James Stengel was the former global marketing chief at Procter & Gamble<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAMES STENGEL<|>PAMPERS<|>James Stengel developed the purpose-based marketing approach used by Pampers<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
