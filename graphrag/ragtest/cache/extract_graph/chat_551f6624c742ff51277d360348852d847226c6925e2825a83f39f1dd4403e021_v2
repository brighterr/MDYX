New technology and a new management philosophy, however, cre-\nated a new way of doing business.\nTo truly operate with an IMC orientation, Dentsu underwent a total reorganization and de-\nsigned a comprehensive new IMC toolkit. Now the giant agency’s employees have sophisticated\ntools to actually deliver on that total communication promise with a more advanced approach that\nDentsu calls IMC 2.0. It defines IMC 2.0 as “an ongoing systematic process for creatively plan-\nning, production, and evaluating brand communication that creates customer relationships, builds\nstrong brands, and increases sales and profits.”6\nTo engineer this turnaround, it first held an IMC audit, conducted by IMC leader Professor\nTom Duncan, to determine its IMC strengths and weakness internally, as well as in the eyes of\nkey clients. Then it created an IMC Development Division with the mission of undertaking the\nIMC R&D arm. That division has some 90 to 100 staff members dedicated to basic research into\nIMC processes. The agency also created an IMC online site with more than 250 planning tools,\nmodels, and processes that can be used in IMC 2.0 projects. This portal also provides access to\ncase studies, training modules, articles, and research on IMC. It registers more than 2,000 unique\nvisits a day from Dentsu employees.\nAn IMC Planning Center with 350 people from a variety of media and marcom areas was\nestablished. The staff members assigned to this department are given intensive IMC training so\nthey have the skills to work in cross-functional IMC teams on client projects brought to them by\nvarious account groups. The agency’s Brand Creation Center, an existing brand consulting group,\nwas also integrated into the IMC Planning Center. Finally, each of Dentsu’s 22 account groups\nhas 5 to 10 embedded account planners who are trained in IMC practices. These planners help ed-\nucate clients on the goals of IMC and establish a common language for planning.\nIt’s a work in progress—and one complicated by the worldwide recession—but Dentsu’s\nIMC executives and managers believed that the investment in reorganization was justified. The\neffort didn’t come cheap: Dentsu initially dedicated some 600 of its 4,500 employees to IMC de-\nvelopment and client services.\nThe Management of Synergy We have mentioned elsewhere in the book that one goal of inte- Tenth Principle of IMC\ngration is message synergy. Because everything a brand does sends a message, IMC planners Integration happens when\nstrive to manage a total communication program to deliver a consistent brand presence. As Dun- what your brand says\ncan said in the Part 5 opener, “It’s not just advertising . . . it’s everything a brand says and does.” matches what it does and\nThe end result is brand message synergy,a foundational truth that means when all the pieces work what others say about it.\ntogether, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\nAnother way to understand this synergy in the IMC\ncontext is the say–do–confirm integration triangle. This Say\ntriangle identifies three key aspects that must work to-\ngether to create integration: (1) what the company or brand Planned\nsays about itself (say), (2) how the company or brand per- messages\nforms (do), (3) and what other people say about it\n(confirm). Figure 18.1shows these relationships. The im-\nportant principle here is that, since a brand is an integrated\nperception, a brand is what people say about it—and that\ndefines your brand’s reputation. Furthermore integration\nConfirm Do\nfails if there are gaps between what the marketing com-\nmunication says, what the brand does (performance, social\nUnplanned Product, service\nresponsibility), and what others say (reputation). Those\nmessages messages\ngaps are the ultimate test of integration. Because a brand is\nan integrated perception, a brand is what people say about FIGURE 18.1\nit—it fails as an integrated perception if there are gaps be- The Integration Triangle\ntween say, do, and confirm. The say–do–confirm model explains how planned marketing communication\nIn most cases the drive for brand consistency is a messages (say) are either reinforced or undercut by messages delivered by\nthe product or service marketing mix (how well the brand and company per-\nstrategic need, but at other times it reflects cost efficiency.\nform its business) and unplanned messages (what others say). Why do you\nIMC programs can be more effective because of their rep-\nthink we say that a brand is integrated when there are no gaps between the\netition, and this reinforcement, along with synergy, creates say, do, and confirm messages?\nmore cost-efficient campaigns.
