Tasks performed by the company’s marketing ser-\nvices department include the following: select the agencies; coordinate activities with vendors,\nsuch as media, production, and photography; make sure the work gets done as scheduled; and de-\ntermine whether the work has achieved prescribed objectives.\nThe Media The third player in the advertising world is the media. The emergence of mass me-\ndia has been a central factor in the development of advertising because mass media offers a way\nto reach a widespread audience. In traditional advertising, the term mediarefers to all of the chan-\nnels of communication that carry the message from the advertiser to the audience and from con-\nsumers back to companies. We refer to these media as channelsbecause they deliver messages,\nbut they are also companies, such as your local newspaper or radio station.\nSome of these media conglomerates are huge, such as Time Warner and Viacom. Time\nWarner, for example, is a $40 billion company with some 38,000 employees. It owns HBO, Time\nInc., Turner Broadcasting, and Warner Brothers, among other media companies. You can learn\nmore about this media conglomerate at www.timewarner.com. Media vehicles are the specific\nprograms, such as 60 MinutesorThe Simpsons,or magazines—The New York Times,Advertising\nAge,Woman’s Day.\nNote that mediais plural when it refers to various channels, but singular—medium—when\nit refers to only one form, such as newspapers.\nEach medium (newspaper, radio or TVstation, billboard company, etc.) has a department that\nis responsible for selling ad space or time. These departments specialize in assisting advertisers in\nFIGURE 1.3\nTwo Advertising Organization Structures\nWHEN THE ADVERTISER DOESN’T HAVE AN IN-HOUSE WHEN THE ADVERTISER HAS AN IN-HOUSE AGENCY\nAGENCY\nAdvertising Advertising Advertising Internal Advertising\nOrganization Department Organization Department\nExternal Agencies In-House Agency\n• Full-Service Agency • Research/Planning\n• Media Specialists • Creative Development\n• Creative Boutiques • Media\n• Vendors (freelance writers, • Production\nlighting specialists, etc.)\nCHAPTER 1 • THE NEW WORLD OF MARKETING COMMUNICATION 21\ncomparing the effectiveness of various media as they try to select the best mix of media to use.\nMany media organizations will assist advertisers in the design and production of advertisements.\nThat’s particularly true for local advertisers using local media, such as a retailer preparing an ad-\nvertisement for the local newspaper.\nThe primary advantage of advertising’s use of mass mediais that the costs to buy time in\nPrinciple\nbroadcast media, space in print media, and time and space in digital media are spread over the\nAdvertising is cost\ntremendous number of people that these media reach. For example, $3 million may sound like a\nefficient when it uses mass\nlot of money for one Super Bowl ad, but when you consider that the advertisers are reaching more media to reach large\nthan 100 million people, the cost is not so extreme. One of the big advantages of mass-media ad- numbers of prospective\nvertising is that it can reach a lot of people with a single message in a very cost-efficient form. consumers.\nProfessional Suppliers and Consultants The fourth player in the world of advertising include\nartists, writers, photographers, directors, producers, printers, and self-employed freelancers and\nconsultants. In the “1984” story, the movie director Ridley Scott was a supplier in that Chiat/Day\ncontracted with him to produce the commercial. This array of suppliers mirrors the variety of\ntasks required to put together an ad. Other examples include freelance copywriters and graphic\nartists, songwriters, printers, market researchers, direct-mail production houses, telemarketers,\nand public relations consultants. Why would the other advertising players hire an outside sup-\nplier? There are many reasons. The advertiser or the agency may not have expertise in a special-\nized area, their people may be overloaded with work, or they may want a fresh perspective. They\nalso may not want to incur the overhead of full-time employees.\nTypes of Agencies\nWe are primarily concerned with advertising agencies in this chapter, but other areas such as pub-\nlic relations, direct marketing, sales promotion, and the Internet have agencies that provide spe-\ncialized promotional help, as well.\nThe A-List awards by Advertising Agerecognize cutting-edge agencies that rank high in three\nareas: First they are creative—Ad Agecalls them “widely imaginative”—in developing brand strate-\ngies and executions. Second, they are fast growing and winners of some of the biggest new business\npitches. Finally, they are recognized for their effectiveness. In other words, their work leads to mea-\nsurable results. Note that the agencies in the following list represent big and small agencies, as well\nas full-service and specialized agencies. At the top of the list is the agency of the year, Crispin\nPorter(cid:2)Bogusky, the agency behind the Burger King “Whopper Freakout” campaign.\nA-List of Advertising Agencies\n1.
