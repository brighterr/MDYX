How are promotions used strategically in terms of brand building,integration,and effectiveness?\nFrontier Campaigns for Favorite\nAnimal Votes and Web Hits\nHow do you follow up a successful campaign like Frontier Airline’s “Flip to\nMexico” campaign? (See Chapter 8’s opening story.) Frontier handed\nShawn Couzens and Gary Ennis, creative directors from Grey Worldwide in\nNew York City, their next challenge: Drive consumers to the website. Airlines pre-\nfer passengers to book on the Web rather than via phone with agents because the\ncompany saves money, and capturing e-mails builds the airline’s database.\nSometimes to reach the marketing and campaign objectives, advertisers need\nto be willing to take risks to be rewarded. How far could Couzens and Ennis push\nFrontier?\nCouzens explained, “We would never do something ‘out there’ just to do it. It\nhas to line up with the strategy and reflect who we are. A brand is a lot like a per-\nson. It has a distinct personality, a unique identity, and a belief system. And just like\na person, if we misrepresent the brand, then people won’t trust it. So, whenever\nwe embark on an assignment, we ask, ‘Is this consistent with our brand personal-\nity? Does this deliver on our brand promise?’ And if the idea doesn’t fit who Fron-\ntier is or what people expect from us, then we dump it.”\nThe Grey team created an online contest that let citizens vote for their favorite\nanimal. Seven of the animals campaigned via the Frontier website in a satire of real\npolitical campaigns. Would people pick Grizwald the Bear, Flip the Dolphin, Hec-\ntor the Otter, Jack (who else?) the Rabbit, Larry the Lynx, the Penguins, or Sal the\nCougar?\nCouzens described how the contest fit the brand: “Fortunately, our brand per-\nsonality is easygoing, friendly, and fun. We’re ‘a whole different animal,’ so we can\ndo things that demonstrate how different and unique we are—and that comes\nthrough not just in the ads but in the brand experience as a whole.”\nFans could go to Frontier’s home page to get to the contest, then click on a\nsqueaky door to enter the virtual Campaign Headquarters. Once there, visitors\ncould interact with various aspects of the campaign: They could listen to a debate\nbetween trash-talking contestants, order posters of their favorite animal, watch\n517\n518 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\ncommercials on a TV set, order real press kits with T-shirts, listen to each contes-\ntant’s platform, join a YouTube group, or participate in an online forum.\nHere’s a sample of the animals’ political platforms: Griz the Bear wants to give\nvoters free all-you-can-eat buffets, back massages, and free flights for every man,\nwoman, and child, none of which, unsurprisingly, are endorsed by Frontier. Jack\nruns on an environmental platform. He promises lower health care costs, a\nstatewide cap on fuel costs, and reductions in greenhouse emissions. Hector ap-\nparently chooses to run on his good looks: He is cute and cuddly and can make\nsquishy sounds with his cheeks. The commercials even let the candidates engage\nin a bit of political backbiting.\nBuilt-in fun on the site captured visitors’ attention with a clock that actually told\ntime, a spinning fan, and a coffee cup that spilled when you clicked on it.\nThe results? Turn to the It’s a Wrapsection at the end of the chapter to see who\nwon the hearts of Frontier fans.\nSources:Shawn M.

Sales pro-\nmotion is about the fun, creative, and exciting ideas that the promotion industry uses to spur ac-\ntion and build strong brand relationships. In this chapter, we will explain the difference between\nconsumer and trade promotions, as well as other programs, such as loyalty programs, tie-ins, and\nsponsorships, that cross the line between advertising, PR, and promotion. First let’s discuss the\nconcept and basic principles of sales promotion.\nWHY SALES PROMOTION?\nWhen a marketer increases the value of its product or brand by offering an extra incentive to pur-\nchase it, the marketer is creating a sales promotion,which is the subject of this chapter. In most\ncases the objective of sales promotion is to encourage action. Promotions in a more general sense\ncan also help build brand identity and awareness, as the Frontier Airlines case illustrates, but their\nprimary contribution to most marketing communication programs is to drive behavior.\nThe Promotion Marketing Association (PMA) is the professional organization serving this\n$2 trillion industry. Founded in 1911, the organization promotes excellence in promotion mar-\nketing and showcases such\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FRONTIER AIRLINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Frontier Airlines is an airline company known for its creative and engaging marketing campaigns, such as the 'Flip to Mexico' and 'Denver's Favorite Animal' campaigns, which aim to drive consumer engagement and brand loyalty)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHAWN COUZENS<|>PERSON<|>Shawn Couzens is a creative director at Grey Worldwide in New York City, responsible for developing innovative marketing strategies for Frontier Airlines)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARY ENNIS<|>PERSON<|>Gary Ennis is a creative director at Grey Worldwide in New York City, working alongside Shawn Couzens on marketing campaigns for Frontier Airlines)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREY WORLDWIDE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Grey Worldwide is a global advertising and marketing agency that collaborates with Frontier Airlines to create unique promotional campaigns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DENVER'S FAVORITE ANIMAL<|>EVENT<|>Denver's Favorite Animal is a promotional campaign by Frontier Airlines that involved an online contest where participants voted for their favorite animal, integrating fun and interactive elements to engage consumers)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRONTIER AIRLINES<|>SHAWN COUZENS<|>Shawn Couzens is a creative director responsible for developing marketing campaigns for Frontier Airlines<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRONTIER AIRLINES<|>GARY ENNIS<|>Gary Ennis is a creative director responsible for developing marketing campaigns for Frontier Airlines<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRONTIER AIRLINES<|>GREY WORLDWIDE<|>Grey Worldwide collaborates with Frontier Airlines to create innovative marketing campaigns<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRONTIER AIRLINES<|>DENVER'S FAVORITE ANIMAL<|>Denver's Favorite Animal is a promotional campaign by Frontier Airlines to engage consumers and build brand loyalty<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHAWN COUZENS<|>GARY ENNIS<|>Shawn Couzens and Gary Ennis work together as creative directors at Grey Worldwide on campaigns for Frontier Airlines<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
