This outline is based on the Facets Model of Effects that we first introduced in Chapter 4.\nMessage Development Research\nDeciding what facts to convey in marketing communication is never easy. Research is needed to\ndevelop and test alternative message strategies. Planners conduct research with members of the\ntarget audience to develop the message strategy and test the relative effectiveness of various sell-\ning premises—hard sell or soft sell, informational or emotional, and so forth. Insights into con-\nsumer motivations and purchasing decisions help solve the often-difficult puzzle of selecting the\nmost relevant information and motivating promise as well as the emotional appeal that best en-\ngages the audience.\nConcept Testing Advertising and other marketing communication messages usually incorpo-\nrate a Big Idea, a creative concept that is attention getting and memorable. Research in concept\ntesting compares the effectiveness of various message strategies and their creative ideas. This\ntesting often relies on a key concept card, which is an artist’s drawing of the visual idea with a\nsentence underneath that captures the essence of the idea. Aresearcher may use a pack of three,\nfive, or more idea cards or rough layouts to elicit consumer responses in a mall or through dis-\ncussions in a focus group.\nAn example of effective concept testing that was used in a campaign’s development is\nVolvo’s GLBTcampaign, which was the first campaign of its kind to receive an Advertising Re-\nsearch Foundation (ARF) David Ogilvy award. Witeck-Combs Communications in collaboration\nwith Prime Access, Inc., developed a set of concepts and rough ad executions representing a range\nof GLBT-specific imagery and copy. Ford and Volvo managers selected their top three choices\nfrom the group of proposed ad ideas. The messages were tested to assess the constructs of brand-\ning, communication, and persuasion, including the concept of consumer connection, or whether\nthe ad makes consumers feel closer to the brand. These constructs were measured in four ways—\ncognitive, behavior, emotional, and aspirational dimensions.\nPretesting Another type of evaluative research, called pretesting,helps marketers make final\ngo/no-go decisions about finished or nearly finished ads. Pretesting differs from concept testing\nCHAPTER 19 • EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS 585\nor message strategy research, which reveals the strengths and weaknesses of different versions of\na concept or approach as marketers develop them. Pretesting assesses the strength of the finished\nmessage and predicts how well it will perform.\nIn terms of print advertisements, the ideas to be tested are often full mockups of the ad. In\ntelevision, advertisers can test the commercials as storyboard ideas or photoboards(still photos\narranged as a storyboard), but more often commercials are in the form of animatics(drawings or\nstill photos shot on videotape synchronized with a rough version of the audio track). Advertisers\ncan show these versions of the commercial to individuals, to focus groups, or in a theater testing\nsituation. They follow the viewing of the advertisement with a survey, a more open-ended inter-\nview, or a set of questions for a group discussion.\nDiagnostics Many advertisers and agencies are moving away from copytesting methods that Principle\nrely on single scores to evaluate an ad and turning to methods that are more focused on diag- Advertising effects are too\nnosing strengths and weaknesses. The reason is that they believe an advertisement is too com- complicated to be\nplex to be reduced to one factor and one simple score. Instead they are using research methods reduced to a single score.\ndesigned to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of their advertising ideas to improve the\nwork while it is still in development or to learn more from the ad to improve subsequent\nadvertisements.\nIntheatertestsforTVcommercials,forexample,respondentsmayhaveablack-boxdevice\nandcanpressabuttontorecorddifferenttypesofresponses—indicatingwhattheylikedordidn’t\nlikeorhowlongtheypaidattentionbylettinguponthebuttonwhentheirattentionshifts.\nMoment-by-momenttestsofcommercialsprovideananalysisoftheimpactoftheinter-\nnallogicofthecommercial.TheAmeritestcompany,whoseworkisdescribedintheA Matter\nofPractice,looksattwodimensionsofmoment-by-momenttests:aFlowofAttentionmeasure\nandaFlowofEmotionmeasure.Theprocedureinvolvesshowingaclutterreel,agroupofcom-\nmercials that includes the test commercial, competitors’commercials, and other ads, and con-\nductinginterviewsafterward.TheAmeritestmethodusesapicturesorttodiagnosetheviewer’s\nattentiontoandemotionalengagementwithdifferentelementsinthecommercial.Theviewers\nreceive a deck of key frames from the commercial and sort them into images they remember\nseeingandonestheydon’tremember.Thentheysortthemintofivecategoriesfromstrongpos-\nitivetostrongnegative.Theresearcherstabulatethesetstodepicttheflowofimpactforboth\nattentionandemotion.Inparticular,theywanttoidentifyandanalyzekeymomentsinthecom-\nmercialsuchasthesolutiontoaproblemortheintroductionofthebrandandanalyzethemin\ntermsofviewers’attentionandemotion.6TheA MatterofPracticeboxtakesyouthroughthis\nanalysis.\nDuring Execution: Concurrent Testing\nConcurrent testing takes place while the advertising is running. There are three primary tech-\nniques: coincidental surveys, attitude tests, and tracking studies. The first two assess communi-\ncation responses; tracking studies evaluate actual behavior.\nThecoincidental surveytechnique is most often used with broadcast media.
