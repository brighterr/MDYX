This section provides\na framework for you to understand how all of these programs and tools can work together to en-\ngage target audiences with consistent, persuasive messages that get people talking about a brand.\nIn this part we introduce a collection of key marketing communication tools whose activi-\nties need to be coordinated as part of an integrated communication program. To help you under-\nstand how this works to deliver effective brand communication, consider the summary of lessons\nlearned by Professor Tom Duncan, one of the early leaders in IMC education.\nLessons We Have Learned\nabout IMC\nOriginally IMC was about creating “one voice, one look” across all messages in a campaign. So\nthe print ad “looked like” the television commercial and the billboard matched the website. We\nnow know that a more effective approach to IMC has moved from this narrow “execution” fo-\ncus to a much broader focus on branding and customer brand perceptions. Rather than just\nusing advertising to sell products, companies now want to use everything that sends a\nmessage to create a coherent brand presence that leads to long-term brand relationships.\nTom Duncan\nIMC Founder and Director\nEmeritus, University\nof Colorado and Daniels\nSchool of Business at the\nUniversity of Denver\n456\nCHAPTER 15 • Public Relations\nCHAPTER 16 • Direct Response\nCHAPTER 17 • Promotions\nCHAPTER 18 • The IMC Umbrella\nCHAPTER 19 • Evaluation of Effectiveness\nAlthough IMC has been around for 20 years, few understand the breadth—and depth—\nofthiscommunicationfocus.It’snotjustadvertising;it’snotjustmarketingcommunication;it’s\neverythingabrandsaysanddoes.IMCinvolvestheentireorganization.\nIMC is a common-sense ongoing process for managing brand perceptions and experiences,\nas well as customer expectations about the brand. IMC planning delivers the brand essence (po-\nsition, personality, image) in all marketing communication, but also at all brand contact points.\nIt engages all stakeholders in meaningful and often interactive brand experiences. When these\nbest practices are applied, they lead to solid brand relationships and that leads to enhanced brand\nequity.\nThe chapters in this part introduce you to the various marketing communication tools and\nplatforms, including public relations, direct response marketing, and promotions. We tie every-\nthing up with a chapter on the IMC umbrella which reviews basic IMC principles and practices,\nas well as the big picture of total communication. The last chapter focuses on how these various\ntools evaluate effectiveness.\n457\n15\nPublic Relations\nIt’s a Winner\nCampaign: Corporation: Agency: Award:\n“Save-A- Hampton Hotels Cohn & Wolfe PRSA Silver Anvil\nLandmark”\nR\nE\nT\nP\nA\nH\nC\n458\nCHAPTER KEY POINTS\n1. What is public relations?\n2. What are the different types of public relations programs?\n3. What key decisions do public relations practitioners make when they create plans?\n4. What are the most common types of public relations tools?\n5. Why is measuring the results of public relations efforts important,and how should that be done?\nThe Ultimate Road Trip\nThe quest started with Hampton Hotels’ challenge to the public relations firm\nCohn & Wolfe to create awareness among customers of the 1,600 Hampton\nhotels across the United States and position the brand as a civic-minded in-\ndustry leader. The destination was a campaign that helped save many landmarks\nof historical and cultural significance.\nSo why should a midpriced hotel brand, which includes Hampton Inn and\nHampton Inn & Suites, care about preserving the nation’s landmarks when its busi-\nness is renting rooms?\nA road map in the form of research guided the way. Results from a survey of\nabout 1,000 people revealed that 9 out of 10 Americans believe it is important to\npreserve the country’s roadside landmarks. Furthermore, 83 percent of respon-\ndents indicated that corporations ought to share responsibility for preserving the\nnation’s landmarks.\nTheinterestinpreservingthesesitesisanaturalfitforHampton.Three-quarters\nof the people staying in Hampton’s properties drive. Given the number of hotels\ncrisscrossingthecountry,thetravelersarelikelytoencountertheseimportantplaces\nmarkingsignificanteventsinthecountry’shistoryastheydrivetotheirdestinations.\nAlso Hampton stands for traditional American values, civic responsibility, and\ndevout patriotism. Even its logo is red, white, and blue. So there seemed to be mu-\ntual interests between the goals of the corporation and its guests.\nBut the most important reason for undertaking this project is to build good-\nwill, the greatest asset any organization can have. A well-informed public with a\npositive attitude toward an organization is critical to the organization’s survival—\nand that is why creating goodwill, this positive attitude, is the primary goal of most\npublic relations programs.\nHere’s how Cohn & Wolfe, together with Hampton, created a campaign that\ngenerated great pride for the hotel and helped preserve culturally or historically\nimportant roadside landmarks. Some of the highlights of the program included:\n• Building a “Save-A-Landmark” website offering vacation or weekend “drive-\nabouts” to landmarks across the country\n459\n460 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\n• Making the website interactive by permitting visitors to suggest and vote for\nlandmarks that needed saving\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
