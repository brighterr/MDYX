Amid all the clut-\nter in the media environment, selection is a huge problem. The ability to draw attention that\nbrings visibility to a brand is one of advertising’s greatest strengths. Advertisements, particu-\nlarly television commercials, are often designed to be intrusive,which means they intrude\non people’s perception in order to grab attention.\n• InterestAfactor in crossing the selection barrier is interest,which means the receiver of the\nmessage has become mentally engaged in some way with the ad and the product. Ad mes-\nsages are designed not only to get attention, but also to hold the audience’s interest long\nenough for the audience to register the point of the ad. That level of interest and attention is\nsometimes referred to as stickiness, particularly for websites.\n• RelevanceOne reason people are interested in something is relevance,which means the\nmessage, such as the accompanying example for the Peace Corps, connects on some per-\nsonal level. The Peace Corps launched a national recruiting campaign with the theme “Life\nis calling. How far will you go?” It was designed to address more relevant personal issues\nfor potential volunteers and tell them how the volunteer experience would enrich their lives.\n• CuriosityAnother reason people pay attention is curiosity,which results from questioning,\nwanting to know more, or being intrigued by something. Curiosity also may be a problem\nfor certain types of campaigns, such as antidrug and anti-smoking efforts, as Ohio Univer-\nsity Professor Carson B. Wagner found out in his research on the government’s “Just Say\nNo” campaign. He explains:\nOne weekend, my father, who is an advertis-\ning executive, and I got into a conversation\nabout how it seemed every time a news story\naired about illicit drugs, a small epidemic of\ndrug use would ensue. Of course, there’s\nbeen a lot of research done about the ways\nmedia can encourage drug use, but most of\nthat is about popular media such as movies\nand music. We’d presume that news pro-\ngrams and antidrug ads that are meant to\nshow illicit drugs in a negative light\nshouldn’t lead people toward drugs. But, as\nalmost any student of communication has\nlearned, media don’t tell us what to think;\nthey tell us what to think about.\nSo, I decided to test the idea on antidrug\nads—the most counterintuitive possibility—\nin a small experiment for my master’s thesis. I\nscouredprior research, but I couldn’t find\nanything suggesting that antidrug ads might\nlead to drug use. Almost all studies showed\nthat drug attitudes became more negative.\nBut, the psychology-of-curiosity literature\nsuggested something else: If antidrug ads\nmake people think drug use is widespread,\nthey might become curious about experiment-\ning themselves. My study found that the cu-\nriosity literature was correct.\nWagner’s counterintuitive results were so\ncompelling that he found himself on talk shows\nand featured in news and wire stories. He also pre-\nsented his findings to Congress. Since then, a large-\nscale government-sponsored survey examining the\nMessages that are relevant speak to a consumer’s special first five years of the government’s “Just Say No”\ninterests. campaign uncovered similar relationships between\nCHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 109\nantidrug advertising and drug use. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem to have gotten any better\nreception than Wagner’s study did. It’s hard to convince some experts that even negative at-\ntention is still attention.\n• AwarenessWhen you are aware of something, you know that you have seen it or heard it\nbefore. In other words, awarenessresults when an advertisement makes an impression—\nwhen something registers. New product campaigns, for example, seek to create high levels\nof brand awareness. Brand reminder ads on billboards and Web pages are also designed to\nmaintain a high level of awareness of familiar brands, as are logos on clothing.\n• RecognitionAdvertisers are interested in two types of memory: recognitionwhich means\npeople remember seeing the ad, and recall,which means they remember what the ad said.\nRecognition is a measure of perception and is used to determine awareness. Recall is a mea-\nsure of understanding, which we will talk about in a later section on cognitive effects.\nRecognition relies on simple visuals that lock into memory, such as logos (Nike’s swoosh),\nas well as colors (IBM’s blue), jingles and sounds (Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” for\nUnited Airlines), characters (the Energizer bunny), key visuals (Polo’s pony, the disbelieving\nlook of the Aflac duck), and slogans (Altoids, “The Curiously Strong Mints”). Memory de-\npends heavily on repetition to anchor an impression in the mind.\nThe Synergy Requirement We mentioned earlier Preston’s idea that the end result of effective Fifth Principle of IMC\nadvertising and marketing communication is an integrated perception. We call that a brand. In People automatically\ncampaigns that use an IMC approach, marketers coordinate all the marketing communication integrate brand messages\nmessages to create synergy,which means individual messages have more impact working jointly and experiences. Synergy\nto promote a product than they would working on their own.22The reason is that people auto- occurs when all of the\nmatically integrate the messages and experiences they have with a brand to create their own messages work together\nto create a coherent\npersonal brand perception. This happens whether or not the marketer plans for integrated com-\nbrand perception.\nmunicated. That’s just how perception works. Sophisticated managers understand this and try to\nmanage their communication\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PEACE CORPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Peace Corps is an organization that launched a national recruiting campaign with the theme 'Life is calling.
