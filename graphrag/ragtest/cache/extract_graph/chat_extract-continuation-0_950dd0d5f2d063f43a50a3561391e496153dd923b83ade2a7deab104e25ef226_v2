In the early 1990s in\nChina, for example, there was hardly an advertising\nindustry or advertising media opportunities. China is\nwidely recognized as the world’s most fragmented\nmarket.

All these approaches fall into three groups: tight central international control, central-\nized resources with moderate control, or a match of the client’s organization—if the client is\nhighly centralized, then the agency account structure will be highly centralized.\nThe IMC Factor in International Campaign Planning\nIntegrated marketing communication means that all the messages a consumer receives about a\nbrand work together to create a coherent brand impression. To do that on a global level requires\nboth horizontal and vertical coordination. The vertical effort represents the coordination of the\nkey planning decisions, such as targeting, positioning, objectives, strategies, and tactics across all\nthe various tools used in the communication program. The horizontal level requires coordination\nacross all countries and regions involved in the plan.\nBecause of this complexity, it takes a dedicated manager to ensure that all the various mar-\nketing communication activities stay consistent to the brand and campaign strategy.
