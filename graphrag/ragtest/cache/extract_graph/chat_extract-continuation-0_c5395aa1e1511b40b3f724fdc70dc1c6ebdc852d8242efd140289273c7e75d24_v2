For that reason, the copy should be as simple\nas possible—think “Eat Mor Chikin.” Chick-fil-A’s single line of copy is suc-\ncinct and single-minded, meaning that it has a clear focus and conveys only one\nselling point.\nAs the YMCAad demonstrates, advertising writing is tight. Every word\nSHOWCASE counts because both space and time are expensive. Ineffective or overused\nPart of a membership drive campaign, this words and phrases—such as interesting,very,in order to,buy now and save,in-\nad demonstrates how a copywriter plays troducing,nothing less than—waste precious space.\nwith language to deliver a selling point Copy is usually written in a conversational style using real people lan-\nsuccinctly and with style.\nguage.

That often means using\npersonal language and direct address. For example, an ad for Trojan condoms makes a pointed ar-\ngument on a touchy subject for its young, single target audience. Combining headline with body\ncopy, it reads as a dialogue:\nI didn’t use one because I didn’t have one with me.\nGet real.\nIf you don’t have a parachute,don’t jump,genius.\nHow to Write Effective Copy\nCopywriters revise copy seemingly a hundred times to make it as concise as possible. The tighter Principle\nthe writing, the easier it is to understand and the greater its impact. Simple ads avoid being gim- Effective copy is succinct,\nmicky, full of clichés, or too cute; they don’t try too hard or reach too far to make a point. The single-minded, and tightly\nfollowing list summarizes some characteristics of effective copy: focused.\n• Be SuccinctUse short, familiar words, short sentences, and short paragraphs.\n• Be Single-MindedFocus on one main point.\n• Be SpecificDon’t waste time on generalities. The more specific the message, the more at-\ntention getting and memorable it is.\n• Get PersonalDirectly address your audience whenever possible as “you” rather than “we”\nor “they.”\n• Keep a Single FocusDeliver a simple message instead of one that makes too many points.\nFocus on a single idea and support it.\n• Be ConversationalUse the language of everyday conversation. The copy should sound like\ntwo friends talking to each other, so don’t shy away from incomplete sentences, thought\nfragments, and contractions.\n• Be OriginalTo keep your copy forceful and persuasive, avoid stock advertising phrases,\nstrings of superlatives, brag-and-boast statements, and clichés.\n• Use NewsNews stories are attention getting if . . . if . . . they announce something that is\ntruly newsworthy and important. (In contrast, Post Shredded Wheat ran an ad with the head-\nline “Beware of New” in which it bragged about its original recipe that it had been using for\n117 years.)\n• Use Magic PhrasesPhrases that grab and stick add power and memorability. In comparing\nits paper towels with the cheaper competition, Bounty asked “Why use more when you can\nuse less?”\n• Use VarietyTo add visual appeal in both print and TVads, avoid long blocks of copy in print\nads. Instead, break the copy into short paragraphs with subheads. In TVcommercials, break\nup television monologues with visual changes, such as shots of the product, sound effects,\nand dialogue. The writer puts these breaks in the script while the art director designs what\nthey will look like.\n• Use Imaginative DescriptionUse evocative or figurative language to build a picture in the\nconsumer’s mind.\n• Tell a Story—with FeelingStories are interesting and they have a structure that keeps atten-\ntion and builds interest. But most importantly, they offer an opportunity to touch emotions.\nAn ad about two brothers, one with cancer and the other who became inspired to become a\nradiation oncologist, told their story as they confronted the rare cancer and turned to the\nMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center to help defeat the illness.\nTone of Voice To develop the right tone of voice,copywriters write to the target audience.
