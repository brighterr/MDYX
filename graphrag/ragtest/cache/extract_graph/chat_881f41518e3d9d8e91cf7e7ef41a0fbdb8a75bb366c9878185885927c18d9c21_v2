Ultimately, this information is\nused to decide who the targeted audience for the advertising should be. In an integrated\nmarketing communication (IMC) plan, the consumer research also acquires information\nabout all the relevant stakeholders and their points of contact with the brand.\n• Advertising researchfocuses on all elements of adver-\ntising, including message development research, media\nplanning research, evaluation, and information about\ncompetitors’advertising. IMC researchis similar, ex-\ncept that it is used to assemble information needed in\nplanning the use of a variety of marketing communica-\ntion tools. IMC is particularly concerned with the inter-\naction of multiple messages from a variety of sources to\npresent the brand consistently.\n• Strategic researchuncovers critical information that be-\ncomes the basis for strategic planning decisions for both\nmarketing and marketing communication. In advertising,\nthis type of research covers all of the factors and steps that\nlead to the creation of message strategies and media plans.\nThink of strategic research as collecting all relevant back-\nground information needed to make a decision on advertis-\ning and marketing communication strategy.

An\nadvertising plan goes through similar stages of\ndevelopment with research as the first step.\nWhat Are the Basic Types\nof Research?\nNew advertising assignments always begin\nwith some kind of informal or formal back-\nground research into the marketing situation.\nThis is called secondary research, and we’ll\ncompare it with primary research, which is\noriginal research conducted by the company or\nbrand.\nDemographic\ninformation, such as Secondary Research Background research that uses available published information about a\nthat available from the topic is secondary research.When advertising people get new accounts or new assignments, they\nU.S. Census Bureau, is start by reading everything they can find on the product, company, industry, and competition: sales\nfundamental to reports, annual reports, complaint letters, and trade articles about the industry.

As we explained in Chapter 5,\nU.S. Census Bureau demographic information of this kind is fundamental to decision mak-\ning about advertising targets and market segmentation. An advertiser cannot aim its advertis-\ning at a target audience without knowing that audience’s size and major dimensions. In\naddition to census information, other government agencies generate reports that help adver-\ntisers make better decisions, such as the Survey of Current Businessfrom the U.S. Depart-\nment of Commerce (www.bea.gov/scb).\n• TradeAssociationsManyindustriessupporttradeassociations—professionalorganizations\nwhosemembersallworkinthesamefield—thatgatheranddistributeinformationofinterest\ntoassociationmembers.Forinstance,theAmericanFrozenFoodInstituteortheGameManu-\nfacturersCouncilarebothorganizationsthatassistmembersinconductingtheirbusiness.The\ntradeassociationsformarketingcommunicationincludetheAmericanAssociationofAdvertis-\ningAgencies(AAAA),whichissuesreportsthathelpadagenciesmonitortheirperformance\nandkeeptabsoncompetitors;theRadioAdvertisingBureaupublishesRadioFacts,an\noverviewofthecommercialU.S.radioindustry;theAccountPlanningGroup(APG)conducts\nseminarsandtrainingsessionsforaccountplanners;andtheAmericanAssociationforPublic\nOpinionResearch(AAPOR)servestheprofessionalneedsofopinionresearchers.\n• Secondary Research SuppliersBecause of the overwhelming amount of information avail-\nable through secondary research, specialized suppliers gather and organize that information\naround specific topic areas for other interested parties.
