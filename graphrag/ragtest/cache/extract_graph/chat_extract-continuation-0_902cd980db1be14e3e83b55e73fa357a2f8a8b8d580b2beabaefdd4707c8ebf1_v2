While the renegade cows do not know how to spell,\nthey sure know how to sell “chikin” sandwiches for Chick-fil-A. And they’ve been\ndoing it for more than 14 years in the award-winning “Eat Mor Chikin®” campaign\ncreated by The Richards Group.\nBehind the successful cow campaign are copywriters who are responsible for\ngenerating the creative concept and writing the copy, or text, for ads. They un-\nderstand this ad lesson: At the heart of every piece of memorable advertising is a\ngreat concept. These creatives know that good copywriting is an art that sells. It’s\nthe job of copywriters to marry visual with the words to bring the concept to life.\nThey distill a promotional idea to its very essence and communicate it through their\nart. The really great ideas like Chick-fil-A’s renegade cows have sticking power be-\ncause they memorably connect with the audience.\nAs you analyze the “Eat Mor Chikin” campaign for Chick-fil-A, ask yourself why\nit has been effective for so many years. Let’s take a closer look.\nChick-fil-A started with a significant challenge: It had to persuade people to\neat chicken sandwiches when everybody else in the world seemed to be eating\nhamburgers. Chick-fil-A is not your typical quick-service restaurant chain, and nei-\nther is its advertising. Truett Cathy founded Chick-fil-A with the vision that his\nchicken sandwich company would be a leader in the quick-service restaurant in-\ndustry. Chick-fil-A has become just that, in part by understanding how to put ad-\nvertising to work to attract consumers’ attention and generate a response at the\nrestaurants.\nHere’s another important ad lesson: You do not have to be a big brand with\nmillions of dollars to have great advertising. The Chick-fil-A “Eat Mor Chikin” cam-\npaign is a great example. Chick-fil-A competes in the fast-food category, one of\nthe largest and most competitive industries. It is outnumbered 4 to 1 in store count\nand outspent 10 to 1 in media by the likes of McDonald’s, Burger King, and\nWendy’s.\nFaced with these disadvantages in the marketplace, Chick-fil-A and its adver-\ntising agency set out to develop a brand campaign that would increase top-of-\nmind awareness, increase sales, and earn Chick-fil-A a spot in consumers’\n259\n260 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nconsideration list of fast-food brands. To do this effectively, the campaign posi-\ntioned Chick-fil-A chicken sandwiches as the premium alternative to hamburgers.\nChick-fil-A defines its brand: “To choosy people in a hurry, Chick-fil-A is the\npremium fast-food restaurant brand that consistently serves America’s best-loved\nchicken sandwiches.” The copywriters crafted a campaign to communicate the\nbrand’s promise. And they did so by creating the beloved bovines that could do\nthe selling for them.\nThe company couldn’t outspend the competition. It couldn’t even afford a na-\ntional campaign on television,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRANDREVIVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BrandRevive is a campaign aimed at revitalizing a fading or unknown product to create a stronger consumer presence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CENTURY COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Century Council is involved in a case study related to the campaign \"The Stupid Drink\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICK-FIL-A<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chick-fil-A is a fast-food restaurant chain known for its chicken sandwiches and the \"Eat Mor Chikin\" campaign)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE RICHARDS GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Richards Group is the advertising agency responsible for creating the \"Eat Mor Chikin\" campaign for Chick-fil-A)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUETT CATHY<|>PERSON<|>Truett Cathy is the founder of Chick-fil-A, with a vision to lead the quick-service restaurant industry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAT MOR CHIKIN<|>EVENT<|>The \"Eat Mor Chikin\" campaign is an award-winning advertising campaign featuring renegade cows promoting Chick-fil-A's chicken sandwiches)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICK-FIL-A<|>THE RICHARDS GROUP<|>The Richards Group created the \"Eat Mor Chikin\" campaign for Chick-fil-A<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICK-FIL-A<|>TRUETT CATHY<|>Truett Cathy founded Chick-fil-A<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICK-FIL-A<|>EAT MOR CHIKIN<|>The \"Eat Mor Chikin\" campaign is a long-running and successful advertising campaign for Chick-fil-A<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
