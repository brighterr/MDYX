The re-\nsearch and analysis determined that Billings is a very spe-\ncial place that merges its location with an attitude—a\nposition that combines “open space” and “western pace.”\nThe important brand characteristics begin with its\nlocation—shaped by the Yellowstone River and sheltered\nby the Rims geographic formation. The community is\nprogressive and a regional center for finance, health\ncare, transportation, arts and culture, and diverse educa-\ntional opportunities. Its hard-working citizens have a\nunique Montana perspective that combines warmth with\nan appreciation of scenery and history. But what also de-\nfines them most is a lifestyle that loves the adventure of\nan untamed wilderness right outside the door.\nThose characteristics translated into a statement of\nBillings brand essence as “Montana’s city connects you\nto the authentic historical west.” The “trailhead” idea\nsprings from the recognition that Billings is a starting\npoint for business growth and development, as well as a\ngateway for opportunities to explore the wonders of\nMontana. The starting point idea was supported in the\n“trail” graphic with its “X marks the spot” symbol. The\n“Where Ya Headin’?” tagline expresses the idea that\nBillings is the gateway for adventure.\nThe campaign’s objective was to create a position\nthat expresses this brand essence and to create a con-\nsistent and cohesive brand message that unifies the\ncity’s efforts to encourage business and workforce de-\nvelopment, individual and family relocation, tourism,\nand community pride.

Campaign Management\n•Evaluation of effectiveness\n•Campaign budget\nThis outline is useful as a guide for the planning document, but more importantly, it identi-\nfies the key strategic decisions that guide various sections of a campaign plan. Decisions include\n(1) identifying the key problem to be solved based on analysis of the SWOTs, (2) stating objec-\ntives, (3) targeting the audience, (4) creating or reinforcing a position, (5) identifying the key\nstrategic approach that will deliver the objectives, and (6) using management controls to deter-\nmine efficiency in budgeting and effectiveness through evaluation. Let’s look at these strategic\nplanning decisions in more detail.\nSituation Analysis\nThe first step in developing an advertising plan, just as in a marketing plan, is not planning but\nbackgrounding—researching and reviewing the current state of the business that is relevant to the\nbrand and gathering all pertinent information. After the research is compiled, planners try to make\nsense of the findings, a process sometimes referred to as a situation analysis.The goal is to iden-\ntify a problem that can be solved with communication. As Fallon and Senn explained in their\n“Juicing the Orange” list, you have to start by simplifying the problem. The information collec-\ntion will probably be huge, but the problem statement should simplify the task.\nPrinciple SWOT Analysis The primary tool used to make sense of the information gathered and identify\nSWOT analysis is the a key problem related to a brand or product is a SWOT analysis,which, as we have said, stands\nprocess of finding ways to for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The strengths and weaknesses are internally\naddress a brand’s focused,and the opportunities and threats lie in the externalmarketing environment. In strategic\nweaknesses and threats planning the idea is to leveragethe strengths and opportunities and addressthe weaknesses and\nand leverage its strengths threats, which is how the key problems and opportunities are identified.4\nand opportunities.\n• Thestrengthsof a business are its positive traits, conditions, and good situations. For in-\nstance, being in a growth industry is a strength. Planners ask how they can leverage this\nstrength in the brand’s advertising.\n• Theweaknessesof a business are traits, conditions, and situations that are perceived as neg-\natives. Losing market share is a weakness. If this is an important weakness, then planners\nask how they can address it with advertising.\n• Anopportunityis an area in which the company could develop an advantage over its com-\npetition. Often, one company’s weakness is another company’s opportunity. Planners strive\nto identify these opportunities and leverage them in the brand’s advertising.\n• Athreatis a trend or development in the environment that will erode business unless the\ncompany takes action. Competition and economic downturns are common threats.
