Let’s consider two examples of ethical quandaries surrounding the ad-\nvertising of potentially unhealthy products to specific segments, such as targeting young black\nmen in inner cities with malt beer ads and children with commercials for sugary foods.\nOne of the biggest issues in targeting is the emphasis in many advertising programs on tar-\ngeting young consumers.

But the growth in the numbers of\nolder consumers has led to some resentment about the continuing emphasis on young people as\na general targeting strategy.

At-\ntracting value-conscious moms seems to be paying off. As a result of improving the clothing lines, stores,\nand merchandising and promotional strategies, the brand was able to build and maintain its strong value mes-\nsage, which translated into sales.\nThe Gap, Old Navy’s parent company, posted a 45 percent profit increase in the fourth quarter of 2009,\nthanks in large part to Old Navy success. Sales at the Old Navy stores that have been open at least a year rose\n7 percent.\nA key insight about the target audience and a clever campaign using some quirky mannequins that talk\nhelped Old Navy create positive brand perception in the eyes of the target audience: young moms. Old Navy\nsells more than inexpensive, cool clothes at a good price. Its brand sells fun. Old Navy’s President Tom\nWyatt said, “There are a lot of people that portray value, but no one portrays value with our quirky spirit.”\nA J.D. Power study revealed another sign of brand effectiveness. The study evaluated favorable online\nmentions of retailers by 22- to 29-year-olds and found that value brand Old Navy closely followed some more\ntrendy brands, such as Anthropologie and Bath & Body Works.\nOld Navy is starting to receive recognition for its creative work, as well. The National Retail Federation\nasked more than 9,900 consumers across the nation to name their favorite holiday campaign. “Super-\nModelquins” ranked high at number six.\nKey Points Summary\n1.What cultural,social,psychological,and behavioral in- graphics, psychographics, product-related behavior, and de-\nfluences affect consumer responses to advertising?The cision making.
