Most of the directories have been transformed into an electronic version accessible through\nthe Internet.\n364 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nOther Print Media\nAt this time, we don’t know what Kindle and its other e-book siblings will offer to advertisers,\nalthough there’s sure to be some angle. But books, even in print, have been and are being used as\npromotional tools. Anumber of marketing communication agencies have published books, for ex-\nample, that focus on the thoughts of their founders and the philosophies of their agencies: Crispin\nPorter(cid:2)Bogusky and Hoppla, Leo Burnett’s Leo, DDB’s Bill Bernbach Said,and Ogilvy and\nMather’s Ogilvy on Advertising.More recently a bank in Brazil presented 120 reasons why peo-\nple should be customers of Banco Bradesco—one reason per page. The book is at the center of\nthe bank’s customer acquisition program.11\nThe biggest change, however, may be coming in the form of the iPad, which may turn out\nto be the electronic savior of newspapers and magazines because its technology permits a larger\npage layout than ebooks. Wall Street Journalads, for example, helped launch the iPad with an ap-\npeal to download the WSJ for iPad from the iTunes App Store. Publishers hoped the new device\nwould restore ad revenue they had lost to online publications.12\nWHAT ARE THE OUT-OF-HOME MEDIA CHARACTERISTICS?\nOut-of-home advertising includes everything from billboards to hot-air balloons. That means\nads on public spaces, including buses, posters on building walls (barn roofs in the old days), tele-\nphone and shopping kiosks, painted and wrapped cars and semi-trucks, taxi signs and mobile bill-\nboards, transit shelters and rail platforms, airport and bus terminal displays, hotel and shopping\nmall displays, in-store merchandising signs, grocery store carts, shopping bags, public restroom\nwalls, skywriting, in-store clocks, and aisle displays. Even tall, highly visible grain silos have\nbeen recycled into huge Coke cans in Emporia, Kansas; a 50-foot fiddle in Green Island, Iowa;\nand a beer can in Longmont, Colorado. And don’t forget blimps and airplanes towing messages\nover your favorite stadium.\nIn addition to being one of the most creative vehicles for delivering brand messages, as the\nLATCH billboard demonstrates, out-of-home media is also a big and growing segment of the me-\ndia industry. Although total spending on out-of-home media is hard to determine because of the in-\ndustry’s diversity, this category ranks second only to the Internet as the fastest growing marketing\ncommunication industry.13\nWhy is it such a growth area? Out-of-home advertising’s defining characteristic is that it is\nsituational: it can target specific people with specific messages at a time and place when they may\nbe most interested. Asign at the telephone kiosk reminds you to call for reservations at your fa-\nPrinciple\nvorite restaurant, a sign on the rail platform suggests that you enjoy a candy bar while riding the\nOut-of-home advertising\nis situational in that it train, and a bus card reminds you to listen to the news on a particular radio station. As mass me-\ntargets people at specific dia has decreased in impact, place-based forms,such as outdoor, have become more attractive to\nlocations. many advertisers.\nOutdoor Advertising\nOne of the growth areas in the out-of-\nhome category is outdoor advertis-\ning,which refers to billboards along\nstreets and highways, as well as\nposters in other public locations. Of\nthe nearly $6 billion spent on tradi-\ntional outdoor advertising, billboard\nads accounted for approximately 60\npercent; street furniture, such as signs\non benches, and transit ads brought in\nthe rest.\nSHOWCASE\nThis outdoor board from the LATCH public service campaign was contributed An advertiser uses outdoor\nby Trent Walters, an account director with The Richards Group. boards for two primary reasons.\nFirst, for national advertisers, this\nA graduate of the University of North Texas, Trent Walters was\nnominated by Professor Sheri Broyles. medium can provide reminders to\nthe target audience, as the Olympus\nCHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 365\nsign illustrates. Asecond use for billboards is directional; it\nacts as primary medium when the board is in proximity to\nwhere a brand is available. The travel and tourism industries\nare major users of billboards directing travelers to hotels,\nrestaurants, resorts, gas stations, and other services.\nSize and Format In terms of size and format, there are two\ntraditional kinds of billboards: printed poster panels and\npainted bulletins. Printed postersare created by the adver-\ntiser or agency, printed, and shipped to an outdoor advertis-\ning company. The prepasted posters are then applied in\nsections to the poster panel’s face on location, much like\napplying wallpaper. They come in two sizes based on the\nnumber of sheets of paper used to make the image: 8 sheet\n(5(cid:5)11 feet) and 30 sheet (12 (cid:5)25 feet). The other kind is\nthe painted outdoor bulletin, which differ from posters in\nthat they are normally created on site and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STANDARD DIRECTORY OF ADVERTISERS AND ADVERTISING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A directory known as the Red Book that lists advertisers and agencies and accepts advertising targeted at directory users)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREATIVE BLACK BOOK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A directory used by advertising professionals that takes ads for photographers, illustrators, typographers, and art suppliers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRISPIN PORTER BOGUSKY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A marketing communication agency known for publishing books focusing on the thoughts of their founders and agency philosophies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEO BURNETT<|>PERSON<|>Founder of a marketing communication agency known for publishing books on agency philosophies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DDB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A marketing communication agency known for publishing books focusing on the thoughts of their founders and agency philosophies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILL BERNBACH<|>PERSON<|>Founder of DDB, known for his thoughts and philosophies on advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OGILVY AND MATHER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A marketing communication agency known for publishing books on advertising philosophies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANCO BRADESCO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A bank in Brazil that uses books as a customer acquisition program, presenting 120 reasons to be a customer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALL STREET JOURNAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A publication that used ads to help launch the iPad, appealing to download the WSJ for iPad from the iTunes App Store)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMORIA<|>GEO<|>A location in Kansas where grain silos have been recycled into huge Coke cans)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN ISLAND<|>GEO<|>A location in Iowa where a 50-foot fiddle has been created)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LONGMONT<|>GEO<|>A location in Colorado where a grain silo has been turned into a beer can)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRENT WALTERS<|>PERSON<|>An account director with The Richards Group who contributed to the LATCH public service campaign)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE RICHARDS GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An advertising agency involved in the LATCH public service campaign)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The university where Trent Walters graduated from)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHERI BROYLES<|>PERSON<|>A professor who nominated Trent Walters)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRISPIN PORTER BOGUSKY<|>LEO BURNETT<|>Both are marketing communication agencies known for publishing books on agency philosophies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRISPIN PORTER BOGUSKY<|>DDB<|>Both are marketing communication agencies known for publishing books on agency philosophies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRISPIN PORTER BOGUSKY<|>OGILVY AND MATHER<|>Both are marketing communication agencies known for publishing books on agency philosophies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEO BURNETT<|>DDB<|>Both are marketing communication agencies known for publishing books on agency philosophies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEO BURNETT<|>OGILVY AND MATHER<|>Both are marketing communication agencies known for publishing books on agency philosophies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DDB<|>OGILVY AND MATHER<|>Both are marketing communication agencies known for publishing books on agency philosophies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BILL BERNBACH<|>DDB<|>Bill Bernbach is the founder of DDB<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRENT WALTERS<|>THE RICHARDS GROUP<|>Trent Walters is an account director with The Richards Group<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRENT WALTERS<|>UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS<|>Trent Walters graduated from the University of North Texas<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRENT WALTERS<|>SHERI BROYLES<|>Sheri Broyles nominated Trent Walters<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
