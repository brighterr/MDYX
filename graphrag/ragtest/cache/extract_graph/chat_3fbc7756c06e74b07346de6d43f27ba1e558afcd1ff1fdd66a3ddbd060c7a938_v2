Esti-\nmates of nondelivery of third-class mail run as high as 8 percent. The response rate for direct mail\ncan vary from 0.1 to 50 percent, but it’s typically in the 2 to 3 percent range. The primary vari-\nables are the offer and target audience. Offers mailed to current customers generally have a higher\nresponse rate than those sent to noncustomers.\n496 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nBecause of the high level of nonresponse, direct mail is also a fairly costly tool in terms of\nCPM. It can be cost efficient, however, because it can be designed to reach a highly targeted au-\ndience with an offer of interest. It also is much easier to calculate the actual payout rate—at what\npoint do the returns of the investment begin to exceed the costs? That’s why it is considered so\nmuch more accountable than other forms of marketing communication. As summarized here, di-\nrect mail has a number of advantages and limitations:\nAdvantages and Limitations of Direct Mail\nAdvantages Description\nTells a story The medium offers a variety of formats and provides enough\nspace to tell a complete sales story.\nEngages attention Because direct mail has little competition when it is received, it\ncan engage the reader’s attention.\nPersonalizes the message Because of the use of databases, it is now possible to personalize\ndirect mail across a number of consumer characteristics, such as\nname, product usage, purchase history, and income.\nBuilds in feedback Direct mail is particularly conducive to marketing research and\ncan be modified until the message design matches the needs of\nthe desired target audience.\nReaches the unreachable Direct mail allows the marketer to reach audiences that are\ninaccessible via other media.\nLimitations Description\nNegative perceptions The main drawback of using direct mail is the widespread\nperception that it is junk mail. According to a Harris-Equifax\nConsumer Privacy Survey, about 46 percent of the public see\ndirect-mail offers as a nuisance, and 90 percent consider them an\ninvasion of privacy.\nCost Direct mail has a higher cost per thousand than mass media. A\ngreat deal of this high cost is the cost of postage. (However, it\nreaches a more qualified prospect with less waste.) Another cost\nfactor is the maintenance of the database.\nMailing list To deliver an acceptable response rate, the quality of the mailing\nlist is critical. It must be maintained and updated constantly.\nResponse rate Because of the changing nature of mailing lists, as well as the\ndifficulty of keeping relevant data in the database, the response\nrate can be as low as 2 or 3 percent. Even with that low response,\nhowever, database marketers can still make money.\nVulnerability Direct-mail delivery is vulnerable to natural disasters as well as\ncatastrophes such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\nDirect-Mail Message Design The functions of a direct-mail message are similar to the steps in\nthe sales process. The message must move the reader through the entire process, from generating\ninterest to creating conviction and inducing a sale. It’s all done with a complex package of printed\npieces. Most direct-mail pieces follow a fairly conventional format. They usually consist of an\nouter envelope, a letter, a brochure, supplemental flyers or folders, and a reply card with a return\nenvelope. These can be one-page flyers, multipanel folders, multipage brochures, or spectacular\nbroadsheetsthat fold out like maps big enough to cover the top of a table.\nHow the direct-mail piece looks is as important as what it says. The most critical decision\nmade by the target is whether to read the mailing or throw it away, and that decision is based on\nthe attractiveness and attention-getting power of the outer envelope. Amailing for Krispy Kreme\ngot attention when it created a coupon mailer in the shape of a box of doughnuts. Attached to the\nmailer was an offer to buy a box of a dozen and get another dozen free. Instead of the usual 2 to\n3 percent response rate, Krispy Kreme got an 11 percent response. The envelope should spark cu-\nriosity through a creative idea as the Billings mailer for its “Trailhead” campaign illustrates.\nCHAPTER 16 • DIRECT RESPONSE 497\nSHOWCASE\nThis envelope is used by the\nBillings Chamber of Commerce/\nConvention & Visitors Bureau to\nsend information about visitor,\ntourism, and relocation\nopportunities. It reinforces the\nnew brand identity campaign,\nwhich we described in Chapter 7,\nand carries the campaign’s\n“Trailhead” logo and slogan, as\nwell as the “explore” graphics.\nThe Billings, Montana,\n“Trailhead” brand identity\ncampaign was provided\nby John Brewer, president\nand CEO of the Billings\nChamber of Commerce/\nConvention & Visitors Bureau.\nA graduate of the University\nof West Florida,\nBrewer was\nnominated by\nProfessor Tom\nGroth.\nHistorically, the letter has been the most difficult element in a direct-mail package\nto develop and therefore the focus of much research. Over the years many techniques have proven\neffective in getting consumers to read a direct-mail letter, flyer, or brochure. Here are some hints\nfor writing an effective direct-response letter:\n1. Get AttentionTo grab attention or generate curiosity, use pictures and headlines that tout\nthe product’s benefits.\n2. Be RelevantSend the right message to the right person.\n3. PersonalizeUse a personalized salutation. If the individual’s name is not available, the\nsalutation should at least be personalized to the topic, such as “Dear Cat Lover.”\n4. Use a Strong Lead-InBegin the letter\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
