The ads for Sunkist\noranges and Harley-Davidson focus on tangible and intangible features.\n• Messages That TeachPeople learn through instruction so some advertisements are designed\nto teach, such as demonstrations that show how something works or how to solve a problem.\nEducational messages are sometimes designed to explain something, such as why it is im-\nportant to brush your teeth or get involved in local politics. Learning also is strengthened\nthrough repetition, as in the famous Pavlovian experiment where the dog learned to associ-\nate food with the sound of a bell. That’s why repetition is such an important media objective.\nPrinciple • Messages That PersuadePersuasive messages are designed to affect attitudes and create be-\nWhen advertising gives lief. Strategies that are particularly good are testimonialsand messages that generate word of\nconsumers permission to mouth about the product. Endorsements by celebrities (the Seinfeld commercial mentioned\nbelieve in a product, it in Chapter 7) or experts are used to intensify conviction. Selling premises that focus on how\nestablishes the platform the product will benefit the consumer, state a reason why, or explain a unique selling propo-\nfor conviction.\nsition (USPs) are persuasive, particularly if they provide proof or support. Torture tests,\ncomparisons, and before-and-after demonstrations also are used to prove the truth of a claim.\nConviction is often built on strong, rational arguments that use such techniques as test\nresults, before-and-after visuals, testimonials by users and experts, and demonstrations to\nprove something. Celebrities, product placements, and other credibility techniques are used\nto give the consumer permission to believea claim or selling premise.\n• MessagesThatCreateBrandAssociationsThetransformativepowerofbranding,wherethe\nbrandtakesonadistinctivecharacterandmeaning,isoneofmarketingcommunication’s\nmostimportantfunctions.Imageadvertising,inparticular,isusedtocreatearepresentation\nofabrand,animageinaconsumer’smind,throughsymbolism.Advertising’sroleistopro-\nvidethecuesthatmakethesemeaningsandexperiencescometogetherinacoherentbrand\nimage.TheSunkistadassociatedorangeswithcandytoconveythemessage of sweetness.\nCHAPTER 8 • THE CREATIVE SIDE 243\nThe Product\nTangible Characteristics Intangible Characteristics\n•Size •Style\n• Features MessageStrategy • Quality\n• Color to Represent the • Image\n• Durability Product • Prestige\n• Package • Warranty\n• Taste • Brand Name\n• Others • Others\nAdvertising\nMessage\nProduct Interpretation\nand Evaluation\nby Customer\nFIGURE 8.5\nTangible and Intangible Product Attributes\nThe diagram illustrates the characteristics of tangible and intangible features. The Sunkist\nad compares its oranges to candy but in the comparison it identifies tangible product charac-\nteristics, such as flavor and color. The Harley-Davidson ad uses intangibles—it associates\nthe Harley brand image with the personality of people who ride on the edge of life.\nAn association message strategy delivers information and feelings symbolically by con-\nnecting a brand with a certain type of person or lifestyle. This link is often created through vi-\nsuals. Aconsumer gets a feeling about the product—who uses it and how and where they use\nit—through these symbolic cues. Some advertising strategies want you to identify with the\nuser of the product or see yourself in that situation. Fashion and cosmetic products invite you\nto project yourself into the ad and make a fashion statement when you wear or use the product.\n• Messages that drive actionEven harder to accomplish than conviction is a change in behav-\nior. It often happens that people believe one thing and do another. The Road Crew campaign\nwas designed to overcome a gap between attitudes and behavior. Sometimes an advertising\nmessage can drive people to act by offering something free or at a discounted sales price.\nSales promotion, for example, works in tandem with advertising to stimulate immediate ac-\ntion using sampling, coupons, and free gifts as incentives for action.\nMost ads end with a signature of some kind that serves to identify the company or\nbrand, but it also serves as a call to actionand gives direction to the consumer about how to\nrespond, such as a toll-free phone number, website URL, or e-mail address. Marketing com-\nmunication can drive people to a website or to a toll-free number to call a company. Similar\nto the Road Crew campaign, another form of action is to discourage or extinguish actions\nsuch as smoking, drug use, or driving drunk.\nUltimately, marketers want loyal customers who purchase and repurchase the product as a\nmatter of habit or preference. Reminder advertising, as well as distributing coupons or intro-\nducing a continuity program (such as a frequent flyer program), is designed to keep the brand\nname in front of customers to encourage their repeat business.\n244 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nCREATIVE THINKING: SO HOW DO YOU DO IT?\nGiven how much we’ve been talking about creativity, perhaps a definition might be appropri-\nate. In a research review of creativity in advertising education, Mark Stuhlfaut identified the\nsignificant elements, which begin with novelty but include appropriateness. He says that\n“among advertising professionals, creativity requires singularity, uniqueness, adaptability, and\nrevelation of truth (the ‘aha’moment), which implies authenticity and relevance.” Stuhlfaut\nadds that if it’s creative, it is also often generative; in other words, it leads to other new ways\nof thinking.16 So creativity can be defined as generating novelty and uniqueness that makes\nsomething ring true.\nMarketingcommunicationandadvertisingare\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SUNKIST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sunkist is a brand known for its oranges, which are advertised by associating their flavor and color with candy to convey sweetness<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARLEY-DAVIDSON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Harley-Davidson is a motorcycle brand that uses advertising to associate its brand image with the personality of people who live on the edge<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROAD CREW CAMPAIGN<|>EVENT<|>The Road Crew campaign is an advertising initiative designed to bridge the gap between attitudes and behavior, encouraging people to act<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARK STUHLFAUT<|>PERSON<|>Mark Stuhlfaut is a researcher who identified significant elements of creativity in advertising, emphasizing novelty, uniqueness, and relevance<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUNKIST<|>HARLEY-DAVIDSON<|>Both Sunkist and Harley-Davidson use advertising strategies to associate their products with specific images and lifestyles<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROAD CREW CAMPAIGN<|>MARK STUHLFAUT<|>Mark Stuhlfaut's research on creativity in advertising can be applied to campaigns like the Road Crew, which aim to change behavior through creative strategies<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
