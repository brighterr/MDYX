The international product manager for one promotional\ncompany indicates that the number of clients seeking global incentive programs has increased\ndramatically. Some of the reasons for this growth include the interest of multinational corpora-\ntions in aligning all units with corporate goals, increasing bottom-line efficiency, and taking ad-\nvantage of the rise of the Internet.4\nMarketplace Changes Other reasons for the move to sales promotion match changes in the mar-\nketplace, such as these:\n• Consumer BehaviorShoppers today are better educated, more selective, and less loyal to\nbrand names than in the past, which means they are more likely to switch brands.\n• PricingConsumers have come to expect constant short-term price reductions such as\ncoupons, sales, and price promotions.\n• Market ShareIn most industries, the battle is for market share rather than general product\ngrowth. Sales promotion encourages people to switch products, increasing market share.\n• Parity ProductsSales promotion is often the most effective strategy for increasing sales of a\nparity product when the products in the category are largely undifferentiated. When products\nare similar, promotions become the tie-breaker in the consumer’s decision making.\n520 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\n• The Power of the RetailerDominant retailers, such as Safeway, Walmart, Toys “R” Us, and\nHome Depot, demand a variety of promotional incentives before allowing products into their\nstores.\nFrom the consumers’perspective, sales promotion reduces the risk associated with a pur-\nPrinciple\nchase by giving them something of added value such as a coupon, rebate, or discounted price.\nSales promotion reduces\nthe risk of trying a new Promotions typically offer the consumer added value, or “more for less,” as a Southwest Airlines\nproduct by giving promotion illustrates. Developed in conjunction with Alamo, the promotion promised those who\nsomething of added value fly Southwest and rent vehicles from Alamo that they could earn double Rapid Rewards credit to-\nto motivate action. ward a free flight—for a limited time, of course.\nSales Promotion Planning\nSimilar to advertising and other marcom areas, promotions are developed with a plan, sometimes\ncalled a creative brief. This summarizes the usual planning decisions, such as SWOTs, brand po-\nsitioning strategy, promotional objectives, targeting and consumer insights, budget, scheduling,\nand timing.\nAn example comes from the launch of Via, Starbucks’instant coffee. To demonstrate that\nthe instant product tastes like its regular brew, the company promoted a “taste challenge” that took\nplace at Starbucks stores on the launch weekend. Customers were able to sample a cup of brewed\ncoffee and a cup of Via to see if they could tell the difference. The event was promoted with tel-\nevision commercials and on social marketing sites.\nPromotional Big Ideas From this document promotional planners develop their ideas—in\nfact,aBigIdeaisjustasimportantforsalespromotionasitisforadvertising.Inmanycases,\nthepromotionispartofabiggerintegratedmarketingcommunication(IMC)plan,andoneof\ntherequirementsisthatthepromotion’sBigIdeashouldsupportthecampaign’screativeidea.\nFor example, Frontier’s long-running position as a different kind of animal is reflected in a\nshort-termpromotionalcampaigntochooseafavoriteanimalfromthespokes-animalsonthe\nplanes’tails.\nThe challenge is to come up with exciting, interesting promotional ideas that are involving\nand capture the attention of the target market—and that includes consumers, as well as trade part-\nners in the industry. One of the wackiest promotional ideas recently used was for the KitKat candy\nbar. It involves the use of religion, which is certainly novel but also raises some questions about\nthe appropriateness of the idea. Professor Karen Mallia describes the promotion in the A Princi-\npled Practicefeature and asks “Why religion? Why a candy bar?” Her answer: “Shock works—\nas a combination of norm violation and surprise. Religion is the last taboo. It’s one area creatives\nhaven’t heavily mined for ideas, because few clients are willing to risk offending people.”\nAs part of an integrated program, sales promotion has different functions than other marcom\ntools. For example, although advertising is designed to build long-term brand awareness, sales\npromotion is primarily focused on creating action. Marketing consultant Gerwin explains, “The\nobjective of advertising is quite different from that of sales promotion. Advertising is usually\nviewed as a longer-term investment. Over time, advertising builds brand equity by establishing a\nconsistent image or feeling for a brand.” In contrast, she explains that “sales promotions are more\nimmediate, involving a finite time period. Sales promotions offer the consumer something more\ntangible.”5\nWhat Are the Primary Categories of Sales Promotion?\nThe most common sales promotion strategies target the three audiences of promotions: consumer,\ntrade, and sales force. The first two—customer sales and trade support—have direct implications\nfor advertising and marketing communication and are the focus of this chapter.\nThe third category, sales force promotions, are also important in building trade support.\nThese include two general sets of promotional activities directed at the firm’s salespeople to mo-\ntivate them to increase their sales levels. The first set of activities includes programs that better\nprepare salespeople to do their jobs, such as sales manuals, training programs, sales presentations,\nand supportive materials (training films, slides, videos, and visual aids). The second set of activ-\nities deals with promotional efforts or incentives for retails to use as in-store promotions and other\nprograms that motivate salespeople to work harder, such as contests.\nCHAPTER 17 • PROMOTIONS 521\nA PRINCIPLED PRACTICE\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
