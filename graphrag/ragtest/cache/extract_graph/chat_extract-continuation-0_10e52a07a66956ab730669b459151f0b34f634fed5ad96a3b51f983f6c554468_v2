It also created a huge challenge for marketing communication creatives who\nhave to create breakthrough messages that will not get lost in the media explosion of the 21st cen-\ntury. The problem is that the more messages that appear, the less effective they are. Overwhelmed\nconsumers often respond by avoiding advertisements and other marketing communication.\nThe creatives’challenge is to create clutter-busting messages that engage and involve and\ntouch the hearts and minds of the audience. The ads accomplish this by delivering messages that\npeople want to watch, hear, and read. As clutter continues to increase and people take more of the\nmessage control into their own hands, the creative stakes get higher. As Professor Karen Mallia\nexplains: “Words and pictures—those are the weapons the creative team uses to produce com-\nmunication that breaks through indifference and inattention.”\nThe Tools in the Creative Toolbox\nEvery time media evolve, doomsayers predict the death of the current form. Today, some pundits\nsay the Internet will kill the print medium; others argue we will always have words on paper.\nStill others look at the growing domination of visual media and predict the utter demise of the\nwritten word, frequently with the old saw “a picture is worth a thousand words.” (Hmm, that\nargument is made of words, isn’t it?)\nAs long as human beings use language to think and communicate, words aren’t likely\nto disappear from advertising. Remember, the advent of acrylic didn’t stop artists from us-\ning watercolors, and television didn’t kill radio. And while styles come and go (modern,\nretro, skinny ties, wide ties, high waists, low rise), the tools in the advertising toolbox will\nall remain there for the deft to create magical things.\nThere’s no doubt that most marketing communication has moved from a verbal argument\nto a more emotive, visually based mode of persuasion. Look at historic ads on a timeline, and\nthe average word count drops with each decade.\nGreatadvertisinghasalwaysbeenfoundatthepointwherethevisualandverbalperfectly\nintersect.ThinkoftheheadlineononeofDDB’siconic1960sVWads:“Lemon.”Withoutthat\nKaren L.

It’s visually striking—yet verbally driven.

Writing dialogue for film and video is a particular\nkind of writing with a style and rules all its own. But the role of copy in video isn’t always that\nobvious. Consider YouTube’s most-watched brand video from 2009, Evian’s “Skating Babies.”\n(You can view it at www.youtube.com/watch?v(cid:4)_PHnRIn74Ag.)
