Ski mar-\nketers, for example, are using uploaded\ngeotargeted photos and videos to show real-\ntime snow conditions. Sprite is underwrit-\ning an interactive Web reality series on\nYouTube called “Green Eyed World,”\nwhich will follow British singer-songwriter\nKatie Vogel as she tries to break into the\nmusic world. Similar to the Gecko’s Face-\nbook page, the “Itsthegecko” YouTube\nchannel features among others, a video\nwhere the Gecko takes a different picture of\nhimself every day for two years. Check it\nout at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v(cid:4)\nLw_yEmdisfw.\nMajor broadcasters are also joining\nthe YouTube world. BBC was the first\nglobal media company to sign a deal with\nYouTube to provide news and entertain-\nment clips from its broadcasting. These\nclips also carry advertising. Other broad-\ncasters, however, are challenging YouTube\nand its owner Google for broadcasting their\nshows, which are protected by copyright.\nUsing time-lapse video, the Geico Gecko has a YouTube film where he\nThe media giant Viacom, for example, sued\nsupposedly takes a picture of himself every day for two years.

That is the idea that\na 3-D virtual world could become a playground for people who wanted to live imaginary lives on-\nline by playing social games.Sort of a parallel universe, participants created their own avatars\nwho were fantasy images of themselves—some even got married and set up housekeeping with\nanother person’s avatar.

Interest in Second Lifepeaked in 2007 when some 4 million people joined,\nbut it still continues with about a million people a month logging on. Second Lifeis popular enough\nthat some 1,400 companies and organizations, including IBM, still participate.47\nIn 2009 the action turned to FarmVille, a social game played on Facebook. It’s like a computer\ngame but rather than playing alone, you’re playing with friends. The idea is to grow crops either\nthrough hard work or by buying farmcash by trading and selling crops, exchanging gifts, and ac-\ncruing capital to expand your farm. The site makes money from ads and virtual goods that people\nbuy (with real money). Athird source of income is product come-ons, which are offers like those on\nwebsite ads, except that if you click on them, you are agreeing to try some product or service.\nSocial Media Strategies Marketers are experimenting to find the best ways to use social media\nand take advantage of the strengths of these new media forms. Marketers who want to use social\nmedia see value in conversations and customer relationship-building communication, rather than\ntargeting and promoting to a mass of anonymous consumers.\nFor example, Coca-Cola undertook an “Expedition 206” campaign in which the soft-drink\nmaker sent three 20-somethings to the 206 countries where Coke is sold. The 275,000-mile\njourney is documented on its own website (www.Expedition206.com), as well as through posts\non Facebook and Twitter (@x206), with image and video sharing on Flickr and YouTube. Fans\nfollowing the journey can send in suggestions for what the trio should do or see in the various\ncountries. Coke will track media impressions created by the undertaking, as well as posts by\nFacebook and Twitter followers, and website page views. One early success for the campaign\ncame with the internal communication and collaboration in planning between and among the\nmarketing, communication, and public relations teams. The event will also challenge local and\nregional markets to develop their own supporting social media tools; in some cases they will\nbe using media that were unknown in their previous campaigns.48\nResearch has found that search ads combined with social media campaigns generate higher re-\nPrinciple\nsults than more general search ads on portals and less-well connected websites.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
