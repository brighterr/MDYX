The important conclusion to the bigger ques-\ntion about how advertising works is that we know that advertising (and other marketing commu-\nnication) does work when it’s carefully planned and executed. It may not work in every situation\nand every ad may not be equally effective, but if it’s done right, then advertising can have impact\non consumer responses. That’s why the Effie awards, and other award shows that recognize ef-\nfectiveness, are so valuable.\nLooking Ahead\nTo a great extent, the impact of the recession lies in the emotional facet. Instead of snarly, sar-\ncastic, and cutting responses, researchers have decided that the recession ushered in an Age of\nNice—think bright yellow smiley faces. Graceann Bennett, strategic planner at Ogilvy &\nMather’s Chicago office, explains in a New York Timesarticle that her clients frequently critique\nad ideas by saying “we don’t want mean.”42Even Pepsi’s new logo in 2009 was characterized as\nlooking like the smiley face. Mocking ads worked to the degree that they tapped into people’s frus-\ntrations over the economy. Earnestness and altruism became the new face of consumer culture—\nand consumer culture is what we’ll talk about in the next chapter.\n“I love you, man” and “Have a nice day.”\nCHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 125\nIT’S A WRAP\nPitch Perfect: Ford’s in SYNC\nwith Singer/Songwriter\nDave Rodriguez, multicultural marketing communication manager for Ford, summed up the SYNC cam-\npaign’s ability to reach the Hispanic target audience: “Ford, SYNC and Juanes are just the perfect fit be-\ncause we’re all focused on the importance of being able to connect with people. Staying connected to friends\nand music while on the go is no longer a trend, it’s part of everyday life for our Hispanic target and SYNC\nbrings this power exclusively to Ford drivers.”\nWhen advertising is able to connect its audience with a powerful message about a meaningful product,\nit gets results. It built brand awareness of the new technology through experiential activities, which made the\nHispanic target audience aware of SYNC and educated them about its benefits. About 100,000 consumers\nvisited SYNC Zones at the Juanes concerts and almost 200,000 unique visitors visited the syncjuanes.com site.\nThe campaign successfully engaged significantly more participants than expected—about 63,000 regis-\ntrations and 30,000 hand-raisers who opted in for future Ford communications. Once the consumers under-\nstood and experienced SYNC, they were likely to move closer to a purchase decision. The campaign\ngenerated test-drive leads and test drives with a test-drive conversion rate of almost 30 percent (15 times the\nindustry average). For its excellent work, Ford and Zubi won a Silver Effie.\nKey Points Summary\n1.How does marketing communication work both as a form 2.How did the idea of advertising effects develop,and\nof mass communication and interactive communication? what are the problems in traditional approaches to ad-\nBy analyzing advertising as mass communication, we have a vertising effects?The most common explanation of how\nmodel for explaining how commercial messages work.
