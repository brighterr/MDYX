Some media plans are\nthe brand. specifically designed to generate excited talk about something new, particularly if the strategies\ncan reach influential or early adopters whose opinions are valued by others. One idea is that buzz\nis best generated by disrupting common patterns of thinking, or schemas. In other words, we talk\nabout things that surprise and don’t fit into our standard mental models.17\nViral Communication An online version of buzz, viral communication describes the way a\nmessage spreads on the Internet. Viral marketing strategies are designed to create a ground-\nswell of demand for a brand. However, the spread of messages depend totally on consumers cre-\nating buzz through their own e-mails and mentions on blogs, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.\nBrands can instigate the viral process, but not control it. An example comes from a McDonald’s\nFilet-O-Fish special promotion that runs every year during Lent. In a parody of the “Big Mouth\nBilly Bass” gag gift, a fish hanging mounted on a plaque in a garage sings, “Give me back that\nFilet-O-Fish.” The outlandish video has been viewed on YouTube more than a million times and\nhas spawned ads and even a ring tone.18\nOneofthefirstviralhitswasBurgerKing’s“SubservientChicken”whichwouldrespondto\ncommandstodothingsliketapdanceordoexercises.Thesiteurgedvisitorsto“telltheirfriends.”\nPraisedaspossiblythemostpopularmarketingwebsiteofalltime,thesitequicklyregisteredhalfa\nbillionhitsinthefirstcoupleofweeks,aswellasabigincreaseinsalesofBK’schickensandwiches.\nThecreativeteamexplainedthatBK’sadvertisingwasgenerallyseenasboringandthe“Subservient\nChicken”wasintendedtomakeBKmoreedgyandfun.Seethesiteandthestorybehinditscom-\nplicatedexecutionatwww.barbariangroup .com/portfolio/burger_king_subservient_chicken.\nAworry for planners is that viral messages can also spread negative stories or even be used\nto organize a boycott against a brand. As Simon Clift, Unilever’s chief marketing officer, ex-\nplains, “No matter how big your advertising spending, small groups of consumers on a tiny\nbudget might hijack the conversation.”19\nCustomer Service It’s not a new business func-\ntion, but it is new to marketing communication\nplanners who, in the past, were seldom involved\nin planning or monitoring this critical connection\nwith customers. Customer service represents a\ncompany’s attitude and behavior during interac-\ntions with customers. These interactions send\nsome of the most impactful brand messages that\ncustomers receive. If the interactive experience is\npositive, it will strengthen the customer relation-\nship; if it is negative, it can weaken or even de-\nstroy a customer’s brand relationship.\nThe importance of customer service as a con-\ntact point that delivers positive (or negative) brand\nexperiences is reflected in a campaign by online re-\ntailer Zappos.com that demonstrates to cus-\ntomers how its customer service representatives\nmake it easy to order or return merchandise.
