Radio copywriters imagine they are writing a\nmusical play that will be performed before an audience whose eyes are closed. The copywriter\nhas all the theatrical tools of voices, sound effects, and music, but no visuals. How the characters\nlook and where the scene is set come from their listeners’imaginations.\nAs an example of theater of the mind, consider a now-classic commercial written by hu-\nmorist Stan Freberg for the Radio Advertising Bureau. The spot opens with an announcer ex-\nplaining that Lake Michigan will be drained and filled with hot chocolate and a 700-foot mountain\nof whipped cream. The Royal Canadian Air Force will fly overhead and drop a ten-ton\nmaraschino cherry, all to the applause of 25,000 screaming extras. The point is that things that\ncan’t be created in real life can be created by radio in the imagination of listeners.\nThe Radio Advertising Bureau has used the slogan “I saw it on the radio” to illustrate the\npower of radio’s ability to evoke rich images in the listener’s mind. Research indicates that the\nuse of imagery in radio advertising leads to high levels of attention and more positive general at-\ntitudes toward the ad and its claims.9Even though we’re talking about imagery, it is produced by\nthe copywriter’s masterful use of the tools of audio as discussed next.\nTools of Radio Copywriting\nPrint copywriters use a variety of tools—headlines, body copy, slogans, and so forth—to write\ntheir copy. In radio advertising, the tools are the audio elements the copywriter uses to craft a\ncommercial: voice, music, and sound effects.\nVoice The most important element in radio advertising is the human voice, which is heard in\nsongs, spoken dialogue, and announcements. Most commercials use an announcereither as the\ncentral voice or at the closing to wrap up the product identification. The voices the copywriter\nspecifies help listeners “see” the personalities in the commercial. The copywriter understands that\nwe imagine people and what they are like based on their voices. Dialogue uses character voices\nto convey an image of the speaker: a child, an old man, an executive, a Little League baseball\nplayer, a rock singer, and so forth. Copywriters specify voices for commercials based on the\nevocative qualities they contribute to the message. Chicago radio announcer Ken Nordine’s voice\nwas once described as sounding like warm chocolate; singer Ray Charles was described as hav-\ning a charcoal voice.\nRadioadvertisingreliesonconversationalstyleandvernacularlanguage.Agoodradiocopy-\nwriteralsohasanearfordistinctivepatternsofspeech.Twoofthemostfamousjingleseverwrit-\ntenusedchildrensingingaboutOscarMayermeats.The“BolognaSong”usedalittlechildsinging:\n“Mybolognahasafirstname,it’sO-S-C-A-R.Mybolognahasasecondname,it’sM-A-Y-E-R.”\nThesecondbighitalsousedkidssinging:“OhIwishIwereanOscarMayerWeiner.Thatiswhat\nI’dtrulyliketobe.’CauseifIwereanOscarMayerWiener,everyonewouldbeinlovewithme.”\nSpoken language is different from written language. We talk in short sentences, often in sen-\ntence fragments and run-ons. We seldom use complex sentences in speech. We use contractions\nPrinciple\nthat would drive an English teacher crazy.
