Figure 19.2illustrates that process, and Professor\nStuhlfaut’s A Matter of Principle features builds on the idea of a cycle beginning and ending\nPrinciple with research.\nIf you can’t measure it, In addition to intuition and judgment, measurement that tracks consumer response is also\nyou can’t manage it. needed and can be built into a campaign plan as structured feedback, such as response cards and\ncalls. Often, however, the evaluation effort involves a more formal research project, which also\nneeds to be part of the campaign planning.\nPersonal insights into what makes an ad great are important, but why do we also need for-\nmal evaluation? The first reason is that the stakes in making an advertising misstep are high. By\nthe time an average 30-second commercial is ready for national television, it has cost about\n$200,000 in production costs. If it is run nationally, its sponsor can invest several million dollars\nin airtime. The second reason is advertising optimization, or reducing risk by testing, analyzing,\ntracking brand performance, and making changes where possible to increase the effectiveness of\nthe advertising. The third reason is to learn what works and what doesn’t—in other words, to iden-\ntify best practices so a brand’s advertising continues to improve.\nTypes and Stages of Evaluation\nEvaluation is done through testing, monitoring, and measurement. Testing is used to predict\nresults, monitoring tracks performance, and measurement evaluates results. In other words,\nfor major campaigns a sample of the ads is typically tested before they run as a way to predict\neffectiveness. Ideally, the results of preliminary evaluative research should be available before\nlarge sums of money are invested in finished work or in media buys.\nAs a campaign unfolds, the performance is tracked to see whether any elements need to be\nchanged. Sales may fall, or they may not increase as rapidly as expected. Is the advertising at\nCHAPTER 19 • EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS 581\nfault?

Furthermore, advertising effects\ntend to be delayed, so it’s difficult to link the advertis-\ning seen at one time to a purchase made days or weeks later. Exceptions are direct-response adver-\ntising and ads carrying promotional offers good for only a limited time.\nUsually advertising is measured in terms of its communication effects—the mental re-\nsponses to a message, which become surrogate measuresfor sales impact. Such factors as aware-\nness of the advertising, purchase intention, preference, and liking all suggest that the advertising\nmessage can make a positive contribution to an eventual purchase decision.
