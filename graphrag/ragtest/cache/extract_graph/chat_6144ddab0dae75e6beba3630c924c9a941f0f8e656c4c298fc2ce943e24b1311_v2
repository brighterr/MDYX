The standard of attractiveness is a socio-\ncultural phenomenon that both mirrors and shapes our ideals. Responsible advertisers, therefore,\nhave begun using models of more normal size and weight as a way to reduce the pressure on\nyoung people.\nDiversity and Stereotypes Athleticblacks,feebleseniors,sexyItalians,smartAsians.You’re\nprobablyfamiliarwiththeseandotherexamplesofstereotypes.Astereotypeisarepresentation\nofaculturalgroupthatemphasizesatraitorgroupoftraitsthatmayormaynotcommunicatean\naccuraterepresentationofthegroup.Sometimesthestereotypeisuseful(athletesarefit)andaids\ncommunicationbyusingeasilyunderstoodsymbolicmeanings,butsometimesthestereotypere-\nliesonacharacteristicthatisnegativeorexaggeratedand,insodoing,reducesthegrouptoacar-\nicature.Thisistheproblemwithportrayingolderadultsasallbeingabsentmindedorfeeble,for\ninstance.\nThe issue of stereotyping also raises the shaping-versus-mirroring question. For example,\nstereotyping women as sex objects is a practice that is deeply embedded in our culture, however\nnegatively some might see that value. Using such strategies also makes advertising a participant\nin shaping and reinforcing that cultural value.\nCHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY 69\nIntentionally or not communicators choose how they\nportray people in their ads. Whether you believe advertising\nhas the ability to shape our values and our view of the world\nor whether it mirrors society, communicators have a respon-\nsibility to ensure that what is portrayed is accurate and rep-\nresentative. Diversity has become an issue as advertisers\nstruggle to target, as well as portray, people outside the\nwhite, straight mainstream market.\nNext we discuss some of the most common problems\nfound in the way advertising portrays people.\nGender Stereotypes Stereotyped gender images abound in\nthe media—dumb blondes, the rugged western Marlboro\nman, and the clueless buffoon who appears in ads, comics,\nand programs as a bungling dad are all examples. One of the\nmost important lessons media teach is how people fit into\nculturally shared gender and racial roles. The way men and\nwomen are cast as characters in advertisements and pro-\ngrams can create or reinforce cultural stereotypes.8\nHistorically, advertising has portrayed gender in dis-\ntinct and predictable stereotypes. Men are usually shown as\nstrong, independent, and achievement oriented; women are\nshown as nurturing and empathetic, but softer and more de-\npendent, and they are told that the products being advertised\nwill make their lives less stressful and more manageable.\nMen are often negatively stereotyped as well. The organiza-\ntion FathersAndHusbands.org formed to promote positive\nimages of men in the media.\nAstudy of gender representation in 1,300 prime-time\ncommercials found that although women make most pur-\nchases of goods and services, they are underrepresented as\nprimary characters during most prime-time commercials, ex-\ncept for health and beauty products. Women are cast as\nCLASSIC\nyounger, supportive counterparts to men, and older women\n”Color Blind”\nremain the most underrepresented group.9 However, many\nThis was an ad created by the Carson/Roberts agency in 1964\nmarketers are recognizing the diversity of women’s roles.

Such images have appeared fairly extensively in mainstream fashion adver-\ntising for brands such as Calvin Klein, Benetton, and Banana Republic. The coming-out episode\nof ABC’s Ellenwas groundbreaking in more ways than just programming—it was the first time\nadvertisers used prime-time network TVto reach gay and lesbian viewers. Now it’s not unusual\nto see gays and lesbians portrayed as multidimensional characters on shows such as Glee,Mod-\nern Family,andGrey’s Anatomy.Viacom’s LOGO, a 24-hour gay channel, is supported by a host\nof national advertisers trying to reach this audience.\nRacial and Ethnic Stereotypes Think about sports teams like the Washington Redskins, Kansas\nCity Chiefs, or Cleveland Indians that reduce Native Americans to a caricature, and you’ll know\nwhy some critics claim that racial and ethnic groups are stereotyped in advertising.
