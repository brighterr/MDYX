Manufacturers also provide win-\ndow banners, free-standing displays, and special direct-mail pieces, such as four-color supple-\nments for the local paper that carry the store’s name and address. Other media used by retailers\ninclude banners, posters, shelf talkers(signs attached to a shelf that let the consumer take away\nsome piece of information or a coupon), and other merchandising materials, such as end-of-aisle\ndisplays and shopping cart ads. New interactive electronic kiosks with touch-screen computers,\nCD-ROM databases, full graphics, and product photos are moving into the aisles in many stores,\nwhere they provide more information about more products than the store can ever stock on its\nshelves.\nUnlike national advertisers, local retailers generally prefer reach over frequency since the\nmajority of their advertising is for special promotions. Because retailers can choose from many\nlocal media, they are careful to use media that minimize waste. That’s why direct mail is now the\nsecond-largest advertising medium used by retailers (newspapers are first).\nNewspapers have always made up the bulk of retailer advertising because the local newspa-\nper fits the retailer’s desire for geographic coverage and immediacy (although local businesses\nare moving some, if not most, of their advertising online and sites like Craig’s List are seriously\ncutting in to the classified advertising revenues). Retailers can gain some measure of audience se-\nlectivity by advertising in specific sections of the paper, such as sports (for sporting goods stores)\nand financial pages (for banks and loan companies), and in zone editions(certain versions of the\npaper that go to certain counties and suburbs). Free-distribution newspapers called shoppersare\nalso popular advertising vehicles for retailers, as are preprints,also called free-standing inserts\n(FSIs),which are placed inside newspapers.\nMany of the top 50 markets in the United States have at least one local magazine offering\nretailers high-quality, four-color ads to reach upscale consumers. Some national magazines have\nregional or metropolitan editions that also enable local retailers to buy exposure within their trad-\ning area only.\nNearly all major markets now have at least one local independent station and a public tele-\nvision station. The A Matter of Practicefeature explains how television advertising can be used\nfor revitalizing a retail brand image. Radio is used by local retailers because it has a relatively low\ncost, a high degree of geographic and audience selectivity, and flexibility in scheduling.\nCHAPTER 18 • THE IMC UMBRELLA 555\nA MATTER OF PRACTICE\n“Life Is Great” at SPAR\nDaryl Bennewith,Strategic Director TBWA Group, Durban, South Africa\n“All will benefit from united co- As SPAR continues\noperation” was the original phi- to prosper and attain\nlosophy Adrian van Well, the new heights, the com-\nfounder of SPAR, introduced munication strategy\nin 1932. will lead the way, en-\nToday the SPAR Group suring that the brand\nLtd. in South Africa operates stays relevant, excit-\nsix modern distribution centers ing, and forever young.\nthat service just over 900 SPAR In 2009 SPAR\ngrocery stores across the nation as achieved excellent re-\nwell as stores in neighboring countries. sults and continued to\nThe success of any business, as we create a lasting solid\nknow, is dependent on the brand’s ability to occupy a brand position—and\nposition in the mind of the consumer, which will moti- that truly makes life\nvate them to shop at SPAR stores. great!\nIn 2006 we began taking the brand in a new direction\nby building a position on a young, modern, and energetic\nplatform and gearing the marketing communication cam-\npaigns to communicate this message.\nThe first phase of the campaign was vibrant and atten-\ntion grabbing to match the “happening” concept, which set\nout to communicate that there is always something exciting\nand new going on at SPAR.
