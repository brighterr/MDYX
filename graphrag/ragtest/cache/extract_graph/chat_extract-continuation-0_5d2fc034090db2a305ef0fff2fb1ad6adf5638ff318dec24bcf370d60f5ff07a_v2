Teenagers don’t talk like 8-year-olds or 50-year-olds. of the target audience.\n276 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nMusic Similar to movie scriptwriters, radio copywriters have a sense of the imagery of music\nand the role it plays in creating dramatic effects. Music can be used behind the dialogue to create\nmood and establish the setting. Any mood, from that of a circus to a candlelit dinner, can be con-\nveyed through music. The primary use of music is a jingle,which is a commercial in song, like\nthe Oscar Mayer songs. Radio copywriters understand the interplay of catchy phrases and “hum-\nmable” music to create little songs that stick in our minds. Anything consumers can sing along\nwith helps them remember and get involved with the message.\nAdvertisers can have a piece of music composed for a commercial or borrow it from previ-\nously recorded songs. Numerous music libraries sell stock musicthat is not copyrighted. Acustom-\nmade jingle created for a single advertiser can cost $10,000 or more. In contrast, many jingle\nhousescreate “syndicated” jingles made up of a piece of music sold to several different local ad-\nvertisers in different markets around the country for as little as $1,000 or $2,000.\nOne of the most famous jingles of all time was the song “I’d like to teach the world to sing”\nproduced for Coca-Cola in 1969 by its agency, McCann-Erickson. Agreat example of a jingle that\nwas an instant hit worldwide, it later was recorded as a pop song without the Coke reference and\nsold millions of copies. Called “Hilltop,” the TVcommercial shows young people singing “I’d\nlike to buy the world a Coke” on a hilltop in Italy. Surveys continue to identify it as one of the\nbest commercials of all time. It is still run by Coke on special occasions and the sheet music con-\ntinues to sell more than 30 years after the song was first written.

The\ncopy for radio ads should use conversational language—as if someone is “talking with” the\nconsumer rather than “selling to” the consumer.\n• Speak to Listeners’InterestsRadio offers specialized programming to target markets. Lis-\nteners mostly tune in to hear music, but talk radio is popular, too. There are shows on health,\npets, finance, politics—whatever interests people. Copywriters design commercials to speak\nto that audience interest and use the appropriate music and tone of voice.\n• Wake Up the InattentiveMost people who are listening to the radio are doing something\nelse at the same time, such as jogging, driving, or fixing breakfast. Radio spots are designed\nto break through and capture attention in the first three seconds with sound effects, music,\nquestions, commands, or something unexpected.\n• Make It MemorableTo help the listener remember what you are selling, commercial\ncopy should mention the name of the product emphatically and repeat it. An average of\nthree mentions in a 30-second commercial and five mentions in a 60-second commercial\nare recommended, as long as the repetition is not done in a forced and/or annoying man-\nner. Copywriters use taglines and other key phrases to lock the product in consumers’\nmemories.\n• Include Call to ActionThe last thing listeners hear is what they tend to remember, so copywrit-\ners make sure the product is it. In radio that’s particularly important since there is no way to\nCHAPTER 9 • COPYWRITING 277\nshow a picture of the product or the label.
