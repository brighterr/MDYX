Although\nthere is some reluctance to say what is creative, most people have their own definition,\nwhich includes such dimensions as originality, appropriateness, and artistry.\nAlthough agencies offer an environment designed to stimulate creative thinking, profes-\nsionals working on their own find that the varied nature of their assignments and projects create\ntheir own challenges, as Michael Dattolico describes in his A Day In the Lifefeature.\nWhat Is the Role of Creativity?\nCreativity is a special form of problem solving, and everyone is born with some talent in that area.\nMedia planners, market researchers, copywriters, and art directors are all searching for new ideas.\nTy Montague, former chief creative officer and co-president at JWTNew York, made this point\nin a speech at the Effie Awards presentation. He said that even though the word creative is\nattached to his job, that doesn’t mean its use is limited to the creative side. Montague noted that\n“every client I have ever worked with desperately wants every facet of the development of a prod-\nuct and its marketing to be infused with as much creativity as possible.”3\n230 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nMontague points to Apple CEO Steve Jobs who, in his opinion, is “the current world heavy-\nweight champion in the marketing world and who makes sure that the entire Apple brand stands\nfor creativity.” In other words, when Apple launched iPod, “the creativity begins with the way the\nproduct looks, works, and feels.” And everything else is a creative challenge—packaging, distri-\nbution, PR, the events, the business model—it’s all creative. “Creativity was baked into the iPod\nway before the agency got involved.”\nHighly creative people range from Henry Ford, the father of the Model T, to Steven Jobs, the\ncofounder of Apple Computer, to Lucille Ball of I Love Lucyfame. They are idea people, creative\nproblem solvers, and highly original thinkers. Creative people are found in business, science, en-\ngineering, advertising, and many other fields. But in advertising, creativity is both a job descrip-\ntion and a goal.
