They evolve within the chapters as various IMC concepts\nare introduced and explained and come together as a set in a much revised Chapter 18, “The\nIMC Umbrella.” This IMC wrap-up chapter explains IMC campaigns and distinguishes\ncampaigns from the management of a Total Communication program.\n5. Language adjustment\nTo reflect this broader focus on brands and IMC, we also needed to adjust the language\nthroughoutPrinciples & Practice. In the Ninth Edition students will read about brand com-\nmunication, not just ads and advertisements. We still refer to ads, but only when we are talk-\ning specifically about that function. When we talk about the wider world of “advertising,”\nwe refer to marketing or brand communication.\n6. Creative chapters moved ahead of media chapters\nCreative thinking is a basic requirement in all areas of marketing communication. To\nemphasize that and to respond to adopters and reviewers who prefer to teach creative be-\nfore media, Part 3 now focuses on the creative side and message strategy; Part 4 focuses on\nthe media side.\n7. Rewritten and reorganized media chapters reflecting changes in industry\nIn our first point on this list, we mentioned the changes in the media industry; which\ninclude the growth of social media and the assault on traditional media. In recognition of\nthis new media environment, we have totally rewritten and reorganized the media chapters\ninPrinciples & Practice. The first media chapter, which is now Chapter 11, is completely\nnew. It provides an overview of this new media world with a special emphasis on the ex-\nciting new opportunities to engage with consumers. It also introduces the basic concepts\nnecessary to evaluate and compare media options. The second chapter is also completely\nrewritten and now combines all the traditional media in one discussion. The third chapter\nis more tightly focused on digital media; and the fourth chapter puts it all together in a dis-\ncussion on media planning and buying including, of course, the new media.\n8. New interactive and social media discussions\nWe note the special role that social media play in marketing communication strategies.\nWhat has happened is a huge change in the way advertising, both in its traditional and wider\nmeanings, operate. It’s a paradigm shift with the entire industry moving from one-way tar-\ngeted media to two-way interactive media. The idea that the audience is in control not only\nof what media they choose, but also what content they see (including messages generated\nby other consumers), means companies have to engage, rather than target prospective cus-\ntomers. And engagement means companies have to listen, as well as deliver messages. And\nlistening is much more complicated because it’s not just one customer calling a customer\nservice line, but rather sharing information online among family and thousands of “friends”\non social media, such as Facebook. Throughout Principles & Practice, the Ninth Edition\nrecognizes the impact and implications of this shift from company-controlled to consumer-\ncontrolled media.\nPREFACE xxi\n9. New Principled Practice boxes\nWe’ve added a new feature called Principled Practice. In previous editions we in-\ncluded ethics discussions in our Matter of PrincipleandMatter of Practiceboxes. In the\nNinth Edition we have designated a separate feature for these ethics boxes and titled it\nPrincipled Practiceto help students think critically about current issues in the industry.\n10. New pedagogical tools\n• Anew award-winning American Advertising Federation National Student Advertising\nCompetition (AAF NSAC) case for the Century Council appears in the Appendix, and\nquestions referring to the case were added at the end of each chapter.\n• BrandRevive is a new assignment at the end of each chapter that guides the student\nthrough the activities involved in developing a brand campaign plan, in this case for\nsome older, perhaps forgotten brand that needs a new lease for space in the minds of con-\nsumers. If students engage in this assignment continuously throughout the course, they\nwill develop a campaign plan for their portfolio.\n• Anew MyLab website for Principles & Practicehas been created. Content from the text\nhas been moved to this site to provide more integration between the printed text and the\nonline support materials and activities.\nWHY MARKETING COMMUNICATION?\nWe are using the phrase marketing communicationorbrand communicationbecause what\nused to be known as advertisinghas expanded beyond the familiar ads in print media and\ncommercials on radio and television.\nElectronic and social media have opened up new ways to communicate online with\nconsumers about a brand. Alternative and nontraditional forms, such as guerilla marketing\nthat reaches people in surprising ways in unexpected places, have opened up new opportu-\nnities to engage people with brand messages through memorable experiences.\nCreating buzz and dialogue have replaced the old\npractice of targeting messages at consumers. Anew\nThe Facets Model of Effects\ngoal is to enlist word-of-mouth conversations to rein-\nforce and extend the power of the more traditional\nmarketing communication forms.\nThis wider view of advertisingincludes an array\nof communication tools. We mentioned public rela-\ntions, direct marketing, and sales promotion, but those\nare just a few of the tools in the brand communication\ntoolkit. We will describe the use of these various see/hear feel\nforms of brand communication as integrated market-\ning communication(IMC), which refers to the strate- Perception Emotion\ngic use of multiple forms of communication to engage\ndifferent types of consumers who have an interest in\nor connection to a brand.\nSothetwomostcentralthemesforthisintroduc-\nthink/understand believe\ntorybrandcommunicationtextbookareeffectiveness\nandintegrationandtheywillbediscussedthroughout Cognition Persuasion\nthechaptersthatfollow.\nWHAT IS EFFECT\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
