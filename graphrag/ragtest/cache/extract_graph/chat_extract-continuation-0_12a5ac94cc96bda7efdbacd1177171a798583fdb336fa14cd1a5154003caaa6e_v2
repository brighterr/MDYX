Even Girl Scout cookies are trying to appeal to people by using new formulations\nthat are low in trans fats.38\nYoung people are particularly involved in trends. For example, the way teenagers dress and\ntalk and the products they buy are driven by a continuing search for coolness. Trend spottersare\nprofessional researchers hired by advertisers to identify trends that may affect consumer behav-\nior. Cool huntersare trend spotters who specialize in identifying trendy fads that appeal to young\npeople. They usually work with panels of young people in key trendsetting locations, such as New\nYork, California, urban streets, and Japan. Loic Bizel, for example, hunts Japanese super trendy\nfads as a consultant for many Western companies and designers. Through his website\n(www.fashioninjapan.com), you can get a taste of those cool ideas and fashion in Japan’s streets\nand life, such as studded high tops and spray-on stockings.\nCONSUMER DECISION MAKING\nAnother important factor in identifying a brand’s potential customers is the way consumers go\nabout making product choices. Acomplicating factor is the increasing number of choices. Brand\nvariations clutter shelves and media choices seem unlimited. Chicago agency Brandtrust believes\nthe consumer decision process is “a complex alchemy” set in play by product features plus con-\nsumers’past experiences with shopping in the product category.39\nCHAPTER 5 • SEGMENTING AND TARGETING THE AUDIENCE 151\nIn Chapter 4we looked at a number of models from a marketer’s point of view. Now let’s\nexamine them from the consumer’s perspective. The traditional view of consumer decision mak-\ning, which is similar to the more classic AIDA-based models of message impact, is based on a\nlinear, information-processing approach. It suggests that most people follow a decision process\nwith fairly predictable steps: (1) need recognition, (2) information search, (3) evaluation of alter-\nnatives, (4) purchase decision, and (5) post-purchase evaluation.\n• Need recognitioncan vary in terms of seriousness or importance. The goal of advertising at\nthis stage is to activate or stimulate this need.\n• Information searchcan be casual (reading ads and articles that happen to catch your atten-\ntion) or formal (searching for information in publications such as Consumer Reports). Ad-\nvertising helps the search process by providing information that is easy to find and\nremember. For low-involvement products this stage may not occupy much time or thought\nor it may be skipped altogether. Another way to describe consumer behavior in terms of in-\nformation needs includes such terms as searchersandimpulse buyers.Searchers are driven\nby a need to know everything they can about a product before making a purchase, particu-\nlarly major purchases. In contrast, people who buy on impulse generally do so without much\nthought based on some immediate desire such as thirst or hunger. Usually there’s not much\nat stake, so the risk of making a bad decision is much lower. It is true, however, that even\nmajor purchases, such as cars, can be made on the spur of the moment by people who are\nnot dedicated searchers for information.\n• Evaluation of alternativesis the stage where consumers compare various products and fea-\ntures and reduce the list of options to a manageable number. They select certain features that\nare important and use them to judge alternatives. Advertising is important in this evaluation\nprocess because it helps sort out products on the basis of tangible and intangible features.\nEven with low-involvement products, there may be what we call an evoked setof brands\nthat are all considered permissible. What are your favorite candy bars? The brands you name\nmakes up your evoked set.\n• Purchase decisionis often a two-part decision. Usually, we select the brand first and then\nselect the outlet from which to buy it. Is this product available at a grocery store, a discount\nstore, a hardware store, a boutique, a department store, or a specialty\nstore? Sometimes we select the outlet first, particularly with impulse\nLow Involvement High Involvement\npurchases. In-store promotions such as packaging, point-of-purchase\ndisplays,price reductions, banners and signs, and coupon displays af-\nNeed Recognition Need Recognition\nfect these choices.\n• Post-purchase evaluationis the last step in the rational process. As\nsoon as we purchase a product, particularly a major one, we begin to\nreevaluate our decision. Is the product what we expected? Is its perfor- Evaluation of Information\nmance satisfactory? This experience determines whether we will keep Alternatives Search\nthe product, return it, or refuse to buy it again. We referred to cognitive\ndissonancein the discussion of satisfaction and this is also an impor-\ntant factor in the post-purchase evaluation step. Many consumers con- Purchase Evaluation of\nDecision Alternatives\ntinue to read information even after the purchase, to justify the\ndecision to themselves. Guarantees, warranties, and easy returns are\nalso important for reducing the fear of a purchase that goes wrong.\nPostpurchase Purchase\nThis set of steps is hierarchical and suffers from the limitations we Evaluation Decision\ndiscussed in Chapter 4.
