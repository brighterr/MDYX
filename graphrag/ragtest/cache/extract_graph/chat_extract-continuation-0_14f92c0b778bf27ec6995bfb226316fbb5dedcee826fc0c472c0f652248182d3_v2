Airline magazines are a good example.\nBusiness magazines are also classified as vertical or horizontal publications. Avertical publi-\ncationpresents stories and information about an entire industry. Women’s Wear Daily,for example,\ndiscusses the production, marketing, and distribution of women’s fashions. Ahorizontal publication\ndeals with a business function that cuts across industries, such as Direct Marketing. In terms of ve-\nhicle selection, a number of factors influence how media planners fit magazines into their media mix:\n• GeographyMany magazines have a national audience, but some cater to certain sections or\nregions of the country or have regional editions. The area covered may be as small as a city\n(Los Angeles MagazineandBoston Magazine) or as large as several contiguous states (the\n360 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nsouthwestern edition of Southern Living Magazine). Geographic editions help encourage lo-\ncal retail support by listing the names of local distributors in the advertisements. Most na-\ntional magazines also offer a zone edition that carries different ads and perhaps different\nstories, depending on the region of the country.\n• DemographicsDemographic editions group subscribers according to age, income, occupation,\nand other classifications. Some magazines for example, publish a special “ZIP” edition for\nupper-income homes sent to subscribers who live in specific zip codes and who typically share\ncommon demographic traits, primarily based on income. Newsweekoffers a college edition, and\nTimesends special editions to students, business executives, doctors, and business managers.\n• Editorial ContentEach magazine emphasizes a certain type of editorial content. The most\nwidely used categories are general editorial (Reader’s Digest), women’s (Family Circle),\nshelter (House Beautiful), business (Forbes), and special interest (Ski).\n• Physical CharacteristicsMedia planners and buyers need to know the physical characteris-\ntics of a magazine because ads containing various elements of words and pictures require a\ndifferent amount of space. The most common magazine page sizes are 8 1/2 (cid:5)11 inches\nand 6 (cid:5)9 inches. Ads running in Reader’s Digest,which is a 6 (cid:5)9 format, allow for fewer\nvisuals and little copy.\n• OwnershipSome magazines are owned by publishing companies (Glamour,Brides,Vanity\nFair,andThe New Yorkerare owned by Condé Nast), and some are published by organiza-\ntions such as AARP\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PEOPLE MAGAZINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>People magazine is a publication that dedicated sections of its website to events like the Oscars, leveraging its viewership<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANITY FAIR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanity Fair is a magazine that dedicated sections of its website to events like the Oscars<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Entertainment Weekly is a magazine that dedicated sections of its website to events like the Oscars<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRED MAGAZINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wired magazine is a publication owned by Condé Nast, known for its focus on the digital community<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONDÉ NAST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Condé Nast is a giant magazine publisher that owns Wired magazine<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEREDITH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Meredith is a large publisher of magazines like Better Homes & Gardens and Ladies Home Journal, involved in custom publishing and digital campaigns<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KRAFT FOODS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kraft Foods is a major marketer for whom Meredith publishes Spanish-language magazines and designs digital content<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OSCARS<|>EVENT<|>The Oscars is a major event with immense viewership, second only to the Super Bowl<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEOPLE MAGAZINE<|>OSCARS<|>People magazine dedicated sections of its website to the Oscars event<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VANITY FAIR<|>OSCARS<|>Vanity Fair dedicated sections of its website to the Oscars event<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY<|>OSCARS<|>Entertainment Weekly dedicated sections of its website to the Oscars event<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WIRED MAGAZINE<|>CONDÉ NAST<|>Wired magazine is owned by Condé Nast<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEREDITH<|>KRAFT FOODS<|>Meredith publishes Spanish-language magazines and designs digital content for Kraft Foods<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
