Because it’s\nan action medium, it is also good for demonstrating how things work. It\nbrings brand images to life and adds personality to a brand. An example of\nthe dramatic, emotional power of television comes from one of the greatest\ncommercials of all time. Called “Iron Eyes Cody,” the Ad Council PSAwas\ncreated as part of an environmental campaign. It shows a Native American\npaddling a canoe through a river ruined by trash. Aclose-up shows a tear\nfrom his eye.\nAdvertising Sales The first decision in designing a television ad is deter-\nmining its length, which is usually 10, 15, 30, or 60 seconds. The most com-\nmon length is 30 seconds because for most advertisers, the 60-second spot\nis considered too expensive. The 10-second ad is like a billboard and sim-\nply announces that a program is “brought to you by . . .” the advertiser.\nESPN is experimenting with these “mini-mercials” and offering in-house\nproduced ads that combine an advertiser’s message with the lead-in to a\nshow. For example, in an Asics spot, a runner returns home and turns on his\nTV, which shows the ESPN “SportsCenter” logo with its theme song.36\nLong-form ads, which are of various lengths, are seen on late-night TV\nas “infomercials,” when the cost of broadcast time is much lower than at\nother times of day. Late-night infomercials have been the venue for direct-\nresponse television with its promise of how-to-do-it tools and vegetable cut-\nters, as well as get-rich investing. An interesting variation is found in rural\nIndia where traveling performers present live infomercials from mobile\nstages to a large and growing population of international brand-focused cus-\ntomers. Late-night informercial products like Snuggies and the Windshield\nWonder that clean the insides of car windows are also showing up in retail\nstores, such as Walmart, Target, and Bed Bath & Beyond.37\nThe actual form of a television commercial depends on whether a net-\nwork, local, or subscription service schedule is used.\n• SponsorshipsIn program sponsorships,the advertiser assumes the to-\ntal financial responsibility for producing the program and providing the\naccompanying commercials. The Hallmark Hall of Fameprogram is an\nexample of a sponsored program. Sponsorship can have a powerful ef-\nCLASSIC fect on the viewing public, especially because the advertiser can control\nThe “crying Indian” image from this famous the content and quality of the program as well as the placement and\ncommercial communicated a strong ecology length of commercials.

Several advertisers can produce a program jointly as an al-\nsheds a tear as people in a speeding car\nternative to single sponsorship.

(kab.org). approach, which is the most common one used in network advertising\ntoday, provides a great deal more flexibility in market coverage, target\naudiences, scheduling, and budgeting. Participations do not create the\nsame high impact as sponsorships, however. Finally, the “time avails”\n(available time slots) for the most popular programs are often bought\nup by the largest advertisers, leaving fewer good time slots for small\nadvertisers.\nCHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 381\nThe price of a commercial is based on the rating of the surrounding program (note the\nrating is for the program, not the commercial). The price is also based on the daypart during\nwhich the commercial is shown. The following table shows the Television Standard Day-\nparts. The most expensive time block is prime time.\n• Spot AnnouncementsThe third form a television commercial can take is the spot an-\nnouncement.Spot announcements are commercials that appear in the breaks between pro-\ngrams, which local affiliates sell to advertisers who want to show their ads locally.\nCommercials are sold on a station-by-station basis to local, regional, and national advertis-\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
