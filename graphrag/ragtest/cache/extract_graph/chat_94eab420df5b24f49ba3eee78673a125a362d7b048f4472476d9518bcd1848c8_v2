If you don’t like it, is there a return policy or\nguarantee that frees you from risk when you buy something for the first time? Providing in-\nformation about warranties, customer service, and technical support for technology products\nis an important part of brand loyalty strategies. The idea is to reduce risk and put the cus-\ntomer’s mind at ease. Incentives are also used in loyalty programs, such as frequent flyer or\nfrequent buyer programs. In addition, social responsibility and cause marketing programs\ncan build trust, respect, and preference that lead to loyalty.\n• Believability and CredibilityAn important issue in persuasion is believability,which refers\nto the credibility of the arguments in a message. Puffery or unprovable claims, such as the\ncommon phrase “9 out of 10 doctors recommend . . .” can strain believability. Related to\nbelievability is credibility, which is an indication of the trustworthiness of the source.\nSource credibilitymeans the person delivering the message, such as an expert, is respected,\ntrusted, and believable.\nBob Garfield, respected Advertising Agecolumnist, points out in his recent book, The\nChaos Scenario,that you trust messages from friends more than from any sort of commer-\ncial message—“anything dictated to you by Procter & Gamble channeling its marketing\nmessage through Mr. Whipple. . . .”34That explains the power of word-of-mouth and viral\nonline communication. Trust is also a factor in media choice. We watch certain television\nnews programs, read newspapers, and subscribe to specific magazines because we trust them\nas information sources.\nCredibility is one of the big advantages of public relations because publicity stories de-\nlivered through a supposedly unbiased news medium have higher credibility than advertis-\ning, which is seen as self-serving. However, advertising can use a credibility strategy to\nintensify the believability of its message. After the oil spill off the Louisisan coast, BPused\nadvertising to say that the company was committed to cleaning up the mess. The strategy\nhinges on the company’s credibility. Using data to support or prove a claim, for example,\ngives consumers a reason to believethe advertising.\n120 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nThe Behavior Facet: Act/Do\nWe introduced loyalty in the previous section on\npersuasion and noted that it intersects with behavior.\nBehavior can involve different types of action in ad-\ndition to trying or buying the product. The goal is to\nget people to act in various ways—to try or buy the\nbrand, for example, or visit a store, return an inquiry\ncard, call a toll-free number, join an organization,\ndonate to a good cause, or click on a website. The “I\nWant You” World War I poster by artist James Mont-\ngomery Flagg is a classic example of an advertising\nmessage that was designed to create action. It’s been\nused many times by other organizations to create\nthat same compelling message.\nWemustdistinguish,however,betweendirect\naction,whichrepresentsanimmediateresponse(cut\nouttheorderformandsenditbackbyreturnmail),\nandindirectaction,whichisadelayedresponseto\nadvertising(recallthemessagelaterinthestoreand\nselect the brand). There is also purposeless action,\nwhichbecameafadinthe2000swhenvirale-mail\nmessageswouldgenerateasuddenandconspicuous\ngatheringofpeople.Calledflashmobs,thesepublic\nspectaclesincludedaworldwidedayofpillowfights\ninpublicplacesin2008.Flashmobsdemonstratethe\npoweroftheInternetandbuzztoengagepeopleand\ndrivethemintoaction—eveniftheactionislargely\nmeaningless.Afauxflashmobwasfeaturedinavi-\nralvideoknownastheT-Mobile“Dance”wherepeo-\nple walking through London’s Liverpool Street\nStation spontaneously broke out in a 400-person\nchoreographed dance commercial.35 (Check it out\nA highly effective poster designed to create action, this ad was\nused during World War I to convince young people to join the at www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ3d3KigPQM and\nmilitary.

Factors that drive a behavioral response include mental re-\nhearsal, trial, buying, contacting, advocating and referrals, and prevention.\n• Mental RehearsalThemental rehearsalof behaviors is made possible by showing visuals\nof people doing things. As Charles Young explains,36one of the functions of advertising is to\ncreate virtual memories, in other words, experiences that we can imagine ourselves doing.\nVisualization is an imagined action, but one that is the predecessor to the behaviors with\nwhich the advertiser hopes the consumer will feel comfortable and familiar.\n• TrialThe first step in making a purchase is often to try the product. Atrialis important for\nnew products and expensive products because it lets a customer use the product without\ninitially committing to a purchase. In other words, the risk is reduced. Sales promotion is\nparticularly good at driving trials through special price deals, sampling, and incentive pro-\ngrams that motivate behavior, such as a free\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
