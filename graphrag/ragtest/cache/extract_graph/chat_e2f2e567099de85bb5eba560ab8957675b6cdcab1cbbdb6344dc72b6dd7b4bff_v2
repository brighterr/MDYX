The freakout campaign for Whopper’s 50th anniversary demonstrates the power of having a\nbrand identity so strong that customers not only remember it, but demand it.\nSo here’s the rest of the Whopper story. It’s a story of consumer shock and outrage: “If Burger King doesn’t\nhave the Whopper, they might as well change their name to Burger Queen,” and “What are you going to put\non the logo now—home of the ‘whatever we got’?” griped outraged customers. When one stunned would-\nbe Whopper eater was given a Big Mac instead, he said, “I hate McDonald’s.”\nThese comments were all captured on tape and played and replayed on the special website by intrigued\nviewers 5 million times. Fourteen million more watched it and the TV spots on YouTube. The agency figures\nthis all led to a 300(cid:2)percent increase in Web chatter about Burger King, which it estimates was about a fifth\nof the paid media. That means it received about 20 percent of the media for free as consumers spread the\nword. Burger King successfully captured its audience with a viral hit. Ad lesson #3:Smart thinking can help\nyou compete with competitors with bigger budgets.\nWas the campaign effective? Did the captivated audience buy the burgers? The answer: the quarterly\nsales increased by double digits. At the beginning of this case, you read about two goals for the campaign.\nOne was to reaffirm that the Whopper is America’s most-loved burger, and the other was to increase the sales\nof the burger. This campaign achieved both of these measurable objectives.\nWhat a way to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Whopper. To make the golden anniversary more\ngolden, the campaign was awarded a Gold Effie in the Restaurants category and the coveted Grand Effie, the\ntop award given to acknowledge effectiveness for the campaign’s “boldness and creativity across multiple\nmedia platforms, delivering real cultural relevance and above all, outstanding business results.” Ad lesson #4:\nAwards mean nothing if they don’t achieve the business goals.\nKey Points Summary\n1.What is advertising,how has it evolved,and what does it persuasion, as well as selling.
