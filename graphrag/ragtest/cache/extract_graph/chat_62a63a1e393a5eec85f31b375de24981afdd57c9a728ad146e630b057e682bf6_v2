Some ads are designed to make you feel negative about something (smoking, bugs in your\nhome, a political candidate). In the case of irritating advertising, you may even respond by dis-\nliking a brand or an ad, which may be a sign of a failed campaign. Have you ever seen an ad that\nyou positively disliked? How did that affect your attitude toward the brand?\nLook back at the Facets Model of Effects in Figure 4.3. Notice how perceptionandfeelsit\nside by side at the top of the model. Although this isn’t a linear process model, the perceptual\nprocess begins with perception if a message registers at all. That also means emotion is a driving\nfactor because it is so closely related to perception. Erik du Plessis, the CEO of a global adver-\ntising research firm, makes the argument in his book The Advertised Mindthat attention is driven\nby emotion.23He says our emotional responses to a message determine whether or not we pay at-\ntention. The key task of an ad, then, is initially to evoke an emotional response.\nThis view is supported by recent research in the neurosciences, which advertising professor\nAnn Marie Barry says “acknowledges the primacy of emotions in processing all communica-\ntion.”24She explains further that “Perception, the process by which we derive meaning from what\nwe see, is an elaborate symphony played first and foremost through the unconscious emotional sys-\ntem.” The important role of emotion in directing perception also structures our responses to brand\nmessages, particularly those that engage us on a personal\nlevel. For more on this subject, check out Barry’s comments\non thinking versus feeling in the A Matter of Practicefeature.\nFactors That Drive the Emotional/Affective Response\nEmotional responses are powerful, not only because they\ndrive perception, but also because, as du Plessis explains,\nthey determine whether our unconscious reaction becomes\nconscious—in other words, the ad breaks through disinterest.\nFurthermore, he suggests that positive emotional responses\ndrive memory as well.\nThe affective response drivers are wants and desires,\nexcitement, feelings, liking, and resonance. Emotion, then,\ncauses us to “feel” something. Another classic commercial\nthat has generated positive responses for more than 40 years\nis the Coca-Cola “Hilltop” commercial, which shows a\nmulti-ethnic group of young people singing “I want to teach\nthe world to sing in perfect harmony.” Aproduct of the anti-\nwar, Peace Movement, Woodstock generation, the 1972\ncommercial touched nerves, as well as hearts, and continues\nto get airtime, particularly on holidays. (Check it out at\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOEU87SBTU.)\n• Wants and Desires“I want something” implies desire.\nWantsare driven by emotions and based on wishes,\nlongings, and cravings—such as teaching the world to\nsing, which is a metaphor for peace. Impulse buying is a\ngood example of the motivational power of wants.
