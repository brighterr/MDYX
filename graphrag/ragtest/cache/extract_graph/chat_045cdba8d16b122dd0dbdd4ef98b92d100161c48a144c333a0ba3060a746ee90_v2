For example, a brand may be well known in one market, so its\nprimary objective, then, is reminder. At the same time it may be newly launched in another coun-\ntry, so the objectives there are awareness building and trial.\nTargeting Issues International marketers need to answer three basic targeting questions: (1) What\ncountries? (2) What level of market development? (3) Which cultural cohort groups?\n• What Countries?This is generally the easiest to answer because it is driven by where the\nbrand is distributed.\n• Market Development LevelCountries, especially developing countries, vary greatly in mar-\nket infrastructure, literacy levels, economic level, and level of media development. Some\ncountries’standard of living is such that luxury brands, for example, would not find a large\nenough segment of the population to cover the cost of setting up distribution and supporting\nthe brand with marketing communication and a sales force.\n• Cultural CohortsAcultural cohort is a segment of customers from multiple countries shar-\ning common characteristics that translate into common wants and needs. New mothers are\nan example. Regardless of their nationality, new mothers want their babies to be happy and\nhealthy. Teenagers are another cohort—teens in Tokyo and New York City may have more in\ncommon than a teen and his father.\nPositioningtheBrand Positioningisoneofthekeystrategicelementsthatbrandsusuallytryto\nkeepconsistentfromcountrytocountry.AnexamplecomesfromaVodafonecampaigncreatedby\nanArgentinianagency,Santo,whichwasidentifiedasAdAge’sInternationalAgencyoftheYear\n568 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nin2010.ForVodafone,themobiletelecommunicationbrand,Santoscameupwiththe\nline:“PowertoYou.”AdAgeheraldeditasasimple,directglobalideathat’seasyto\nadapttolocalcampaigns.22\nResearch is often conducted to identify the problems and opportunities facing the\nproduct in each of the international markets to be entered, as the Charmin commercial\nillustrates. Particularly important is a good understanding of consumer buying motives\nin each market. This is almost impossible to develop without locally based consumer\nresearch. If analysis reveals that consumers’buying behavior and the competitive en-\nvironment are the same across international markets, it may be possible to use stan-\ndardized positioning throughout.\nTheinternationalconsultingfirmAccenturefacedastrategicproblemwhenTiger\nWoods,thebrand’slong-timecelebrityspokesperson,facedallegationsofextramarital\naffairs.Becausehewassowellknowninternationallyandrepresentedthefirm’shigh-\nperformancepositionaroundtheworld,Accenturefeltitneededtoreplacehislong-run-\nning campaign.

When preparing a single plan for multiple markets, many companies use\nan objective-task budgeting approach that entails a separate budget for each foreign\nmarket. (Remember that this approach looks at the objectives for each activity and de-\ntermines the cost of accomplishing each objective.) This technique adds some flexibil-\nity to localize campaigns as needed. However, local practices also may affect the\nbudget decision. Most notably, the exchange rate from country to country may affect\nnot only the amount of money spent in a particular market, but also the timing of the\nexpenditures. The cost of television time in Tokyo is approximately twice what it is on\nU.S. networks, and, rather than being sold during an up-front market every spring, Jap-\nanese TVtime is wholesaled several times during the year.\nExecutinganInternationalCampaign Theexecutionofaglobalcampaignisusually\nmorecomplexthananationalplan.Thecreativemayneedtobereshotwithlocalmod-\nelsandsettingsaswellaslanguagetranslation.Languageisalwaysaproblemforacam-\npaignthatisdependentonwordsratherthanvisualsastheprimarymeaningcarrier.A\nteamoflanguageexpertsmaybeneededtoadjustthetermsandcarryoverthemeanings\ninthedifferentlanguages.ThePepsislogan“ComeAlive,”forexample,wastranslated\nin Taiwan as “Pepsi will bring your ancestors back from the dead.” KFC’s “Finger\nLickin’Good”slogantranslatedintoChineseas“EatYourFingersOff.”\nProductnamescanevenbeaproblem.InCanada,Mercedes-Benzfoundthatits\nGSTmodelnameisalsothefamiliarinitialsofataxcommonlyreferredtoinEnglish\nasthe“gougeandscrewtax.”\nRegulations, censorship, and favoritism toward local companies create barriers\nto entry for foreign companies trying to enter some markets, particularly China.\nCharmin continues to emphasize\nsoftness through the device of a U.S.-based technology giants, such as Google, Yahoo!, and eBay have been outma-\ncuddly bear, even in Mexico neuvered by their Chinese competitors.
