He explained, “From day one the marketing strategy, concept and platform,\nhas been very consistent—always positive, encouraging, and built around light colors. These two print ad examples\nwere part of an overall image/reminder campaign that has the company aiming for even higher positive ratings.\nSORPA is now maintaining over a 90 percent positive rating.”\nA graduate of the University of West Florida, Ingvi Logason was nominated by Professor Tom Groth.\nFund-Raising\nOne activity that almost all nonprofits do is fund-raising,sometimes called development,often\nunder the guidance of a development officer who is a professional specializing in fund-raising.\nGroups such as Save the Children and the Nature Conservancy use sophisticated segmentation\nand message strategies to target audiences and raise funds.\nUniversitiesandotherorganizationssuchasmuseumsandhospitalsusecapitalcampaigns\ndesignedtoraiseaspecifiedamountofmoneyinasettimeframetofinancenewbuildings,equip-\nmentpurchases,andotherprograms.Thesecampaignsoperatewithacarefullydesignedstrategy\nthatinvolvessophisticatedmotivationstrategiesbasedonsegmentation,targeting,goalsetting,\nandleadershipidentification.Events,directmarketing,andcampaignliteratureareimportanttac-\nticaltools.\nSocial Marketing and Public Communication\nThe use of marketing programs and marketing communication tools to create awareness of a so-\ncial need is called social marketing.It is also used to motivate consumers and businesses to act\nin certain ways, such as give money, volunteer time, or adopt certain policies. The anti-smoking\nand antidrug campaigns are examples of social marketing.\nSocial marketing is also called public communication. Public communication campaigns\nare undertaken by nonprofit organizations as a conscious effort to influence the thoughts or ac-\ntions of the public. The biggest and longest running program is the Advertising Council, which is\na network of advertising agencies, media, and suppliers that donate their services to create ads\nand campaigns on behalf of socially important causes: crime prevention, child abuse, mental ill-\nCHAPTER 18 • THE IMC UMBRELLA 561\nness, and the environment. The “Smoky Bear” fire prevention effort is one of the longest running\nand best-known Ad Council campaigns.\nAnother example comes from Jeremy Boland, art director at Borders Perrin Norrander in\nPortland, Oregon, who contributed a campaign that he directed from the 2008 presidential cam-\npaign. It’s an example of integrated planning for a public communication effort. You can see the\n“Things Are Fine” campaign at www.thingsarefine.org. Boland describes the effort as “a hugely\nimpactful campaign to get the youth demographic out and vote in this last presidential election.”\nBoland said it was “overwhelming how well received on a global level it was” and it has been de-\nscribed as “one of the most memorable campaigns from the election.”\nCause and Mission Marketing\nAn annual study, the Edelman Consumer Study, found that almost 60 percent of the world’s con-\nsumers do business with a company because it supports good causes.\nConcern for social issues is increasingly important for for-profit companies because they\nwant to be seen as socially responsible. Pepsi, for example, launched the Pepsi “refresh project”\ndedicating at least $20 million in 2010 to nonprofits and causes consumers propose on the cam-\npaign’s website (www.refresheverything.com). Visitors can vote on the ideas suggested during the\nprevious month. Amedia blitz to announce the effort included appearances by Kevin Bacon and\nDemi Moore on NBC’s Today Show, ads on other broadcast networks, and messages on AOL,\nFacebook, Hulu, MTV, Parade, and Yahoo!.16\nAdoptingagoodcauseandhelpinginitsfund-raisingandothercommunity-orientedefforts\niscalledcausemarketing.Forexample,WalmartwasanearlyrespondertotheHurricaneKat-\nrinadisasterwithtruckloadsofwateraswellasspecialplacementhelpforitsemployeeswhowere\naffected.Targethasdonatedahugeamountofmoneytoitslocalcommunitiesaspartofitscom-\nmunitycaringeffort.CarolCone,founderoftheConeagency,whichspecializesincausemar-\nketing,callstheseeffortspassionbrandingbecausetheylinkbrandstocausesforwhichpeople\nfeel passion.
