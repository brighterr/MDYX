These variables include the price, the cost of shipping and handling, optional features,\nfuture obligations, availability of credit, extra incentives, time and quality limits, and guarantees\nor warranties. The offer is supported by a message strategy, a media strategy, and the database.\nMessageandMediaStrategy DMCmessagesareoftenlongerandcontainmoreexplanationand\ndetailbecauseasstatedbefore,ifthismessagedoesn’tprovideenoughinformationandmotivate\nthereceivertorespondtoitinsomeway,themessageiswasted.Tobepersuasive,messagesmust\ncontainclearcomparisonsordetailsaboutdecisionfactors,suchasprice,style,andconvenience.\nBecause DMC messages can be individually targeted, the more personalized the message the\nbetter. For example, when a customer orders a book from Amazon.com, the company’s system\nimmediately suggests similar books. When one of the airlines sends out promotional offers to its\nfrequent flyers, these messages often show the number of miles traveled in the past year and the\nnumber of rewards earned year to date. This is obviously a personalized message and definitely\nattracts more attention.\nADMC message should reflect whether the offer is a one-step offer or two-step offer. Be-\ncause a one-step offerasks for a direct sale response, it must include a mechanism for respond-\ning to the offer. Atwo-step offeris designed to gather leads, answer consumer questions, set up\nappointments, and drive customers to a website or retail store.\nFinally the message needs to counter consumers’ reluctance to buy. Buying something\nthrough direct marketing has elements of risk because there is no salesperson or store to rely on\nfor assistance and information. Most direct-response messages will include copy intended to put\nthe buyer’s mind at rest. Guarantees and warranties are important, but another strategy was used\nin a GEICO flyer to newspaper subscribers, and also in similar looking ads in the business press,\nto reassure buyers about the company’s reliability.\nThe Response/Order Generating a response is the third step in the direct marketing process (see\nFigure 16.2). To maximize the response/order rate, the DMC message must make it as easy as\npossible for customers to respond. One way to do this is to offer a variety of ways in which to\n494 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nMorethanjustalightheartedlizard,TheGeckoissmartenoughtodeliverareassuring\nmessagetojitteryconsumersinaneconomicdownturnthatGEICOisfinanciallystable,even\nmentioninginvestmentgiantandcorporateownerWarrenBuffettandhisBerkshireHathaway\ncompanyintheflyer.\nrespond—online, mail, phone, and fax. Also, if phone is one channel, then the more hours the\nphone lines are open, the better. When customers respond online, it is important that the company\nimmediately acknowledge the response, thanking the customer for the order and advising when\nthe product will arrive. The types of customer service offered, such as toll-free telephone num-\nbers for product support, free limited-time trials, and acceptance of several different credit cards,\nare important techniques for overcoming customer resistance to responding. To create urgency,\nthe direct marketing message may also include a promotional device such as a gift or limited-\ntime-only price deal.\nFulfillment and Customer Follow-Up The next step in the direct marketing process is called\nfulfillment,which is responding to customers’responses by getting the product to those who or-\nder it. Fulfillment includes all of the back-end activities of processing the transaction, including\ndelivering the product, receiving payment, and providing customers with tracking numbers so\nthey can trace the delivery of their orders.
