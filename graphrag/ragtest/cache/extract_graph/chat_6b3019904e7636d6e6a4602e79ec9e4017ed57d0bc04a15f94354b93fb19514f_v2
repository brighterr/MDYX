Burger King knows its core demographic (its biggest\ngroup of consumers) is 18- to24-year-old males, and it sure knows how to connect\nwith those dudes. Past promotional efforts included sponsorships with the Na-\ntional Football League and NASCAR and tie-ins with The Simpsons Movie. Its\nchicken sandwich was launched with the “Subservient Chicken” website. Who\ncould forget the creepy King mascot who shows up in weird places? The Whopper\ncommands a loyal and passionate following from those who love the weird—and\nwho aren’t counting calories.\nTo grab the attention of Whopper lovers, CPB came up with a big idea, a prank.\nIt devised an experiment that deprived consumers of their beloved Whopper—\nsomething that hadn’t been done before in the burger war. To enact the deprivation\n5\n6 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nstrategy, the agency took over a Burger King in Las Vegas for a single day and video-\ntaped with hidden cameras the reactions of consumers who were either told that\nWhoppers had been permanently removed from the BK menu or given a competi-\ntor’s burger such as a Big Mac or Wendy burger instead of a Whopper.\nActorswereusedasBurgerKingemployees,butrealconsumers—notactors—\nreacted to the bad burger news.

But what made it successful? In the Part 1opener\nwe made the point that, in spite of economic downturns, the basic principles remain important.\nThe Burger King story demonstrates the importance of a dramatic idea, as well as the power of\nword of mouth. In this chapter we’ll define advertising and its role in marketing communication,\nexplain how its basic concepts and practices evolved, and describe the agency world. We’ll con-\nclude by analyzing the changes facing marketing communication.\nWHAT IS ADVERTISING?\nYou’ve seen thousands, maybe millions of commercial messages, so how would you define ad-\nvertising, which is the most visible of all the forms of marketing communication that we will be\ndiscussing in this book? It may sound silly to ask such an obvious question. But where would you\nstart if your instructor asked you for a definition of advertising?\nAt its most basic, the purpose of advertising has always been to sell a product,which can be\ngoods, services, or ideas. Although there have been major changes in recent years from dying\nprint media to merging and converging digital forms, the basics of advertising, as we said in the\nPart 1opener, are even more important in turbulent times. To better understand advertising’s de-\nvelopment as a commercial form of communication, it helps to understand how advertising’s def-\ninition and its basic roles have evolved over the years.\n• IdentificationAdvertising identifies a product and/or the store where it’s sold. In its earliest\nyears, and this goes back as far as ancient times, advertising focused on identifying a prod-\nuct and where it was sold. Some of the earliest ads were simply signs with the name or\ngraphic image of the type of store—cobbler, grocer, or blacksmith.\n• InformationAdvertising provides information about a product. Advances in printing tech-\nnology at the beginning of the Renaissance spurred literacy and brought an explosion of\nprinted materials in the form of posters, handbills, and newspapers. Literacy was no longer\nthe badge of the elite and it was possible to reach a general audience with more detailed in-\nformation about products. The word advertisementfirst appeared around 1655, and by\n1660 publishers were using the word as a heading in newspapers for commercial informa-\ntion. These messages announced land for sale, runaways (slaves and servants), transporta-\ntion (ships arriving, stagecoach schedules), and goods for sale from local merchants.\nCHAPTER 1 • THE NEW WORLD OF MARKETING COMMUNICATION 7\nBecause of the importance of commercial information, these ads were\nconsidered news\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
