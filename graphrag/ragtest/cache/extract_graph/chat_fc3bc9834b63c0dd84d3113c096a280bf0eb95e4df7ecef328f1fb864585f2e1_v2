(MRI).\nThese two organizations survey large samples of American consumers (approxi-\nmately 30,000 for each survey) and ask questions about the consumption, possession, or use of a\nwide range of products, services, and media. The products and services covered in the MRI survey\nrange from toothbrushes and dental floss to diet colas, camping equipment, and theme parks.\nBoth SMRB and MRI conduct original research and distribute their findings to their clients.\nThe resulting reports are intended primarily for use in media planning, but because these surveys\nare so comprehensive, they also can be mined for unique consumer information. Through a com-\nputer program called Golddigger, for example, an MRI subscriber can select a consumer target\nand ask the computer to find all other products and services and all of the media that members\nof the target segment use. This profile provides a vivid and detailed description of the target as\na person—just the information creative teams need to help them envision their audiences.
