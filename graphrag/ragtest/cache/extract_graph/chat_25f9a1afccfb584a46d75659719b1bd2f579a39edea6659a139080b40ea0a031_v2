National retailers try\nto develop offers that appeal to consumers in different parts of the country, as well as in different\nneighborhoods. H.E.B. Supermarkets operates its stores in both central and south Texas. In San\nAntonio, the stores located in Mexican-American neighborhoods have a very different merchan-\ndise assortment, as well as different advertising than do its stores in other locations. Sometimes\nspecial sales are used to reach special target audiences as the Virgin “Forever 70s” sale demon-\nstrates, which has some fun with the type of person who might be interested in 70s music.\nCooperative Advertising\nOne way local retailers can compensate for their smaller advertising budgets and limited exper-\ntise is to take advantage of cooperative (co-op) advertising(Chapters 2, 8, 12, and 17), in which\nthe national brand reimburses the retailer for part or all of the advertising expenses. Also called\nad allowancesorpromotional allowances,these co-op funds have become so common that most\nretailers won’t even consider taking on a new brand, especially one in a heavily advertised cate-\ngory, without receiving some support. Large drug and discount chains periodically produce spe-\ncial advertising supplements. Their suppliers are offered an opportunity to buy space in these\nsupplements. The result is that much or all of retail advertising is paid for by the brands carried\nin the advertising.\nCHAPTER 18 • THE IMC UMBRELLA 553\nSHOWCASE\nFor Virgin Megastore’s “Forever 70s” sale, Chris Hutchinson came up with the idea of a character who was stuck in the 70s—his music,\nhis style, his lingo, his attitude. Where to find this cool cat? The perfect person turned out to be the art director himself who worked\nout a great outfit—a huge Afro, tight bellbottoms, and an orange leather jacket that his father wore in the real 1970s. The\nphotographer shot on the run to get a semi-documentary look. The client loved the print so the art director directed\nhimself in a set of TV spots, as well. The sale was a huge success nationwide.\nA graduate of the University of Oregon’s advertising program, Chris Hutchinson was nominated for\ninclusion in this book by Professor Charles Frazer.\nCreating the Retail Ad\nPrior to actually writing copy or drawing a layout, creative advertising experts Jeweler and\nDrewniany suggest that advertisers answer this question: Why would you shop in your store? Pos-\nsible answers to this question can provide direction for the creative process. They suggest these\ntypical reasons:11\n• Store’s personnel\n• Store’s location\n• Store’s pricing policy\n• Store’s products\n• Store’s history\n• Store’s stand on social responsibility issues.\nPrice,forexample,canbeafactorinestablishingastore’simageandareasonforshopping.\nMostdiscountstoressignaltheirtypeofmerchandisewithlarge,boldprices.Otherretailersem-\nphasizepricebyofferingcouponsintheirprintadvertising.Featuringpricesdoesn’tnecessarily\napplyonlytoadsthatgivethestoreabargainoradiscountimage,however.Pricecanhelpthe\nconsumercomparisonshopwithoutvisitingthestore.DiscounterslikeTargetandWalmartalso\nuseaprice-valuestrategythatsuggeststheyofferthebestqualityyoucangetforthatpricelevel.\nBecause the main object of retail ads is to attract customers, store location (or telephone\nnumber, if advertising is a service) is essential. For merchandise that is infrequently purchased,\nsuch as cars, furniture, wallpaper, and hearing aids, the ad should include a map or mention a\n554 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\ngeographic reference point (for example, three blocks north of the state capitol building) in addi-\ntion to the regular street address.\nMost retail advertising is created and produced by one or a combination of the following: in-\nhouse staff, local media, ad agencies, and/or freelancers. The larger the retail operation, the more\nlikely it is to have an in-house advertising staff because few outside agencies are prepared to han-\ndle the large number of day-to-day copy changes and the fast deadlines that are typical of major\nretail advertising.\nIn the case of national chains and franchises, the national headquarters provides ad formats,\nTVcommercials, and radio spots, all of which can be localized. All local media also are willing\nto create and produce ads for retailers as a way to get them to use their media. With the exception\nof television stations, most provide this service free.\nLocal retailers will sometimes use local agencies to create a campaign they can run over\ntime. If successful, as the Virgin story illustrates, the creative idea may become a national cam-\npaign. Generally outside agency work is the most costly way to produce retail ads on a regular\nand frequent schedule so agencies are used instead to create image ads or campaigns.\nSmall-andmedium-sizedretailersoftensavemoneybyusingstockartworkintheiradsand\nother promotional materials.All daily newspapers subscribe to click art services that provide a\nwiderangeofphotographsandlineartdrawings(someforfree,othersforafee).Largerretailers\nor upscale specialty retailers, such as Tiffany’s, generally have their art designed by a staff or\nagencydesignertogivealltheiradsasimilarlookandadistinctimage.Somemanufacturersalso\nprovideade\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
