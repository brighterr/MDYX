We also used some of his Guitar Hero:Smash Hits\nbanners in Chapter 11. Let’s continue that discussion with comments from him on how he devel-\noped the Smash Hitswebsite. He explained that Activision had a very small budget for this cam-\npaign so they decided to focus their spending online. Here’s how the website idea developed\naccording to Contreras:\nAt first they wanted us to create a widget or application on their website to slowly reveal\nthe songs that would be featured in the game. We decided to take it further by creating a\nwebsite from scratch and promoting it with banner ads all over the Web. To add credibility\nand a bit of a fun factor, we named the campaign the 2009 Guitar Hero Smash Hits Music\nAwards.\nTo see how Web marketing communication agencies promote themselves and establish their\nown brand identity, check out the Minnesota-based Risdall Advertising website (www.risdall.net).\n400 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nExplore the various divisions described on this\nwebsite. In particular, look at the page for Ris-\ndall Interactive, a division of the marketing\ncommunication firm that focuses on designing\ninteractive strategies for Risdall clients.\nWhether or not the website is effective\ndependsonseveralfactors—oneisstickiness\nand the other is its ease of navigation.

He and his work were nominated by\nyond the casserole. Within the site, www\nProfessors Glenn Griffin and Patty Alvey.\n.CampbellsKitchen.com, visitors can search\nfor dinner options by mood or flavor, such as\nchocolaty or cheesy, as well as standard menu categories. The site also has a seven-day meal plan-\nning tool, and a section about recipe substitutions and healthy alternatives.\nThe VW “Truth & Dare” website for its Jetta TDI diesel models (http://tdi.vw.com) uses\nvideo clips and interactive tools to debunk myths about diesel, such as diesel is dirty or diesel cars\ndon’t start in the cold. In “diesel decaf,” for example, testers place coffee filters on the exhaust\npipes of various cars and then make coffee using them. Of course, the VWdiesel filter is so clean\nthere is no residue in the coffee. The site also features a blog forum and tools to compare the VW\nTDI brands against competitors, such as a Savings Calculator, which compares fuel efficiency and\ncarbon emissions.15(To see the “coffee filter” test, check http://green.autoblog.com/2009/05/04/\nvw-launches-tdi-truth-and-dare-with-coffee-filter-test.)\nSome people may find a marketer’s website after doing a search using a search engine; oth-\ners may come across the website address in some other communication, such as an ad or brochure.\nBut another way is to encounter a link on a related site usually in the form of an ad with enough\nimpact to entice the visitor to leave the original site and move to this new one. Internet strategists\nare keenly aware of the difficulty of enticing people to websites.\nLike ads, sometimes websites have problems, as Sears found out when a Sears product page\ncarried a product description that proclaimed “Grills to Cook Babies.” The problem was that the\nSears website was open to editing by anyone who wanted to mess with it. Check out the story on\nhttp://consumerist.com/2009/08/sears-caught-selling-grills-to-cook-babies-thanks-to-poorly-built-\nwebsite.html.When Sears tried to get Conde Nast’s Reddit site that wrote about the problem to\ndelete the post, the effort blew up and created a hornet’s nest of negative publicity for Sears.\nE-Mail Communication\nOneoftheattractivefeaturesofusinge-mailforadvertisingisthatitissoinexpensive.Allittakes\nisalistofe-mailaddresses,acomputer,andanInternetconnection.E-mailisaproductofanearlier\ntimeinonlinecommunication—backinthedayswhenweusedtologonandoffandcheckmes-\nsagesinbursts.Someusersstilloperatethatway,butwithnewerformslikeinstantmessaging,Face-\nbook,andTwitter,manyusersarealwaysonlineandthathaschangedthefunction,aswellasthe\nCHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 401\nspeed,ofonlineconnections.Theconstantstreamofinformationmeanstheinboxisnowariver.16\nWe’lltalkmoreaboute-mailmarketinganditseviltwin,spam,inChapter16\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
