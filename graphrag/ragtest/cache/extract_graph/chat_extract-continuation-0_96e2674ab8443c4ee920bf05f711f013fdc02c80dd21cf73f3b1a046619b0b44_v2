We’ve emphasized that effective campaigns do\nmore than win awards for creativity. They work hard to achieve\nthe campaign’s communication and marketing goals, as does\nthe Colorado Pass Club campaign for Vail. As you will see in\nthis chapter, there are many ways to evaluate the effectiveness\nof various aspects of an advertising and marketing communi-\ncation program. Specifically, four categories of work get eval-\nuated in advertising and marketing communication programs:\nthe message execution, the media, the campaign, and the other\nmarketing communication areas and their synergistic effect as\npart of an IMC program. This chapter discusses the basic con-\ncept of the evaluation of effectiveness and then examines those\nfour areas.\nIMPACT: DOES IT WORK?\nWhat makes a marcom message effective? The fact that people\nlike it—or the fact that it moves people to some kind of action?\nThe classic campaign for Avis is an example of one that works\non both levels—people like it and it drove the company to\nrecord sales levels. When advertising works—when marketing\ncommunication is effective—it has impact and generates a re-\nsponse of some kind from its target audience. The critical\nphrase—“as intended”—means there are multiple objectives\nand, therefore, multiple ways to evaluate the effectiveness of\nCLASSIC\nmarketing communication campaigns and programs.\nAccording to Advertising Age, the Avis “We Try Harder”\nLet’s just consider advertising to begin with.

The copy defined\nthan half—produces sales.1 Jones contends that “advertising what it means to try harder (and what a leader in the car\nmust generate an immediate jolt to sales before it can be ex- rental business should be providing)—clean ashtrays, full\npected to produce any further effect.”2 Simon Broadbent, an- gas tanks, wipers that work, washed cars, heaters and\nother leading figure in effectiveness research, disagreed with defrosters that work—and the lines at the counter are\nJones’s short-term sales focus and suggested instead that adver- shorter.

There\nis always a need for the intuitive analysis of ex-\nFIGURE 19.1 perienced professionals. The important thing,\nThe Facets of Effects Model however, is to recognize early in the planning stage the need for a formal evaluation mecha-\nnism, as Professor Mark Stuhlfaut explains. Evaluation should be “planned in” to any cam-\npaign. Evaluation determines the success of a marketing communication, but it also feeds back\ninto the ongoing brand communication plan. Figure 19.2illustrates that process, and Professor\nStuhlfaut’s A Matter of Principle features builds on the idea of a cycle beginning and ending\nPrinciple with research.\nIf you can’t measure it, In addition to intuition and judgment, measurement that tracks consumer response is also\nyou can’t manage it. needed and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COLORADO PASS CLUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Colorado Pass Club campaign is associated with Vail and is used as an example of effective advertising in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAIL<|>GEO<|>Vail is a location associated with the Colorado Pass Club campaign, mentioned in the context of advertising effectiveness)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Avis is a car rental company known for its \"We Try Harder\" campaign, which significantly increased its market share)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOYLE DANE BERNBACH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Doyle Dane Bernbach is the advertising agency that created the successful \"We Try Harder\" campaign for Avis in 1962)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN PHILIP JONES<|>PERSON<|>John Philip Jones is a Syracuse University Professor who has written extensively on advertising effectiveness, emphasizing short-term sales impact)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMON BROADBENT<|>PERSON<|>Simon Broadbent is a leading figure in effectiveness research who advocates for long-term brand building in advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIX FLAGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Six Flags is an amusement park company mentioned in the context of advertising effectiveness and brand awareness)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARK STUHLFAUT<|>PERSON<|>Professor Mark Stuhlfaut is mentioned in the context of emphasizing the importance of planning evaluation into advertising campaigns)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AVIS<|>DOYLE DANE BERNBACH<|>Doyle Dane Bernbach created the \"We Try Harder\" campaign for Avis, which was highly successful<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHN PHILIP JONES<|>SIMON BROADBENT<|>Both John Philip Jones and Simon Broadbent are noted for their differing views on advertising effectiveness<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COLORADO PASS CLUB<|>VAIL<|>The Colorado Pass Club campaign is associated with Vail, highlighting its effectiveness in advertising<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
