CPM is best used when comparing the cost of vehicles within the same medium\n(comparing one magazine with another or one television program with another). This is be-\ncause different media have different levels of impact. To be more precise and determine the ef-\nficiency of a potential media buy, planners often look at the targeted cost per thousand\n(TCPM).\nCHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 439\nTo calculate a CPM for a broadcast commercial, you need only two figures: the cost of an\nad and the estimated audience reached by the vehicle. Multiply the cost of the ad by 1,000 and di-\nvide that number by the size of the broadcast audience. You multiply the cost of the ad by 1,000\nto calculate a “cost per thousand.”\nInthecaseofprint,CPMsarebasedoncirculationornumberofreaders.Timemagazinehas\nacirculationof4millionbutclaimsareadershipof19.5million.Thedifferencebetweencircula-\ntionandreadershipisduetowhatiscalledpass-alongreadership.InthecaseofTime,thismeans\neachissueisreadbyaboutfivepeople.Asyouwouldsuspect,mediavehiclespreferthatagencies\nusereadershipratherthancirculationforfiguringCPMbecausethisproducesamuchlowerCPM.\n• Calculating CPMIn the following example, CPM is calculated based on Timereadership\nand the price of a one-page, four-color ad, $240,000. Remember, you want to know what it\ncosts to reach 1,000 readers.\nCost of ad (cid:5) 1,000\nCPM (cid:4)\nReadership\n$240,000 (cid:5) 1,000\nCPM (cid:4) (cid:4) $12.31 CPM\n19,500,000\n• Calculating TCPMTo figure the TCPM, you first determine how many of Time’s readers\nare in your target audience. For the sake of discussion, we’ll say that only 5 million of\nTime’sreaders fall into our target audience profile. As you can see from the following calcu-\nlation, the TCPM greatly increases. This is because you still have to pay to reach all the\nreaders, even though only about one-fourth of them are of value to you.\nCost of ad (cid:5) 1,000\nTCPM (cid:4)\nReaders in target audience\n$240,000 (cid:5) 1,000\nTCPM (cid:4) (cid:4) $48.00 TCPM\n5,000,000\n• Calculating CPPNow we’ll look at how to determine cost per point (CPP),which esti-\nmates the cost of reaching 1 million households based on a program’s rating points. Divide\nthe cost of running one commercial by the rating of the program in which the commercial\nwill appear. If a 30-second spot on Lostcosts $320,000, and it has a rating of 8, then the cost\nper rating point would be $40,000:\n$320,000\nCPP = = $40,000 CPP\n8 rating\n• Calculating TCPPTo figure the targeted cost per point (TCPP), the rating points based on\nthe target audience you want to reach, determine what percentage of the audience is your tar-\nget. In the case of Lost,we will estimate that half of the audience is our target. Thus, the\noverall rating of 8 is reduced to 4 (50% (cid:5)8(cid:4)4 rating). Now we divide the one-time cost of\n$320,000 by 4 and find the TCPPis $80,000:\n$320,000\nTCPP = = $80,000 TCPP\n4 target rating\nWe can do this calculation to compare several different programs and identify those\nwith lower costs.\nCPMshaveawiderange.AmediaplannermaycalculateaCPMof$56toreachsome44mil-\nlionviewersoftheSuperBowl.8Incontrast,intherealestateexamplegivenearlier,iMapp.com\nmightchargeaCPMof$125toreachasmall,butselectgroupofrealtors.iMappistwiceasexpen-\nsiveastheSuperBowlad(notinrealdollars,butinCPM),butthehigherCPMisjustifiedbecause\nofthetighttargeting.Mediaplannersareconstantlybalancingcostwithaudiencecharacteristicsto\ndecideifthemediavehiclemakessensegiventhetargetaudiencesizeandcharacteristics.\n440 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nA MATTER OF PRINCIPLE\nWhen Is Too Many Too Much?\nTom Duncan,IMC Founder and Director Emeritus, University of Coloradoand Daniels School\nof Business at the University of Denver\nThe questions advertisers have to There is a difference between “buying eyeballs”\nask themselves when approving and delivering messages in a context that will intersect\na plan that involves nontradi- with a target audience’s interests.\ntional media is whether they Wilson Sporting Goods, for example, sponsors\nare using this tool effectively Tennis Camps by furnishing practice balls and making\nand with respect for con- racquets available that participants can try for free.\nsum\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TIME MAGAZINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Time Magazine is a publication with a circulation of 4 million and a readership of 19.5 million, known for its pass-along readership)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPER BOWL<|>EVENT<|>The Super Bowl is a major sporting event with a large viewership, used as a benchmark for media planning with a CPM of $56 to reach 44 million viewers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMAPP.COM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>iMapp.com is a service that charges a CPM of $125 to reach a select group of realtors, offering targeted advertising solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOM DUNCAN<|>PERSON<|>Tom Duncan is the IMC Founder and Director Emeritus at the University of Colorado and Daniels School of Business at the University of Denver)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILSON SPORTING GOODS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wilson Sporting Goods sponsors Tennis Camps by providing practice balls and racquets for participants to try for free)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIME MAGAZINE<|>SUPER BOWL<|>Both Time Magazine and the Super Bowl are used as examples in media planning to illustrate different CPM calculations<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMAPP.COM<|>SUPER BOWL<|>iMapp.com and the Super Bowl are compared in terms of CPM, with iMapp.com being more expensive due to targeted advertising<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOM DUNCAN<|>UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO<|>Tom Duncan is associated with the University of Colorado as the IMC Founder and Director Emeritus<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOM DUNCAN<|>DANIELS SCHOOL OF BUSINESS<|>Tom Duncan is associated with the Daniels School of Business at the University of Denver<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILSON SPORTING GOODS<|>TENNIS CAMPS<|>Wilson Sporting Goods sponsors Tennis Camps by providing equipment for participants<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
