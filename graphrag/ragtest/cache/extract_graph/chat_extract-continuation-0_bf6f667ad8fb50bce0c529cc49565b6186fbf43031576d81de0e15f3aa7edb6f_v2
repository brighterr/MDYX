In most\ncases the objective of sales promotion is to encourage action. Promotions in a more general sense\ncan also help build brand identity and awareness, as the Frontier Airlines case illustrates, but their\nprimary contribution to most marketing communication programs is to drive behavior.\nThe Promotion Marketing Association (PMA) is the professional organization serving this\n$2 trillion industry. Founded in 1911, the organization promotes excellence in promotion mar-\nketing and showcases such practices in its Reggie Awards program. Although the breadth of the\nindustry has exploded with the new opportunities provided by the Internet, a simple definition\nidentifies the key elements of promotion marketing as follows: “The media and non-media mar-\nketing pressure applied for a predetermined, limited period of time at the level of consumer, re-\ntailer, or wholesaler in order to stimulate trial, increase consumer demand, or improve product\navailability.”1\nLet’sexaminethisdefinition.First,itacknowledgesthatconsumersareanimportanttargetfor\npromotions,butsoareotherstakeholders,suchasthecompany’ssalesrepresentativesandmem-\nbersofthetrade(wholesalers,retailers).Second,thedefinitionrecognizesthatsalespromotionis\nasetoftechniquesthatpromptsmembersofthreetargetaudiences—consumers,salesrepresenta-\ntives,andthetrade(distributors,retailers,dealers)—totakeaction,preferablyimmediateaction.\nSimply put, sales promotion affects demand by offering an incentive to act, usually in the\nform of a price reduction, but it also may offer additional amounts of the product, cash, prizes and\nPrinciple\ngifts, premiums, special events, and so on. An example of a promotional incentive was a $1 mil-\nSales promotion is\nlion offer by Netflix to consumers who could offer ideas for improving its movie recommenda-\nprimarily designed to\naffect demand by tion software.

Until the 1980s, advertising was the dominant\nplayer in the marketing communication arena. But during the 1980s more marketers found them-\nselves driving immediate bottom-line responses through the use of sales promotion.\nAccountability In terms of the need for accountability for marketing communication efforts,\nmost U.S. companies focus on immediate profits, a drive that sales promotion satisfies. Because\nthe benefits of advertising are often more apparent in the long term, companies invest more\nmoney in sales promotion when they want quick results. Product managers are under pressure to\ngenerate quarterly, or even monthly or weekly, sales increases. Arlene Gerwin, a marketing con-\nsultant who consults on promotional planning, explains, “Sales promotions deliver more imme-\ndiate consumer response and a quicker payback than advertising.”2 Hence the pressure for\nshort-term profits leads to bigger sales promotion budgets.\nAnother aspect of accountability is result driven. Sales promotions are relatively easy to\nevaluate in terms of their impact on sales and whether a sales promotion strategy has accom-\nplished its objectives. Because promotions operate in a finite time frame and deliver action, in\nGerwin’s view, it is relatively easy and quick to evaluate their success because there is usually an\nimmediate response of some kind.\nIt also is easier to compute a return on investment (ROI) for promotions than for advertising.\nThis process is known as payout planningand means that the results derived from a promotion\ncan be estimated and compared with the projected costs of the effort. If the promotion doesn’t de-\nliver more than it costs, then it is not a good idea, at least financially. Admittedly there may be other\nreasons for conducting a promotion, but usually the go/no-go decision is based on the effort’s ROI.\nFor example, Moonfruit, a company that helps small businesses build do-it-yourself web-\nsites, gave away 10 MacBook Pros as part of a birthday celebration. To be eligible, participants\nhad to send a creative Tweet, an idea that exploded on Twitter, brought lots of people to the com-\npany’s website, and generated tons of publicity. If handled through a traditional advertising cam-\npaign, the exposure would have cost far more than the price of 10 MacBook Pros.3(Check out\nMoonfruit at www.moonfruit.com.)\nMedia Shifts Advertisers also cite other economic reasons for the shift. Traditional media costs\nhave escalated to the point where alternative types of media must be considered. As the networks\nhave raised their advertising prices, their share of prime-time television viewers has dropped dra-\nmatically. The proliferation of media and competition for audiences’attention also factor in the\nneed for accountability. Advertisers, therefore, are exploring marketing communication forms\nthat cost less and produce immediate, tangible results. Sales promotion can deliver these results.\nGlobal incentive programs are also experiencing explosive growth and much of that relates\neither to IMC or changes in global media. The international product manager for one promotional\ncompany indicates that the number of clients seeking global incentive programs has increased\ndramatically. Some of the reasons for this growth include the interest of multinational corpora-\ntions in aligning all units with corporate goals, increasing bottom-line efficiency, and taking ad-\nvantage of the rise of the Internet.4\nMarketplace Changes Other reasons for the move to sales promotion match changes in the mar-\nketplace\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FRONTIER AIRLINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Frontier Airlines is an airline company known for its promotional activities, such as the favorite animal contest, which helps build brand identity and awareness)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROMOTION MARKETING ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Promotion Marketing Association (PMA) is a professional organization serving the promotion marketing industry, promoting excellence and showcasing practices through its Reggie Awards program)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETFLIX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Netflix is a streaming service that offered a $1 million incentive to consumers for ideas to improve its movie recommendation software)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARLENE GERWIN<|>PERSON<|>Arlene Gerwin is a marketing consultant who specializes in promotional planning and emphasizes the immediate consumer response and quicker payback of sales promotions compared to advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOONFRUIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Moonfruit is a company that helps small businesses build do-it-yourself websites and gained publicity by giving away 10 MacBook Pros as part of a promotional campaign)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRONTIER AIRLINES<|>PROMOTION MARKETING ASSOCIATION<|>Frontier Airlines' promotional activities, like the favorite animal contest, align with the Promotion Marketing Association's goal of promoting excellence in promotion marketing<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NETFLIX<|>PROMOTION MARKETING ASSOCIATION<|>Netflix's $1 million offer for improving its recommendation software is an example of a promotional incentive that aligns with the Promotion Marketing Association's definition of promotion marketing<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARLENE GERWIN<|>PROMOTION MARKETING ASSOCIATION<|>Arlene Gerwin's views on sales promotions delivering immediate consumer response align with the Promotion Marketing Association's focus on promotion marketing<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOONFRUIT<|>PROMOTION MARKETING ASSOCIATION<|>Moonfruit's promotional campaign of giving away MacBook Pros exemplifies the kind of innovative promotion marketing that the Promotion Marketing Association showcases<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
