IMC is the goal of most marketers, but multichannel is what they actually do.”10\nAn example of IMC multimedia planning comes from The Today Show, which launched a\nnew recipe website and mobile application in sponsorship with Unilever. The “Cooking School”\nwebsite contains previously aired segments of “Today’s Kitchen” and streaming video webisodes,\nas well as recipes, cooking tips, and promotions for Unilever brands such as Bertolli, Country\nCrock, Hellmann’s, and Ragu. The recipes can be downloaded at home or to a mobile device. A\nSmartphone app allows users to compile recipes and build shopping lists. The “Cooking School”\npartnership links mobile, online, and broadcast media.11\nAnother distinctive feature of IMC media plans is its emphasis on contact points. Media\nplanning in an IMC campaign focuses on every important contact point. These can include a va-\nriety of experiential media, as well as conventional media. Think about all the ways you come in\ncontact with a brand message when you fly on an airline—reservations, check in, baggage check-\ning, the gate, the cabin attendants and officer’s messages over the loudspeaker, the seats and food\nand other cabin features, departure and arrival times, deplaning, baggage again, not to mention\ncustomer service when you miss a plane or a bag gets lost. That’s just a brief list and you can prob-\nably add to it. Alist of contact points an IMC planner might consider would be endless, but a sam-\nple list is available online on this book’s website (www.pearsonhighered.com/moriarty).\nDentsu’s ContactPoint Management Tokyo-based Dentsu, which is the world’s largest individual\nagency, has a strong IMC orientation, which shows up in the way Dentsu planners create IMC me-\ndia plans. Dentsu’s ContactPoint Management offering is a section in its IMC 2.0 model that identi-\nfies a wide diversity of contact points, including but not limited to such separate communication\nfunctions as public relations, sponsorship, direct-response marketing, events, word of mouth\n(WOM), in-store (signage, POP, personnel), sales promotion, traditional advertising media (broadcast,\nprint, out-of-home), sports, entertainment, interactive (Web, podcasting), mobile media, and new out-\nof-home (OOH) media. Let’s take a closer look at Dentsu’s approach to IMC media planning.12\nThe objective of Dentsu’s ContactPoint Management planning is to select the most effective\ncontact points required to achieve the desired communication goals and to implement optimum\nintegrated communication programs that eliminate waste. ContactPoint Management focuses on\ntwo strategies that are critical in delivering effective integrated communication:\n1. Identify the value contact points, that is, the emotion-driving points at which or during\nwhich consumers come in contact with a brand.\n2. Move away from the traditional B2C model, in which business targets a consumer with a\nmessage, to a more interactive B2C2C model, in which a business talks to consumers who\ntalk to other consumers. This approach uses mass media to stimulate interconsumer com-\nmunications, or word of mouth, which delivers messages more persuasively.\nCHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 445\nMedia selection recognizes that (1) contact points that work well must differ depending on\nthe communication goal and (2) contact point effectiveness will differ from product category to\nproduct category and from target to target.\nAn example of how Dentsu manages a full set of brand contact points comes from an auto-\nmotive campaign where two target audiences have been identified as Fathers (male, 50s) and\nDaughters (female, 20s). The communication objective is to position the new subcompact car\nmodel as “fun driving for grown men” and “a small cute model for young women.”\nThe various contact points considered are evaluated and ranked using a proprietary contact\npoint planning system called VALCON (Value ContactPoint Tracer). Dentsu planners also have\naccess to hundreds of media-related databases with vast volumes of contact point information to\nconsult in this process. The final decisions about media usage are based on the roles and effects\nof the various media.\nFor the new subcompact, contact points were evaluated based on three objectives: their ability\nto launch a new product (recognition, build awareness), arouse interest (evaluation), and make the\ntarget feel like buying (intention, attitude).
