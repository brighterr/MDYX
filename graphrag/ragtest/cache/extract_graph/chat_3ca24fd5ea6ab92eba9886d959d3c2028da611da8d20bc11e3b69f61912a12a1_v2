In Part 4, we’re turning to the delivery of the mes-\nsage and we’ll look at media planning.\nPlease note that creative and media planning are parallel and simultaneous processes that are\ncompletely interdependent. Even though we started first with creative, remember that because of\nthe dynamic media environment, more and more the creative challenge has become to pick the\nperfect place to deliver—or encounter—a brand message. In fact, media planning is just as cre-\native as message planning.\nAcrucial point is that the media side of advertising is probably the area that has been chal-\nlenged the most in terms of changes in the media landscape, as well as media planning practices.\nTo underscore the importance of this dynamic media environment, Larry Kelley, partner and me-\ndia director at FogartyKleinMonroe, professor at the University of Houston, and author of many\narticles and books on media, identifies the four most important trends in the practice of media\nplanning.\nOut of Disruption\nComes Opportunity\nDisruption is the key word to describe the media business today. Everywhere you turn, new tech-\nnologies, new consumer attitudes, and new methodologies are challenging the conventional wis-\ndom of media companies and media planners.\nAs we move forward into this brave new media world, there will be some funda-\nmental changes. The first is that media content companies (online and offline publish-\ners and broadcasters) may not be able to rely on advertising to carry their financial\nload. Historically, media companies largely gave away content for distribution but\nwill that model hold up going forward?\nLarry Kelley\nLarry Kelley is Professor of\nAdvertising at the University of\nHouston and partner, Chief Planning\nOfficer at the Houston-based FKM\nagency.\n322\nChapter 11 • Media Basics\nChapter 12 • Traditional Media\nChapter 13 • Digital Media\nChapter 14 • Media Planning and Buying\nThe second is the consumer attitudes toward media of a new generation who grew up with\nthe Internet. The idea of looking at media as a consumer engagement rather than a pure interrup-\ntion will challenge media planners and advertisers alike.\nThe third is digital convergence. All media will likely have some form of digital and inter-\nactive component, making media selection even more challenging as the lines between various\nmedia blur.\nThe final change is in the methodology of measurement. Impressions will not be the cur-\nrency or the method of choice for media selection. In the future we will move from OTS or “op-\nportunity to see” to OFB or “opportunity for behavior” as the critical metric.\nFor those who are considering media as a career, there is no better time to enter a business\nthan when it is in a disruptive state. Out of disruption comes opportunity.\nThe media world has been in a state of incredible change from old traditional mass media to\nnew interactive social media; from marketers’control of media placement to consumers’control\nof media use; and from media targeting to media engagement. In this section, Chapter 14 presents\nan introduction to the basics of media strategy and the changes in the media industry. Subsequent\nchapters focus on print and broadcast advertising and the Internet. The final chapter in this part\ndiscusses media planning and buying, which is the process by which message strategies are trans-\nlated into decisions about the appropriate media to use to best reach specific target audiences.\n323\n11\nMedia Basics\nIt’s a Winner\nCampaign: Company: Agencies: Award:\n“Axe Detailer: The Unilever Bartle Bogle Hegarty with Gold Effie Winner,\nManly Shower Mindshare and Edelman New Product or\nTool” Integrated Marketing Services Service Category\nR\nE\nT\nP\nA\nH\nC\n324\nCHAPTER KEY POINTS\n1.
