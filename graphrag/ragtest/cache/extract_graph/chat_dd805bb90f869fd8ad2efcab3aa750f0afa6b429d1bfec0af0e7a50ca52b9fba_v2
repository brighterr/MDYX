He also believed in using cultural\narchetypes to create mythical characters who represented American values, such as the Jolly\nGreen Giant, Tony the Tiger, the Pillsbury Doughboy, and his most famous campaign character,\nthe Marlboro Man (www.leoburnett.com).\nOgilvy, founder of the Ogilvy & Mather agency, is in some ways a paradox because he mar-\nried both the image schoolof Rubicam and the claim schoolof Lasker and Hopkins. He created\nenduring brands with symbols,such as the Hathaway Man and his mysterious eye patch for the\nHathaway shirt maker, and handled such quality products as Rolls-Royce, Pepperidge Farm, and\nGuinness with product-specific and information-rich claims (www.ogilvy.com).\nThe Doyle, Dane, and Bernbach (DDB) agency opened in 1949. From the beginning,\nWilliam Bernbach—with his acute sense of words, design, and creative concepts—was consid-\nered to be the most innovative advertising creative person of his time. His advertising touched\npeople—and persuaded them—by focusing on feelings and emotions.He explained, “There are\na lot of great technicians in advertising. However, they forget that advertising is persuasion, and\npersuasion is not a science, but an art. Advertising is the art of persuasion.”4Bernbach is known\nfor the understated Volkswagen campaign that ran at a time when car ads were full of glamour\nand bombast. The campaign used headlines such as “Think Small” with accompanying picture of\na small VWbug (www.ddb.com).\nThe Era of Accountability and Integration Starting in the 1970s, the industry-wide focus was\noneffectiveness. Clients wanted ads that produced sales, so the emphasis was on research, test-\ning, and measurement. To be accountable, advertising and other marketing communication agencies\nrecognized that their work had to prove its value. After the dot.com boom and economic down-\nturn in the 1980s and 1990s, this emphasis on accountability became even more important, and\nadvertisers demanded proof that their advertising was truly effective in accomplishing its\nobjectivesas stated in the strategy.\nSocial responsibilityis another aspect of accountability. Although advertising regulation has\nbeen in place since the early 1900s with the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906 and\nCHAPTER 1 • THE NEW WORLD OF MARKETING COMMUNICATION 17\nSHOWCASE\nThe pro bono Handgun Control campaign was designed as a wake-up call following the Columbine High School shootings.\nChris Hutchinson, art director at Weiden (cid:2)Kennedy, explained that “Children killing children with guns is a very real\nissue and we wanted to communicate the horror of this. The visuals are meant to shock juxtaposing toys\nwith gun violence.”\nChris Hutchinson graduated from the advertising program at the University of Oregon. He was\nnominated to have his work showcased in this text by Professor Charles Frazer.\nthe creation of the Federal Trade Commissionin 1914, it wasn’t until 1971 that the National Ad-\nvertising Review Board was created to monitor questions of taste and social responsibility.\nCharges of using sweatshops in low-wage countries and an apparent disregard for the environ-\nment concerned critics such as Naomi Klein, who wrote the best-selling book No Logoand Marc\nGobe who wrote Citizen Brands.One highly visible campaign that demonstrates this commit-\nment is the “Truth” campaign developed by Crispin Porter (cid:2) Bogusky along with Arnold\nWorldwide to provide informative documentary-style print ads and television commercials that\ninform youth about the dangers of smoking without preaching to them.\nAs the digital era brought nearly instantaneous means of communication, spreading word of\nmouthamong a social network of consumers, companies became even more concerned about their\npractices and reputation.The recession that began in December 2007 and subsequent headlines about\nbad business practices, such as the Bernard Madoff “Ponzi” scheme, made consumers even more con-\ncerned about business ethics.\nWe also characterize this as the era when integrated marketing communication became\nimportant. Integrated marketing communication (IMC) is another technique that\nmanagersbegantoadoptinthe1980sasawaytobettercoordinatetheirbrandcom-\nmunication.Integrationandconsistencymakesmarketingcommunicationmoreeffi-\ncientandthusmorefinanciallyaccountable. Strategy Media\nSo What Are the Key Components of Advertising?\nIn this brief review of how advertising developed over some 300 years, a number of Effectiveness\nkey concepts were introduced all of which will be discussed in more detail in the chap-\nters that follow. But let’s summarize these concepts in terms of a simple set of key\ncomponents that describe the practice of advertising: strategy, message, media, and Message Evaluation\nevaluation (see Figure 1.2):\n• StrategyThe logic behind an advertisement is stated in objectives that focus on FIGURE 1.2\nareas such as sales, news, psychological appeals, emotion, branding and brand Four Components of Advertising\n18 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
