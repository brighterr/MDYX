For fast-food franchises, radio buys at the local level supplement na-\ntional television. Radio acts as a reminder, with spots concentrated during morning drive time,\nnoon, and evening drive time. The messages focus on the location of local restaurants and spe-\ncial promotions. Radio is also flexible and allows for easy changes to schedules. For example,\na local hardware store can quickly implement a snow-shovel promotion the morning after a\nsnowstorm.\nAdisadvantage of radio is that it plays in the background for many of our activities. Although\nthe radio is on, the multitasking listener may not really be listening to or concentrating on the mes-\nsage. Listeners tend to tune in and tune out as something catches their attention, which is why ef-\nfective radio advertising is designed to “break through” the surrounding clutter. Generally radio\nad clutter is lower than television clutter, which averages 15 to 20 minutes per hour of commer-\ncials versus 10 to 15 minutes on radio. Also, the lack of visuals on radio can be a problem for\nproducts that need to be demonstrated.\nTelevision Basics\nTelevision has become a mainstay of society with, on average, some 280 million sets in use in the\nUnited States. Television approaches the universality of radio with 98 percent of American house-\nholds having one or more television sets. In over half of U.S. households, the TVis on “most” of\nthe time. The U.S. television audience, however, is highly fragmented, tuning in to 100 or more\ndifferent channels. Nielsen Media Research estimates that the average U.S. household has the set\non more than five hours a day.21\nTelevision is primarily an entertainment medium although a recent trend, called “behavior\nplacement,” is experimenting with moving TVprograms into social behavior modification. For\nexample, a segment of The Officeturned one of the actors into a superhero obsessed with recy-\ncling. Scripting positive behaviors into TVshows is seen as a way to model positive behaviors\nand influence viewers.22\nTelevision’s use also expanded with the introduction of the Wii, which makes the home\nTVscreen a facilitator in exercise programs, as well as games. As computers begin to use TV\nscreens to project their content, this cross-channel merger will open up entirely new uses for\nhome TVs.\nThe heavy use of television by children is of concern to parents and early childhood experts.\nRecent studies found that U.S. children spend an average of nearly four hours a day watching tel-\nevision, DVDs, and videos. Furthermore, three-fourths of sixth graders have a TVin their bed-\nroom. Advertisers are happy to hear that kids haven’t totally abandoned TV programming for\ngames and the Web, but these numbers are still worrisome for critics of children’s programming\nand advertising.\nTelevisionadvertisingisembeddedinprogramming,somostoftheattentioninmediabuy-\ning,aswellasinthemeasurementoftelevisionadvertising’seffectiveness,isfocusedontheper-\nformance of various shows and how they engage their audiences.
