They understand that this type of\nMarketers who use social\nmedia recognize the value marketing is less about being self-serving and more about serving and service. Social media are\nin conversations and also about speed of response—its interaction is much more dynamic than previous media and\ncustomer relationship- when questions are asked or complaints are posted, speedy response is essential. Marketers in\nbuilding communication. businesses where last-minute marketing and consumer decision making are important, such as ski\nresorts, can benefit by providing real-time videos and photos, along with Tweets to skiers.\nUnderstanding the notion of communities is critical. Some form spontaneously around a\ntopic; others already exist. Marketers can help form some communities and help people get to-\ngether; in other communities they need to maintain a low profile. Abasic principle is to know the\ncommunity rules and respect that everyone is different. An interesting promotion by Fox media\nused a newspaper ad to reach people who might be interested in joining FoxNation. It’s a digital\ncommunity centered on the FoxNation.comwebsite, which includes, videos, blogs, and news sto-\nries. The ad enlisted Uncle Sam, or at least his famous image and the “I Want You” pointing fin-\nger (see Chapter 4), to help promote the FoxNation.com.\nThe problem with social marketing is that it is changing so fast. MySpace gave way in pop-\nularity to Facebook about the same time Twitter appeared on the scene, and they all essentially\nmade chat rooms outdated. The social media we’ve discussed here are just a few sites in a huge\nenvironment. Marketers who want an online presence need to keep up with new technologies and\nnew sites—and know how best to use them.\nHOW IS INTERNET MARCOM EVOLVING?\nThe Internet itself is a catalyst for new thinking about how marcom can be used. New strategies\nand practices have developed to extend this new world of Web-based marketing communication.\nCHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 411\nOffline Advertising for Websites\nOne of the most difficult problems facing Internet marketers is driving traffic to their sites. One way\nto do this is to use offline advertising,which appears in conventional media to drive traffic to a web-\nsite. In the Chapter 12opening story, we explained how Aflac used a teaser ad in print media with\nthe headline “youdontknowquack.com” to entice readers to check out its site. Once there, readers\nhad a little test on common myths including one that asks about coverage of medical expenses. The\nanswer, of course, argued that everyone needs Aflac to cover all of those other expenses.\nPrintisparticularlyusefulinofflineadvertisingbecauseitofferstheopportunitytopresent\ntheURLinaformatthatmakesitpossibleforthereadertonotetheaddress.It’shardertopresent\nthatinformationinbroadcastmediawherethemessageishereandgone.Whateverthemedium,\nincluding URLs in traditional ads does matter to consumers, as the Practical Tips box at\nwww.pearsonhighered.com/moriartyexplains.\nE-Media Developments and Applications\nAs we have said before, convergence is a big challenge, as well as an opportunity, for traditional\nmedia industries where the differences between television, print, and the Internet media are blur-\nring. Just to remind you, here are some examples of these changes:\n• An online version of the New York Times Sunday Stylemagazine appears as a new website\nwith daily articles and Web-only features.\n• Esquiremagazine is experimenting with technology embedded in its print pages that can\ntrigger real-life video images when the page is held up to a Web camera.\n• Podcasts,audio shows from the Web that can be downloaded to an MP3 player, are chang-\ning the way we listen to radio, as well as music. Walt Disney was one of the first companies\nto explore the potential of podcasts for promotions when it used a series of them for Disney-\nland’s 50th anniversary celebration.\n• TVs and computers are hooking up so you can access the Internet from your TVin your liv-\ning room or watch your video downloads from your cell phone on your big screen TV, a\ntrend referred to as “tradigital.”50\n• Web TVis stealing market share from network and cable TVand Hulu.com,the Internet’s\nmost popular streaming video site, is a prize that Comcast acquired when it bought NBC in\n2009. Part of that deal was to limit or control the shows available online in order protect ca-\nble subscriptions.51\n• Xbox game players can access Twitter and Facebook from the game’s console making it\npossible for players to tweet their progress, share notes, and compete in real time.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>XEROX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Xerox is a company that launched a promotion about a fake psychological disorder called Information Overload Syndrome, which resulted in a substantial increase in brand-related searches<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOX MEDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fox Media is a company that used a newspaper ad to promote FoxNation, a digital community centered on the FoxNation.com website<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFLAC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Aflac is a company that used a teaser ad in print media to drive traffic to its website, youdontknowquack.com, where readers could take a test on common myths<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK TIMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The New York Times is a media organization that has an online version of its Sunday Style magazine with daily articles and Web-only features<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESQUIRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Esquire is a magazine experimenting with technology embedded in its print pages to trigger real-life video images when held up to a Web camera<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALT DISNEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Walt Disney is a company that explored the potential of podcasts for promotions during Disneyland’s 50th anniversary celebration<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMCAST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Comcast is a telecommunications company that acquired Hulu.com, the Internet’s most popular streaming video site, when it bought NBC in 2009<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NBC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NBC is a major television network that was acquired by Comcast in 2009, which included Hulu.com as part of the deal<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HULU.COM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hulu.com is the Internet’s most popular streaming video site, which was acquired by Comcast when it bought NBC in 2009<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TWITTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Twitter is a social media platform that can be accessed from Xbox game consoles, allowing players to tweet their progress and share notes<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACEBOOK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Facebook is a social media platform that can be accessed from Xbox game consoles, allowing players to share notes and compete in real time<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYSPACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MySpace is a social media platform that lost popularity to Facebook around the time Twitter appeared<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XEROX<|>INFORMATION OVERLOAD SYNDROME<|>Xerox launched a promotion about a fake psychological disorder called Information Overload Syndrome<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOX MEDIA<|>FOX NATION<|>Fox Media used a newspaper ad to promote FoxNation, a digital community<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AFLAC<|>YOUDONTKNOWQUACK.COM<|>Aflac used a teaser ad to drive traffic to its website, youdontknowquack.com<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMCAST<|>NBC<|>Comcast acquired NBC in 2009, which included Hulu.com as part of the deal<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMCAST<|>HULU.COM<|>Comcast acquired Hulu.com when it bought NBC in 2009<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWITTER<|>XBOX<|>Twitter can be accessed from Xbox game consoles, allowing players to tweet their progress<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACEBOOK<|>XBOX<|>Facebook can be accessed from Xbox game consoles, allowing players to share notes and compete in real time<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYSPACE<|>FACEBOOK<|>MySpace lost popularity to Facebook around the time Twitter appeared<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
