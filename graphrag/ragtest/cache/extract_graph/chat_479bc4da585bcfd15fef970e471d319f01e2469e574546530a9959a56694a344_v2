The people Entertainment is as much\nformerly known as “audiences” are creating their own content, a practice we have referred to of a driving force for\nas consumer-generated content, such as the homemade videos and commercials seen on modern digital media as\nYouTube and personalized audio listening courtesy of the iPod and other MP3 players. Enter- news was for traditional\nmedia.\ntainment has become as much of a driving force for modern digital media as news was for tra-\nditional media.\nTwo major changes in media use patterns are media-driven lives and media multitasking. In\ntheir youthful days the traditionalists’and baby boomers’lives were dominated by work and fam-\nily activities. In contrast, more recent generations spend more time with media of all kinds, and\nthose channels are more intertwined with their family, work, and leisure time. People not only\nspend more time with media, they use more than one medium at a time.20\nTraditionally most media involved a solitary experience—reading a paper or listening to ra-\ndio, for example, but another transformation is the creation of truly social media. First there were\nblogs, then MySpace and Facebook, then Twitter—all of which made personal space public. The im-\nmediacy and intimacy of a phone conversation has exploded into millions of interactions via Twitter.\n(Think about this: if you can send 1 million tweets, are you broadcasting? You probably don’t know\nthe 1 million recipients—so has Twitter become a form of mass media?)\nIt used to be that global media were limited in number and generally media were limited by\nnational boundaries—most media, particularly newspapers, radio, and television, were primarily\nlocal. The Internet changed all that. You can be on an island in Indonesia and still text about your\nexperiences to friends back home. Most travelers from Western countries are connected to their me-\ndia wherever they are in the world. Some coun-\ntries, such as China, try to control the Internet\naccess of their citizens, but most people are able\nto travel the world of the Web logging into sites\nwithout consideration of where they are or where\nthe site comes from.\nNew and Alternative Forms\nof Contact\nThis is the most creative time in the history of\ncommercial media.
