In a personal interview the researcher asks questions to the consumer\ndirectly. The primary difference between an interview and a survey is the interviewer’s use of a\nmore flexible and unstructured questionnaire. This is the type of research method used by the\nLexus “super-affluent team” we discussed earlier. Interviewers use a discussion guide, which out-\nlines the areas to be covered during the session.\nThe discussion guides tend to be longer than surveys with questions that are usually very\nbroad. Examples include “What do you like or dislike about this product?” and “What type of tel-\nevision programs do you like to watch?” Interviewers probe by responding to the answer with\n“Why do you say that?” or “Can you explain in more detail?” Interviews are considered qualita-\ntive because they typically use smaller sample sizes than surveys, their results cannot be gener-\nalized, and they are subjected to statistical tests.\nCHAPTER 6 • STRATEGIC RESEARCH 177\nA MATTER OF PRACTICE: PART 1\nOnline Survey Research\nKarl Weiss,President/CEO, Market Perceptions Inc., Denver, CO\nWithout a doubt, the Internet has for- e-mail addresses like there is of physical addresses.
