One way to intensify\ninterest is through curiosity, such as using a teaser campaign where the message unfolds\nover time. Ads that open with questions or dubious or ambiguous statements are designed to\ncreate curiosity.\n• Messages That ResonateAds that amplify the emotional impact of a message by engaging a\nconsumer in a personal connection with a brand are said to resonate with the target audience.\nThe women’s campaign for Nike, for example, does a good job of speaking to women in a\nway that addresses their concerns about personal achievement, rather than the competitive\ntheme of the more traditional men’s campaign. If a woman identifies with this message, then\nit is said to resonate for her.\n• Messages That Create BelievabilityAdvertising sometimes uses a credibility strategy to in-\ntensify the believability of a message. Using data to support or prove a claim is critical. The\nuse of brand characters such as Colonel Sanders for KFC, who was a real person and the\ncreator of the famous chicken recipe (“11 herbs and spices”), is designed to give consumers\nareason to believein a brand by cementing conviction.\n• Messages That Are RememberedNot only do messages have to stop(get attention) and pull Principle\n(create interest), they also have to stick(in memory), which is another important part of the A message needs to stop\nperceptual process. Most advertisements, for example, are carefully designed to ensure that (get attention), pull(create\nthese memory traces are easy to recall.

Ads memorable).\nuse catchy headlines, curiosity, and intriguing visuals to make this recall process as easy as\npossible and lock the message in memory.\nRepetition is used both in media and message strategy to ensure memorability. Jingles are\nvaluable memorability devices because the music allows the advertiser to repeat a phrase or prod-\nuct name without boring the audience. Advertising psychologist Esther Thorson says asking the\nconsumer to make a moral or value judgment also anchors the copy point in memory, such as re-\nlating the point to a good cause.14\nCleverphrasesareusefulnotonlybecausetheygrabtheconsumer’sattention,butalsobe-\ncause they can be repeated to intensify memorability.

The news angle, which is often delivered by publicity stories, is infor-\nmation focused. Sometimes this means following a press release with a long-copy print ad or\nan infomercial in television. Informative ads and brochures that focus on features and attrib-\nutes seek to create understanding about a product’s advantages. Comparison ads are often\nheavy on information and used to explain a product’s point of difference and competitive ad-\nvantage. Attributes can be both tangible and intangible (see Figure 8.5). The ads for Sunkist\noranges and Harley-Davidson focus on tangible and intangible features.\n• Messages That TeachPeople learn through instruction so some advertisements are designed\nto teach, such as demonstrations that show how something works or how to solve a problem.\nEducational messages are sometimes designed to explain something, such as why it is im-\nportant to brush your teeth or get involved in local politics.
