This ad was contributed by the Boston University • Theslice-of-lifemessageis an elaborate version\nAdLab. of a problem solution staged in the form of a\ndrama in which “typical people” talk about a com-\nmon problem and resolve it.\n• In the spokesperson(alsospokes-character,brand icon) or endorserformat, the ad fea-\ntures celebrities we like (Michael Jordan), created characters (the Aflac duck, the Geico\nCaveman), experts we respect (the Maytag repairman, doctors), or someone “just like us”\nwhose advice we might seek. The spokesperson speaks on behalf of the product to build\ncredibility. Arecent change in FTC rules now makes endorsers, as well as advertisers, liable\nfor false or unsubstantiated claims, so spokespersons have to be very careful about what they\nsay about any product they advertise.\n• Teasersare mystery ads that don’t identify the product or don’t deliver enough information\nto make sense, but they are designed to arouse curiosity. These are often used to launch a\nnew product. The ads run for a while without the product identification and then when cu-\nriosity is sufficiently aroused, usually at the point when the product is officially launched, a\nconcluding ad runs with the product identification.\nThe use of celebrities as spokespersons, endorsers, or brand symbols is an important strategy\nbecause it associates the brand with a famous person and qualities that make that person important.\nMichael Jackson is credited with starting a new era of celebrity advertising when he signed a record-\nbreaking $5 million contract with Pepsi in 1984. Before that time, celebrities were often reluctant\nto appear for a brand because they feared it might tarnish their image. More recently advertisers have\nworried about celebrities they have signed who might tarnish the brand’s image. Aclassic example\nis Michael Phelps, the winner of eight gold medals in the Beijing Olympics, who appeared in the\nfamous “Breakfast of Champions” series on Corn Flakes packages. After the swimmer was sus-\npended for three months by USASwimming for a photo that showed him inhaling from a marijuana\npipe, Kellogg’s dropped him from the package. In another example, many companies distanced\nthemselves from Tiger Woods following disclosure of his personal problems. One source estimates\nthat Woods lost between $23 million and $30 million in endorsements with companies such as Ac-\ncenture and AT&T.13Temperamental stars, drug and driving arrests, assaults, and loose tongues are\na nightmare for marketers.\nAnotheraspectofcelebrityeffectivenessistheirappealorinfluence.Thereareanumber\nof ways to measure this.An E Score is a system of ratings for celebrities, athletes, and other\nnewsmakersthatmeasurestheirappeal.AQScoreisameasureofthefamiliarityofacelebrity,\naswellasacompanyorbrand.TheDavieBrownIndex(DBI)measuresacelebrity’sawareness,\nappeal,andrelevanceasabrandimage.Italsoevaluatestheinfluenceofthecelebrityonbuy-\ningbehavior.\nCHAPTER 8 • THE CREATIVE SIDE 241\nMatching Messages to Objectives\nWetalkedearlieraboutmessageplanning,includingobjectives,andthenmovedtoadiscussion\nofvarioustypesofmessagestrategies.Now,let’strytobringthosetwotogether.Whattypesof\nmessages deliver which objectives?

Getting consumers’attention\nrequires stopping power. Creative advertising breaks through the old patterns of seeing and\nsaying things—the unexpectedness of the new idea (the Geico Caveman) creates stopping\npower. Ads that stop the scanning and break through the clutter can also be high in personal\nrelevance. Intrusiveness is particularly important in cluttered markets. Many clutter-busting\nads are intrusive and use loud, bold effects to attract viewer attention—they work by shout-\ning. Others use engaging, captivating ideas, curiosity/ambiguity, or mesmerizing visuals.\nCuriosity is particularly important for teaser strategies.\n• Messages That Create InterestGetting attention reflects the stopping power of an advertise-\nment; keeping attention reflects the ad’s pulling power. An interesting thought keeps readers’\nor viewers’attention and pulls them through to the end of the message. One way to intensify\ninterest is through curiosity, such as using a teaser campaign where the message unfolds\nover time. Ads that open with questions or dubious or ambiguous statements are designed to\ncreate curiosity.\n• Messages That ResonateAds that amplify the emotional impact of a message by engaging a\nconsumer in a personal connection with a brand are said to resonate with the target audience.\nThe women’s campaign for Nike, for example,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
