This is simply the number of homes in a geographic area that can pick up the station clearly,\nwhether those homes are actually tuned in or not. Abetter measure is station or program ratings,\nwhich measures the percent of homes actually tuned in to the particular station. Factors such as com-\npeting programs, types of programs, and time of day or night influence the circulation figure.\nThe Arbitron Ratings Company estimates the size of radio audiences for more than 250 mar-\nkets in the United States.Arbitron has been using a seven-day, self-administered diary. Anew tech-\nnology Arbitron is rolling out called the Portable People Meter (PPM) is a pager-size device that\ndetects codes embedded in the audio programming regardless of where the device—whether tra-\nditional radio, computer, or cell phone—is located. The device has been found to be quite effective\nat predicting audience interest, even leading to some major format changes such as when WRFF\nin Philadelphia switched from a Spanish-language talk show format to alternative rock after new\nPPM data revealed that rock music was more popular with the WRFF audience.\nRadio Advertising The first radio commercials hit the air in 1922 in New York and advertised\na real estate firm. These early ads were highly successful for many of the same reasons that keep\nradio popular today with advertisers. The radio listening experience is unlike that of any other\nmedia, creating both challenges and opportunities for radio advertisers. It can be a more intimate\nexperience, because we tend to listen to it alone, particularly for people wearing headphones. In\ncars, where many people listen to radio, it offers advertisers something close to a captive audi-\nence. And it’s relatively inexpensive both to produce commercials and buy airtime. Check out\nthe Radio Ranch website, www.radio-ranch.comfor a look behind the scenes of radio commer-\ncial production.\nMedia planners use radio to deliver a high level of frequency because radio commercials,\nparticularly jingles, which are commercials set to music, lend themselves to repetition. Barry\nManilow was awarded an Honorary CLIO Award recognizing his long career as a jingle writer.\nOne of his best known is the catchy Band-Ad jingle, “I am stuck on Band-Aid brand cuz Band-\nAid’s stuck on me.” Hear this classic at www.youtube.com/watch?v(cid:4)_7MtLNK02lI.\nRadio can also engage the imagination more than other media because it relies on the lis-\ntener’s mind to fill in the visual element.
