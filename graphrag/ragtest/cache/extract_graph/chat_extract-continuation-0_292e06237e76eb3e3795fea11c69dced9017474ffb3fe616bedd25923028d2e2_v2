Values segmentation reflects consumers’underlying value system—spiritual, hedonistic,\nthrifty, and so forth. Benefit segmentation is based on consumers’needs or problems. The idea\nis that people buy products for different benefits they hope to derive.

In the United States, the Census Bureau compiles a huge\ncollection of demographic information every 10 years—the most recent census was in 2010.\nAge The most important demographic characteristic used by advertising planners is age. Peo-\nple of different ages have different needs and wants. An advertising message must be geared to\nthe target audience’s age group and should be delivered through a medium that members of the\ngroup use. But age also determines product choice. How old are you? What products did you use\n5 or 10 years ago that you don’t use now? Look ahead 10 years. What products might you be in-\nterested in buying in the future that you don’t buy now?\nTable 5.1 U.S. Population Age Breakdowns\nGroup In Millions %\n9 and younger 41.1 13.5\n10–19 41.6 13.7\n20–34 62.0 20.0\n35–44 42.5 14.0\n45–54 44.4 14.6\n55–64 34.0 11.2\n65–74 20.1 7.0\n75–84 13.0 4.2\n85 and older 5.7 1.8\nSource: American Fact Finder, U.S. Census Bureau, retrieved September 9, 2009, from http://factfinder\n.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm(cid:4)y&-qr_name(cid:4)PEP_2008_EST_DP1&-geo_id(cid:4)01000US&-ds_name(cid:4)\nPEP_2008_EST&-_lang(cid:4)en&-format(cid:4)&-CONTEXT(cid:4)qt.\n140 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nConsider the age categories in the following list and the breakdowns in Table 5.1.
