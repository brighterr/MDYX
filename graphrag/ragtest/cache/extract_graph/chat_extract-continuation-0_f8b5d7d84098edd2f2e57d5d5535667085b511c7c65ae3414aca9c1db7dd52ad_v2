AOL, for example, assembles a huge database of cus-\ntomer information, some of which it sells to other direct marketers. It admits this practice in its pri-\nvacy policy, which is published on its website. It also buys information about its subscribers from\nother outside database suppliers, which it can use to better target its customers’interests. And that’s\nthe primary reason companies collect this type of information: It lets them better target their adver-\ntising messages and theoretically be more selective in how they contact customers and prospects.\nMany companies try to maintain a responsible position by posting their privacy policy on\ntheir websites, which details, among other things, how or whether the site is collecting data on its\nvisitors and how those data are used. Sometimes this information is easy to find, sometimes it is\nburied on the site and difficult to access, and in some instances the website doesn’t have any pub-\nCompanies can earn\ntheir customers’ trust lished privacy statement at all.

Would it The FCC reached a settlement in 2008 with Sears over allegations that the retailer failed to\nmake a difference\nadequately inform consumers about how much Sears was tracking their behaviors. Congress is\nto you?\nlooking into these practices and the industry is trying to head off legal action by taking steps to\nmake their practices more transparent. One proposal, for example, is for an icon that would ap-\npear on Web pages to let consumers know that their activity is being tracked.56 The European\nUnion monitors behavioral targeting practices and even started legal action against the United\nKingdom for permitting behavioral targeting without proper notification to consumers or for not\nrequiring opt-out mechanisms.57\nAdvantages and Limitations of Internet Advertising\nInternet advertising is growing in popularity because it offers some distinct advantages over other\nmedia, in addition to the explosion in its use by consumers. Most notably, it is relatively inexpensive.\nAdvertisers see it as a relatively low-cost alternative to mainstream advertising media. It is also a form\nthat reaches people who aren’t watching much television or reading newspapers. Another benefit of\nInternet advertising is that it is relatively easy to track and reach a highly targeted audience.\nAlso, advertisers can customize and personalize their messages over the Internet. Thanks to\ndatabase marketing,an advertiser can input key demographic and behavioral variables, making\nthe consumer feel like the ad is just for him or her. Check out www.classmates.comfor an exam-\nple. Ads appearing on a particular page are for products that would appeal to a particular age\ngroup. Someone who graduated from high school in 1960 would see banner ads for investments\nthat facilitate retirement as opposed to someone graduating in 2000 who might see career ads.\nFor the B2B advertiser, Internet advertising can provide excellent sales leads or actual sales.\nUsers of a typical B2B site, for example, can access the product catalogs, read the product spec-\nifications in depth, request a call from a salesperson, and make a purchase online.\nThe Internet can level the playing field for small and medium-sized companies that compete\nagainst larger organizations. The cost of creating a website, a set of ads, and a database is afford-\nable for virtually every marketer.\nUndoubtedly, the most serious drawback is the inability of strategic and creative experts to\nconsistently produce effective ads and to measure their effectiveness. Technological limitations\ncan also cause problems for users with low bandwidth or a lack of computer expertise.\nConsider, too, that clutter is just as much a problem with the Internet as it is in other media.\nIn fact, because multiple ads may appear on the same screen—many moving or popping up—the\nclutter may be even worse.\nLooking Ahead\nThis chapter has described the important developments in digital media and how online media\nhave changed the face of marketing communication. In particular, we’ve discussed the implica-\ntions of shape-shifting media and the challenges, as well as opportunities, they create for mar-\nketing communication. The next chapter pulls all of these opportunities together and describes\nhow media planning and buying are managed.\nCHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 415\nIT’S A WRAP\nMission Accomplished\nThe U.S. Army’s traveling Virtual Army Experience effectively reached and built relationships with potential\nrecruits by using media creatively and interactively. In addition to recruiting new soldiers, the VAE at-\ntempted to reshape the public perceptions formed in popular culture to teach young people about the hard\nwork and sacrifice soldiers endure in the service to protect our country’s freedom each day.\n“More than ever before, today’s audience is drawn to a brand they can interact and connect with on a\nmore personal level,” said Lt. Gen. Benjamin C. Freakley, commanding general of U.S. Army Accessions Com-\nmand. “We want our prospects to experience the Army brand in a relevant way, so we infuse experiential op-\nportunities into all of our marketing efforts. That way, our prospects can better understand what it’s really like\nto be a soldier and, therefore, make an informed decision about serving our nation in the Army.” Sgt.
