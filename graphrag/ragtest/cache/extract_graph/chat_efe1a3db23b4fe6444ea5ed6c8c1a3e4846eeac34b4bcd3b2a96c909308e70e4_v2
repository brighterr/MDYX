Note that the term strategic communication is more often used than\nIMC in public relations programs. As one researcher observed, “In IMC, company assets and\nproduct assets are managed at the same time.”23In many companies, advertising and public rela-\ntions are separate, uncoordinated functions. People working in public relations are often trained\nas journalists, with little background in marketing, and they focus on corporate image rather than\nproduct sales. These different orientations can sometimes create inconsistencies in an organiza-\ntion’s communication efforts.\nPublic relations uses a variety of marketing communication tools just as advertising does.\nAdvertising is particularly useful in corporate image and reputation programs. Direct marketing\nis sometimes useful in sending out corporate books and DVDs. The Internet is important because\nthe corporate website is one of the primary ways to disseminate information about an organiza-\ntion. PR activities, such as publicity and special mailings of DVDs, can help drive traffic to the\ncorporate website. Sales promotion is used in support of PR activities, such as special events. In\nsome cases, it’s hard to know whether an event is a sales promotion or public relations effort.\nBut it’s not just the use of these tools that makes PR a viable IMC function, it’s also the fact that\nPR can contribute valuable effects, such as credibility.\nAstudyconductedbyAdvertisingAgeandtheCouncilofPublicRelationsFirmsaskedmar-\nketersinwhatrolestheyconsideredpublicrelationseffective.Theyrespondedthatraisingaware-\nness was most effective (83 percent), followed by providing credibility (67 percent), reaching\ninfluencers(63percent),educatingconsumers(61percent),promptingtrialuseofproducts(28per-\ncent),persuadingskeptics(22percent),anddrivingsales(22percent).24Theyalsoindicatedthat\nthemostimportantcontributiontomarketingprogramsisinprovidingmediacontacts(67percent).\nThe same study suggested that PR and advertising need to merge or at least find common\nground as the media fragments and consumers gain more control of their time and media habits.\nMessages aimed at reaching mass audiences in the shifting media environment are less effective,\nCHAPTER 15 • PUBLIC RELATIONS 471\nand new opportunities are emerging for public relations,\npublicity, and product placements to be integral parts of in-\ntegrated marketing communication programs One way that\nadvertising and PR have worked together is in the Ad Coun-\ncil’s work, such as the classic Smokey the Bear campaign.\nWHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON\nTYPES OF PUBLIC RELATIONS TOOLS?\nThe public relations practitioner has many tools, which we\ncan divide into two categories: controlled media and uncon-\ntrolled media. Controlled media include house ads, public\nservice announcements, corporate (institutional) advertising,\nin-house publications, and visual presentations. The sponsor-\ning organizations pay for these media. In turn, the sponsor\nmaintains total control over how and when the message is de-\nlivered. Uncontrolled media include press releases, press\nconferences, and media tours. The most recent new media are\nelectronic, which might be categorized as semi-controlled\nmedia.Corporations and businesses control their own web-\nsites, for example, but other websites (particularly those that\nare set up by critics and disgruntled ex-employees), blogs,\nCLASSIC\nand chat rooms about the company are not controlled.\nAn early animated television commercial for Smokey Bear can\nLikewise, companies set special events and sponsor-\nbe seen at www.youtube.com/watch?v5mLdaj8n_zto.Smokey\nships in place, but participation by the press and other im-\nholds a poster with the famous slogan “Only You Can Prevent\nportant publics is not under the control of the sponsoring\nForest Fires.”\ncompany. Word of mouth, or buzz, is important to PR pro-\ngrams because of the persuasive power of personal conver-\nsation. PR programs, particularly employee communication programs, may be designed to\ninfluence what people say about the company, but ultimately the comments are outside the com-\npany’s control. Table 15.1summarizes these tools.\nTable 15.1 Public Relations Tools\nControlled Media Uncontrolled Media\n(company controls the use and placement) (media controls the use and placement)\n• House ads • News release (print, audio, video, e-mail, faxes)\n• Public service ads • Features (pitch letters)\n• Corporate, institutional, advocacy advertising • Fillers, historical pieces, profiles\n• Publications: brochures, flyers, magazines, newsletters • The press conference and media advisory (media kits,\n• Annual reports fact sheets, background info)\n• Speakers • Media tours\n• Photographs • Bylined articles, op-ed pieces, letters to the editor\n• Films, videos, CD-ROMs • Talk and interview shows\n• Displays, exhibits • Public service announcements\n• Staged events\n• Books\nSemi-Controlled Media\n(some aspects are controlled or initiated by the company, but other aspects aren’t)\n• Electronic communication (websites, chat rooms)\n• Special events and sponsorships\n• Word of mouth (buzz)\n• Weblogs (blogs)\n472 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IM\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
