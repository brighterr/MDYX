You bet.\nbreaking through awareness, breaking the inertia trance, and breaking the relevance trance.\nHere’s how the campaign performed on those objectives. Notice the mix of perception, image,\nand behavioral measures.\nObjective 1:Breaking through Awareness\n• Awareness of the Brown campaign outpaced allpast UPS advertising measured in the\n10-plus-year history of its brand tracking study.\n• Amongthoseawareofthecampaign,correctbrandlinkagetoUPSwas95to98percentacross\nallaudiences(comparedtoahistoricalaverageof20to40percentforpastUPSadvertising).\nCHAPTER 19 • EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS 601\n• “What Can BROWN Do for You?” has taken hold in popular culture. For instance, the\ntagline was mentioned in both Saturday Night LiveandTrading Spacesshows.\nObjective 2:Breaking the Inertia Trance\n• With shipping decision makers, the brand showed steady and significant gains in key mea-\nsures like “Helps my operation run more smoothly,” “Dynamic and energetic,” and “Offers a\nbroad range of services.”\n• International shipping profitability increased 150 percent, and overnight volume spiked by\n9.1 percent after the campaign ran. The targeted companies’total package volume increased\nby 4.39 percent.\n• From the start of the campaign in March to the year-end, annual ground shipping revenue\ngrew by $300 million.\n• The campaign was a hit in terms of response with a 10.5 percent response rate and an ROI of\n1:3.5. In other words, every dollar spent on the campaign generated $3.5 dollars in revenue.\nObjective 3:Breaking the Relevance Trance\n• For the first time in the 10-plus-year history of the brand tracking study, UPS leads FedEx in\nall image measures among senior-level decision makers. All significant brand image measures\ncontinued upward.\n• Among senior decision makers, the biggest gains were in key measures like “For people like\nme,” “Acts as a strategic partner to my company,” “Helps in distribution and supply chain\noperations,” and “Provides global competitive advantage.”\n• At the start of the campaign, annual nonpackage (supply chain) revenue was approxi-\nmately $1.4 billion. By the end of the year, nonpackage revenue had almost doubled to\n$2.7 billion.\nBringing It All Together Beyond connecting the objectives to the measurements, advertisers\ncontinue to search for methods that will bring all the metrics together and efficiently and effec-\ntively evaluate—and predict—brand communication effectiveness. Asmall Florida agency, Zim-\nmerman Advertising, positions itself specifically on that issue. It promises to deliver long-term\nbrand building as well as short-term sales. The president explains, “The biggest problem mar-\nketers face today is connecting advertising to retail sales.” To help determine the impact of its ads\non sales, Zimmerman measures ad response immediately using a toll-free number and proprietary\nsoftware that tracks sales to specific ads.28\nThe giant media research company, Nielsen, has undertaken a project to find the links in its\nvarious marketing metrics. In particular, the company wants to connect its Nielsen Media Re-\nsearch TVratings with its A.C. Nielsen retail scanner and consumer panel data. Then it wants to\nmix in data from its Nielsen/NetRatings for online advertising and Nielsen Buzzmetrics online-\nbuzz measurement system.29This is just one example of how important it is to connect the dots\nto draw an accurate picture of consumer response to marketing communication.\nUltimately,thegoalistoarriveatholistic,cross-functionalmetricsthatarerelevantforin-\ntegratedcommunication,ataskundertakenbyDellComputersanditsagencyDDB.GivenDell’s\ndirect-marketingbusinessmodel,thecompanyhadextensivecallandorderdatainitsdatabase.\nDDBhelpedorganizethecollectionofdetailedmarcominformation,whichmadeitpossibleto\nbeginlinkingorderstospecificmarcomactivities.ThisnewmarcomROItrackingsystemmade\nitpossibleforDelltorecognizea3percentgainintheefficiencyofitsmarketingcommunication.\nAsthemetricssystembecamemoresophisticated,italsobegantomovefromareportingandmet-\nricsevaluationenginetoastrateg\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNITED AIRLINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>United Airlines is a major airline company that faced criticism for poor customer service, particularly highlighted by an incident involving a broken Taylor guitar<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>UPS is a global package delivery and supply chain management company known for its \"What Can BROWN Do for You?\" campaign<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZIMMERMAN ADVERTISING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Zimmerman Advertising is a Florida-based agency focused on connecting advertising to retail sales through innovative metrics<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NIELSEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nielsen is a media research company working on integrating various marketing metrics, including TV ratings and online advertising data<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELL COMPUTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dell Computers is a technology company that implemented a sophisticated marketing communication ROI tracking system<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED AIRLINES<|>UPS<|>Both companies are mentioned in the context of marketing and customer service strategies<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UPS<|>ZIMMERMAN ADVERTISING<|>Zimmerman Advertising focuses on connecting advertising to sales, similar to UPS's marketing strategies<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NIELSEN<|>DELL COMPUTERS<|>Both companies are involved in developing sophisticated metrics systems for marketing communication<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
