Exhibits tend to be larger than displays; they may have moving parts, sound, or video and\nusually are staffed by a company representative. Booth exhibits are important at trade shows,\nwhere some companies may take orders for much of their annual sales.\nSpecial Events and Tours Some companies stage events to celebrate milestones, such as key\nanniversaries and introductions of new products. Toy company Mattel celebrated Barbie’s\n50th birthday by re-releasing a dozen retired models to celebrate different eras, such as Bar-\nbie in 1970s bell bottoms and as an 80s rocker with a spiky pink wig. Her birthday party in-\ncluded an appearance at New York’s Fashion Week with outfits designed by top fashion\ndesigners.33\nThese are high-visibility activities designed to get maximum publicity. Special events can\nbe the public relations manager’s responsibility as well as a sales promotion activity. The use of\nfancy staged events has seen the most growth. Corporate sponsorship of various sporting events\nlike golf tournaments and car races has evolved into a favorite public relations tactic.\nNonprofits also use events as promotional opportunities. For example, the American Mu-\nseum of Natural History used a coordinated, branded media event to announce the unveiling of a\n47-million-year-old fossil. The event was timed to coincide with an article in a scientific journal,\nas well as a History Channel film, a book release, an exclusive news arrangement with ABC, and\na website.34\nThomas Harris, cofounder of Golin/Harris Communications, considers Steve Jobs to be one of\nthe world’s greatest public relations people. When Jobs took the stage to announce the Apple iPhone,\nthe product launch generated an estimated $400 million in free\npublicity. According to Harris, by the time the iPhone went on\nsale six months later, it had already been the subject of 11,000\nprint articles and had generated 69 million hits on Google for\nwhat bloggers were calling the “Jesus phone.” Jobs repeated\nthe feat with the announcement of Apple’s iPad, generating\nlots of buzz for its new tablet. Harris also had to do damage\ncontrol with a large press conference when the new iPhone 4\nwas panned for its antenna problems.\nEvents can also be important for internal communica-\ntion. Learning objectives and employee buy-in for a new\ncampaign are often accomplished through meetings, semi-\nnars, and workshops sponsored by a company, typically in\nconjunction with training materials and other publications.\nTo facilitate internal marketing, town hall forumsare some-\ntimes used. Forums provide management with an opportu-\nnity to make a presentation on some major project, initiative,\nor issue and invite employees to discuss it.\nInadditiontomediatours,toursofallkindsareusedin\npublic relations programs, such as plant tours and trips by\ndelegatesandrepresentatives.Youareprobablyfamiliarwith\none form—the campus tour used by colleges in recruiting\nnewstudents.Realizingtheimportanceoftheseevents,some\ncollegesarehiringconsultingcompaniestotrainthevolun-\nteer guides in appearance, presentation, and more relaxed\n“walks” designed to give a better sense of what makes a\nschooldistinctive.\nTheSpokaneRegionalConventionandVisitorsBureau\nandtheInternationalTradeAllianceinSpokane,Washington,\nteameduptotraveltoCalgary,Alberta,topromoteSpokane\nasanareafortradeandtourism.Thirty-sevenSpokanebusi-\nness leaders, travel suppliers, and trade professionals em-\nSteve Jobs unveils the iPad, generating lots of buzz for the barked on the four-day mission to Calgary.
