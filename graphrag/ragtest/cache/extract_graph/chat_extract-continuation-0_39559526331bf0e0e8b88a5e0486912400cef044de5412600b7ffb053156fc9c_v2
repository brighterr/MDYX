If you include a toll-free 800 number\nin your mailing as an alternative to the standard mail-in reply—with well-trained, knowledgeable\npeople handling those incoming calls with a carefully thought-out script—you can achieve a 3 to\n4 percent response rate. If you follow up your mailing with a phone call within 24 to 72 hours af-\nter your prospect receives the mailing, you can generate a response two to eight times as high as\nthe base rate of 2 percent. So, by adding your 800 number, you bring the response rate from 2 per-\ncent to 3 or 4 percent. By following up with phone calls, you bring your total response rate as high\nas 5 to 18 percent.\nThe principle behind integration is that not all people respond the same way to direct-\nresponse messages. One person may carefully fill out the order form. Someone else may imme-\ndiately call the 800 number. Most people, if a DMC message grabs them, tend to put it in the\npending pile. That pile grows and grows, and then goes into the garbage at the end of the month.\nBut, if a phone call or e-mail follows the direct-mail piece, the marketer may get the wavering\nconsumer off the fence. Hewlett-Packard, AT&T, Citibank, and IBM have all used integrated di-\nrect marketing as a multimedia effort to improve their direct marketing response rates.\nSafeway Stores has become interested in integrated direct marketing. Essentially, Safeway\nhas signed up manufacturers such as the Quaker Oats Company and Stouffer Food Corp. (owned\nby Nestlé) for a database marketing program that provides trade dollars in exchange for quality\ncustomer data. The program exemplifies the convergence of two trends: grocers looking for man-\nufacturers to supplement their own shrunken marketing budgets and manufacturers eager to allo-\ncate new field marketing support dollars are working more closely as partners. A number of\nmanufacturers whose products are carried in Safeway stores fund Safeway’s quarterly mailings\nin exchange for in-store support and sales data.\nAcommon problem with IDM is that direct marketing messages and advertising messages\noften do not reinforce each other as well as they should because the two functions—advertising\nand direct marketing, which often are handled by different agencies—don’t talk to one another.\nThis will change, however, as clients demand more coordination of their marketing communica-\ntion programs.
