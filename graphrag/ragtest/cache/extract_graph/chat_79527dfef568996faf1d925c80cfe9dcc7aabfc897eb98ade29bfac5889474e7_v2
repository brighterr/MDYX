But the difference is that the media deals are pack-\naged around a cause, such as the environment or wellness. Campbell Soup, for example, spon-\nsored health segments on NBC’s The Today Show, as well as Dr. Nancy Snyderman’s MSNBC\nhealth program.18The idea is to match the media use of the target audience in all its complexity.\nNewspapers have long offered simplified buys through such companies as Nationwide\nNewspapers, which can handle classified and display advertising in more than 21,000 newspa-\npers. The Newspaper National Network is a trade association representing some 9,000 newspa-\npers that also handles ad placement. In the digital world, DoubleClick’s DARTfor Advertisers\n(DFA) service helps advertisers manage online display and search marketing campaigns across\nonline channels.

However, many are thinking about it, especially computer and\nother information technology companies that are being pursued by media such as CNN. Today,\nthe growth area is media buys across a single region. As media become more global, however,\nsome marketers are beginning to make the leap across regions. About 60 percent of ad buys on\nCNN International are regional, and 40 percent are global.\nIn Europe, the rise of buying “centrals” came about with the emergence of the European\nUnion and the continuing globalization of trade and advertising. Buying centralsare media or-\nganizations that buy across several European countries. Their growth also began with the devel-\nopment of commercial broadcasting and the expansion of media choices. These firms have\nflourished in an environment of flexible and negotiated rates, low inflation, and a fragmented ad-\nvertising market. The buying centrals have nearly three-fourths of the media market in France,\nnine-tenths in Spain, and about two-fifths in Britain, Holland, Italy, and Scandinavia.\nThe important thing, however, is to be able to consider cultural implications in media use.\nFor that reason media planning and buying companies are also specializing or buying companies\nthat know specific cultures, such as the Hispanic market in the United States and the Chinese mar-\nket in Asia. Zenithoptimedia, for example, is a global media-buying company that has created ZO\nMulticultural, a multicultural unit that helps clients trying to reach ethnic markets.\nMedia Planning and Buying Trends\nAdvertising experts have been proclaiming the demise of mass media advertising for a number\nof years. It reached a high buzz level when Bob Garfield, an Advertising Age columnist, got\nindustry-wide attention with his book, The Chaos Scenario,in which he speculated about the me-\ndia landscape in coming years when over-the-air network TVis gone and everyone accesses their\nnews, entertainment, and advertising any way they wish: TV, phone, camera, laptop, game con-\nsole, or MP3 player. His concept of “listenomics” emphasizes the importance of consumer-in-\ncharge media choices.19\nThe truth is that the media landscape is dynamic and changing so fast that it’s hard to keep\ntrack of how the media business is practiced. All of these changes create new ways of operation\nand new opportunities for innovative media planners and buyers.\nCHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 451\nUnbundling Media Buying and Planning We’ve mentioned before the growth of media-buying\nservices, such as the media megashop Starcom MediaVest, as separate companies that specialize\nin media buying. This is a shift in the way the media industry is organized, a change referred to\nasunbundling media services.This happens when an agency transforms its media department\ninto a separate profit center, apart from the agency. This then allows the media group to work for\nclients who may be competitors to some of those handled by the agency. Because these compa-\nnies control the money, they have become a powerful force in the advertising industry, leading to\na tug of war over control of planning. Faced with competition from these independent media com-\npanies, many large agencies\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
