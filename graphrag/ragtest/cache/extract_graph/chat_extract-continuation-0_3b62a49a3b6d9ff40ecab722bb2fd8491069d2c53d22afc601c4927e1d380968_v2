Arecent study led by the giant Paris-based agency Publicis with\nMicrosoft, Yahoo!, CBS, and Hulu, the website portal for streaming TVprogramming, as part-\nners, tested a number of these formats and concluded that the best way to deliver video ads is\nthrough an ad selector,a feature that offers a group of ads and invites viewers to choose one. The\ntest found that consumers are more likely to watch and remember video ads if they are able to\npick the ones they watch.25\nSearch Advertising Estimates for the percentage of Internet advertising that goes to sites con-\nPrinciple\nnected with search advertising range from 50 to 80 percent, which indicates how important the\nSearch marketing is the\nsearch function is for consumers and the marketers who are trying to reach them.26 ultimate in brand linkage\nSearch engine advertising is driven by keywords that consumers use to search for informa- and association because it\ntion. The reason why the consumer search function is so important is that it provides the marketer provides the opportunity\nwith an opportunity to position a brand message adjoining the list of sites (articles, blogs, to put an ad on a page\nWikipedia entries) that is compiled in response to a keyword by search engines. This practice is delivered by a keyword\ncalledsearch marketing.With a credit card and a few minutes, a small business owner can set search.\nup a link between his or her brand and a keyword or key terms, such as “chocolate éclairs” or\n“real estate staging.” It’s the ultimate in brand linkage and association.\nSearch providers, such as Google, MSN, and Yahoo!, auction off positions that let advertis-\ners’ads be seen next to specific search results. This has brought a fountain of money to Google\nover the years. These related ads are priced based on the number of consumer clicks on the ad,\nwith rates averaging around 50 cents per click. To explore how this works, “google” the term\nAdWordsand you will find dozens of sites by experts who help businesses construct their search\nmarketing campaigns. Microsoft’s Bing.comand Google’s “Goggles” also offer visual searches\nthat display search results as pictures, rather than words. You can search for pink tennis shoes or\ntitanium tennis rackets and get a response in pictures.\nBecause consumers initiate the search, the adjoining ads are not perceived to be as intrusive\nas other forms of advertising. People do hundreds of millions of searches a day, and businesses\nspend billions to have their ads displayed next to the results. A benefit of online consumer\nsearches is that they leave a trail of clues about products, features, and advertising approaches.\nThis behavior can be mined for insights that lead to new products.\n404 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nArecent development is Google’s foray into real-time search,which not only produces the\nusual search results, but also lets Google supplement the results with updates posted each second\non social media, such as Facebook and Twitter.27This mix of search and social media will only\nincrease the speed with which brand messages spread and will challenge the ability of companies\nto monitor their brands’online presence.\nSearch optimization is the practice of maximizing the link between topics and brand-\nrelated websites. Companies try to affect their search engine rankings in order to drive more traf-\nfic to their websites. They want their ads to appear as close to the top of the list as possible in\norder to have maximum visibility. An important first step for marketers in creating a viable web-\nsite is getting it registered with popular search engines so that it shows up early on the list pro-\nvided by the search engine.\nClassified Ads A small part of the online advertising piece, classified advertising, whether\nthrough local media websites or Craigslist, is still used by local advertisers and organizations.\nPreviously the golden goose for local newspapers, the move to online “want ads” has been a big\nreason why local newspapers are in trouble financially. Craigslist is a community exchange for\npeople who either want to sell something or are looking for something. Its business model is to\noperate as a public service. It doesn’t accept advertising but does charge for real estate listings\nand open-job postings.\nCraigslist does have a problem with spammers who have automated the mass posting of ads,\nwhich has caused grief for customers and led to lawsuits by Craigslist. The company is also su-\ning a San Francisco company that runs a look-alike, “parasite” site called Craigsup. Other legal\nissues focus on its adult category, which carries explicit sexual-service ads.28\nInternet Ad Sales The market for online display ads was estimated at $21 billion a year in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PUBLICIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Publicis is a giant Paris-based advertising agency that led a study on video ad formats)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is a technology company that partnered with Publicis in a study on video ad formats)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YAHOO!<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yahoo! is a web services provider that partnered with Publicis in a study on video ad formats)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CBS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CBS is a major American television and radio network that partnered with Publicis in a study on video ad formats)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HULU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hulu is a website portal for streaming TV programming that partnered with Publicis in a study on video ad formats)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google is a search engine company that offers search advertising and real-time search capabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MSN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MSN is a web portal and related collection of Internet services and apps for Windows and mobile devices, provided by Microsoft)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BING.COM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bing.com is a search engine owned by Microsoft that offers visual searches)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAIGSLIST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Craigslist is a community exchange website for buying and selling goods and services, known for its classified ads)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAIGSUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Craigsup is a look-alike site to Craigslist, involved in legal issues with Craigslist)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUBLICIS<|>MICROSOFT<|>Publicis partnered with Microsoft in a study on video ad formats<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUBLICIS<|>YAHOO!<|>Publicis partnered with Yahoo! in a study on video ad formats<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUBLICIS<|>CBS<|>Publicis partnered with CBS in a study on video ad formats<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUBLICIS<|>HULU<|>Publicis partnered with Hulu in a study on video ad formats<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE<|>MSN<|>Google and MSN are both search providers that auction off ad positions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE<|>BING.COM<|>Google and Bing.com are both search engines offering visual searches<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAIGSLIST<|>CRAIGSUP<|>Craigslist is suing Craigsup for being a look-alike, \"parasite\" site<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
