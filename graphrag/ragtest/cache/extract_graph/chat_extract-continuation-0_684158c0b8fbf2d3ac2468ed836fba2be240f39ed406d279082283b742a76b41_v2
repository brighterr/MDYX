Increasingly, retail\nfood and drug chains are giving more space and promotional support to their own store brands,\nalso called private-label brandsorhouse brands.\nThe three basic types of retail stores are those that are independently ownedsuch as a barber\nshop, those that are part of a franchisesuch as KFC and Hertz, and those that are owned by a ma-\njorcorporationsuch as Starbucks and Macy’s. Retailers such as Sears, Staples, Home Depot, and\nBest Buy advertise nationally and locally.

More than just retail websites for exist-\ning stores, the iTunes and iApp electronic storefronts have created a new face for retail selling—\nnot just to people sitting at their computers, but also to those using mobile media wherever they\nmay be. Technology is changing shopping. Aboutique in Manhattan, for example, offers a new\nway to shop using a cell phone—shoppers standing outside a store window, even if the store is\nclosed, can point the phone at merchandise and buy it.9\nRetail Communication Planning\nAs mentioned previously, retailers sell not only a range of product brands, they also sell themselves\nas destinations for buying a selection of products. Apositive, distinctive image is a valuable asset\nand especially important for upscale retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue. Retailers who want to build\na brand image, particularly an upscale one, must clearly and consistently communicate that image\nto consumers through advertising, other forms of marketing communication, pricing strategies, lo-\ncation, and the physical appearance of the store.\nRetail Objectives Customers base their decisions about where to shop on the quality of the\nshopping experience, as well as on such retail decision factors as choice, selection, and service.\nThese, in turn, affect retail marcom objectives.\nThe primary objective is to build store traffic,which marketing communication does by fea-\nturing reduced prices on popular items and promoting an appealing store image and shopping ex-\nperience. In addition to traffic, most retailers use advertising to help attract new customers, build\nstore loyalty, increase the amount of the average sale, maintain inventory balance by moving out\n552 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\noverstocks and outdated merchandise, and\ncounter seasonal lows (see Figure 18.2).
