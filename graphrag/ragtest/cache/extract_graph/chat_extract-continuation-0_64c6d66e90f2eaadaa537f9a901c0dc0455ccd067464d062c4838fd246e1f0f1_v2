promotion that demonstrates how a variety of media and\ntools can work together was the Voyeur Project for HBO that won a Grand Prix at the Cannes\nFilm Festival. The idea for the promotional campaign was to project a massive film on the wall\nof a building in New York showing the illusion of looking inside eight fictional apartments. Each\napartment and its inhabitants depicted a different story, which reinforced HBO’s position as “the\ngreatest storyteller in the world.”\nItwasalsoanevent—streetteamspassedoutinvitationstotheshowings,whichwereheldat\ndifferenttimesonastreetinNewYork.Streetviewerscouldholduptheirinvitationsandseeclues\naboutthestorylinesandtheyalsocouldinteractthroughmobilemessaging.Viewersathomecould\ngoonlineandzoominonthevariousstories,ortheycouldgotoHBOOnDemandandseethe\nfilmTheWatcherthattiedinwithoneofthestorylinesaboutanassassinmurderinganFBIagent.\nCreated by BBDO and a team of partner agencies, other content about the storylines was\nfound online on Web mini-sites, as well as in photo and video clips on social media platforms,\nsuch as Flickr and YouTube. It was an event, an outdoor advertising experience, an online expe-\nrience, and it involved many bloggers who followed the stories and commented to their digital\ncommunities. See the film at www.youtube.com/watch?v(cid:4)QCr853VVo9c\nPromotion Effectiveness\nBecause promotions are so focused on action, it makes sense that sales volume is the primary\nmeasure of their effectiveness. After all, they are called sales promotions. Response rate—\nconsumers calling the company, sending back a card—is also important to sales promotion. So\nare redemption rates, which are the rates at which people redeem coupons, refunds, and rebates.\nThese rates are used to evaluate the effectiveness of promotional programs. All of these will be\ndiscussed in more detail in Chapter 19.\nAn important dimension of sales promotion effectiveness is payout planning. The goal of\ncreating a payout plan is to produce promotions that increase sales and profits. Needless to say, a\npromotion should not cost the company more money than it brings in.\nAnexampleofpoorpayoutplanningcomesfromMaytagandanill-fatedU.K.promotion.It\nwasasimpleoffer:CustomersinGreatBritainandIrelandwereofferedtwofreeairlineticketsto\ntheUnitedStatesorContinentalEuropewhentheypurchasedatleast$150worthofHooverprod-\nucts.Hooverplannedtousethecommissionsitmadefromlandarrangements,suchashotelreser-\nvations and car rentals, to help pay for the airline tickets.

Such fail-\nures hurt companies’reputations, waste money, and sometimes even hurt consumers. For exam-\nple, Burger King once had to recall 400,000 toy boats given away with kids’meals after reports\nthat children had been stuck with metal pins that came off the boats too easily. That recall came\na week after McDonald’s recalled a Happy Meal “Scooter Bug” toy. In 1999 the fast-food indus-\ntry reeled from the deaths of two infants who suffocated from containers used in a Pokémon pro-\nmotion. About 25 million of those toys were recalled.\nCHAPTER 17 • PROMOTIONS 541\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GERWIN<|>PERSON<|>Gerwin is a marketing consultant who emphasizes the importance of a common strategy and shared objectives in marketing to build shareholder value and increase stock price)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOYEUR PROJECT<|>EVENT<|>The Voyeur Project was a multiplatform promotional campaign for HBO that involved projecting a film on a building in New York, depicting stories in fictional apartments, and won a Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HBO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HBO is a television network known for its storytelling, which conducted the Voyeur Project promotional campaign)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANNES FILM FESTIVAL<|>EVENT<|>The Cannes Film Festival is a prestigious film festival where the Voyeur Project won a Grand Prix)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BBDO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BBDO is an advertising agency that, along with partner agencies, created the Voyeur Project for HBO)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYTAG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Maytag is a company that experienced a promotional failure in the U.K. with a Hoover product offer that led to customer dissatisfaction and executive firings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOOVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hoover is a brand under Maytag that ran a problematic promotion offering free airline tickets, which resulted in a financial and reputational setback)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURGER KING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Burger King is a fast-food chain that had to recall toy boats from kids' meals due to safety issues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCDONALD'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McDonald's is a fast-food chain that recalled a Happy Meal toy due to safety concerns)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOYEUR PROJECT<|>HBO<|>The Voyeur Project was a promotional campaign conducted by HBO<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOYEUR PROJECT<|>CANNES FILM FESTIVAL<|>The Voyeur Project won a Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BBDO<|>VOYEUR PROJECT<|>BBDO created the Voyeur Project for HBO<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYTAG<|>HOOVER<|>Hoover is a brand under Maytag that ran a problematic promotion<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BURGER KING<|>MCDONALD'S<|>Both Burger King and McDonald's faced issues with toy recalls due to safety concerns<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
