In simpler terms, by knowing your consumers’past behavior, you\ncan decide how much you want to spend to get them to purchase and then repurchase your prod-\nuct, and you can track your investment by measuring the response.\nConsumer resistance to direct marketing must be considered in efforts to build loyalty.\nChanging consumers’attitudes about direct marketing has not been easy because consumers\nresent companies that know too much about them. If the company can demonstrate that it is act-\ning in the consumer’s best interest rather than just trolling for dollars, it might gain and maintain\nconsumers’loyalty. Saks Fifth Avenue, for example, identified the customers who account for half\nof all sales and offered the group exclusive benefits through a program called Saks First. The ben-\nefits include fashion newsletters and a first crack at all sales.\nThe most important goal, however, is supporting brand building, and some marketers have\nbeen concerned that DMC’s emphasis on accountability and emphasis on driving sales has made\nit less focused on the brand presence. One back-end operation, GSI Interactive, which had been\nknown for its handling of online sales, created a spin-off called True Action that is tasked with\n512 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nthe mission of building brands. The point is that, as a True Action executive observed, if the\nagency doesn’t understand the base business, “they can make dumb decisions.”21\nGlobal Considerations in DMC\nThe direct marketing industry is growing fast in many Far Eastern and European countries—in\nsome places, even faster than in the United States. The global trend is fueled by the same tech-\nnological forces driving the growth of direct marketing in this country: the increasing use of com-\nputer databases, credit cards, toll-free phone numbers, and the Internet, along with the search for\nmore convenient ways to shop. The growth may be even greater in business-to-business market-\ning than in consumer marketing.\nDirect marketing is particularly important in countries that have tight restrictions on adver-\ntising and other forms of marketing communication. However, these countries often have re-\nstrictions on direct marketing as well. Privacy issues are even more intense in some countries than\nin the United States. In some countries, lists are not available, or they may be of poor quality.\nDatabases can be more freely transferred between European countries than they can between the\nUnited States and European countries.\nSome countries have instituted outright bans on direct marketing, although these restrictions\nseem to be loosening up. China lifted its national ban on direct sales, such as Amway and Avon,\nin late 2005. The ban had been in place since 1998 because of a series of scandals and frauds.22\nGovernmental regulation of the postal service may also place limitations on the use of direct\nmail. For example, language and characters are a problem, particularly for American companies\nthat may not understand that the letter eisn’t the same as é,è,ê,orëin an address. Computers\nand typesetting systems have to accommodate these differences. The format of the address has to\nbe exactly correct in some countries, such as Germany, where the Deutsche Post has strict rules\nabout correct address formats. In Hungary the street name is in the third line of the address,\nwhereas it is on the second line along with the postal code in Germany. Presorted mail in a wrong\nformat may result in charges to the end user that significantly raise the cost of the mailing.\nWhat Are the Advantages and Limitations of DMC\nIn addition to interactivity, which is its greatest gift to marketing communicators, another big ad-\nvantage of direct marketing over indirect marketing, such as advertising, can be summarized in\none word: accountability. DMAdescribes this strength as the ability to track, measure, and opti-\nmize marketing communication.23Other advantages include the following:\n• Direct marketing messages can be personalized, which makes them much more persuasive\nthan nonpersonalized (mass-media) messages.\n• Direct marketing results are measurable so the ROI is easily known.\n• Direct marketing technology allows for the collection of relevant information about the cus-\ntomer, contributing to the development of a useful database and selective reach, which re-\nduces waste.\n• Products have added value, through the convenient purchase process and reliable/quick de-\nlivery mechanisms of direct marketing. Purchase is not restricted to a location.\n• The marketer controls the product (rather than the wholesaler or retailer) until delivery.\n• Advertising carrying direct marketing components is more effective than advertising not us-\ning direct marketing.\n• Direct marketing affords flexibility both in form and timing.\nLike all tools, direct marketing has some weaknesses. Most notably, consumers are still re-\nluctant to purchase a product they cannot touch and feel. Another weakness is the annoyance as-\nsociated with direct marketing, such as too many catalogs, junk mail, online pop-ups, ad clutter,\nspam e-mail, and unwelcome phone calls. There are serious problems with customer privacy and\ndata sharing as well as concerns about identity theft. Finally, in the tension between creating a\nlong-term brand image and driving immediate sales, direct marketing tends to be more attuned to\nthe latter. But that doesn’t mean brand building is impossible with direct marketing. In particular,\ndirect marketers, such as L.L.Bean, Amazon.com, Nature Conservancy, and Dell Computer, have\nbuilt strong brands primarily through direct marketing.\nCHAPTER 16 • DIRECT RESPONSE 513\nLooking Ahead\nDirect-response marketing communication is an important tool in the IMC toolkits because it is\nuniquely designed to deliver interactivity.
