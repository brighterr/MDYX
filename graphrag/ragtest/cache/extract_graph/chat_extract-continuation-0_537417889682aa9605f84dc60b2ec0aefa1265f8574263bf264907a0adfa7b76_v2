Here’s the situation\nyou’re facing. Once the category leader, Nintendo’s sales have plummeted so much\nthat one industry consultant advised your company to abandon the fight to compete\nin the video game war. You think about the formidable rivalry from the Microsoft’s\npopular Xbox 360 and Sony’s PlayStation 3. What do you do? Where do you start?\nWhat makes Nintendo’s Wii campaign Ad Lesson #1is the insightful thinking\nabout those people whom the advertising aims to convince to become Wii con-\nsumers. Think about PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 users. They’re usually male and\navid gamers—guys who like difficult and often violent games. Nintendo could have\nchased those hardcore users. But it didn’t. Instead, Nintendo chose to appeal to\nan audience who’d been turned off by video games—moms, families, even resi-\ndents in nursing homes. Nintendo zigged when the competition zagged.\nSuch a bold strategy was not without risk. Some in the industry scoffed at the\ndaunting task of trying to persuade nonusers to become Wii enthusiasts. Nin-\ntendo’s research showed that nonplayers voiced similar complaints about games\nfor other systems: they were too hard or complicated to learn. The nonplayers said\nthey enjoyed challenging games such as crossword puzzles and Sudoku, partici-\npating in sports leagues, and connecting with other people socially. They weren’t\ngame averse, but they held negative perceptions about video games.\nNintendo responded to the research findings with a Big Idea. Why not invite\nthe nonplayers to participate? Rather than talking about the power of the proces-\nsor or pixel count as its competitors did, the “Wii Would Like to Play” campaign\nfocused on features that made its product different: motion-sensitive controllers\nand prices lower than the competition’s. It lured people off their couches and in-\ntrigued them by showing a wide age range of people—family and friends—who\nactively and interactively played simple games together.\nProving that Wii isn’t just for kids, Nintendo crafted a different kind of mar-\nketing effort for a different kind of video game. Its multimillion-dollar campaign let\npotential consumers touch, see, and experience the new game—Ad Lesson #2.\n33\n34 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nNintendo’s ambassador program featured parties for multigenerational families,\nhard-core gamers, and modern moms. Others experienced Wii at malls, retail mid-\nnight madness events, music/video tours, and online social networking communi-\nties. Before Wii was even launched, it was featured in South Park, showed up on\nthe front page of The Wall Street Journal, and other popular media including\nPeople magazine, NPR, and BusinessWeek.\nOther efforts to spread the word included a MySpace page, which attracted a\nmillion page views, brand partnerships with 7-Eleven, Pringles Snack Stacks, and\nComedy Central. Wii also showed up on the Discovery Channel, Animal Planet,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OVALTINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ovaltine is a long-standing brand similar to Grape Nuts, known for its loyal customer base despite being largely forgotten by most consumers<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAURA ASHLEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Laura Ashley is a brand of apparel and a retailer that has been struggling since the 1990s and has lost much of its popularity<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVAYA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Avaya is a large B2B company with a small presence in the general consumer market, similar to Geico, and could benefit from increased brand awareness<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A&W RESTAURANTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A&W Restaurants is a service that could benefit from brand rejuvenation<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZALE JEWELERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Zale Jewelers is a service that could benefit from brand rejuvenation<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISCOVER CARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Discover Card is a service that could benefit from brand rejuvenation<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASK.COM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ask.com is a service that could benefit from brand rejuvenation<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMTRAK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amtrak is a service that could benefit from brand rejuvenation<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRAVELODGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Travelodge is a service that could benefit from brand rejuvenation<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Anti-Defamation League is a nonprofit organization that promotes respect for cultural differences<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTURY COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Century Council is an organization involved in advertising campaigns<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NINTENDO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nintendo is a video game company that launched the Wii, a new video game console<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEO BURNETT USA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Leo Burnett USA is an advertising agency involved in the \"Wii Would Like to Play\" campaign for Nintendo<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLIN HARRIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Golin Harris is an agency involved in the \"Wii Would Like to Play\" campaign for Nintendo<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STARCOM WORLDWIDE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Starcom Worldwide is an agency involved in the \"Wii Would Like to Play\" campaign for Nintendo<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WII WOULD LIKE TO PLAY<|>EVENT<|>The \"Wii Would Like to Play\" campaign was a marketing effort by Nintendo to promote the Wii console<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NINTENDO<|>LEO BURNETT USA<|>Leo Burnett USA was involved in the marketing campaign for Nintendo's Wii<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NINTENDO<|>GOLIN HARRIS<|>Golin Harris was involved in the marketing campaign for Nintendo's Wii<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NINTENDO<|>STARCOM WORLDWIDE<|>Starcom Worldwide was involved in the marketing campaign for Nintendo's Wii<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NINTENDO<|>WII WOULD LIKE TO PLAY<|>Nintendo launched the \"Wii Would Like to Play\" campaign to promote the Wii console<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
