While attention getting, these can also be irritating. Professor\nMallia, who wrote the Part III opener, reminds us that online ads can succeed or fail because of\ntheir design, as well as their copy. She explains, “Visual tactics like rollovers and motion often\nannoy more than attract.” She also points out that copy is important in Web design, “Experts find\nit’s the copy that often gets the clickthrough—because it offers something the reader wants to read\nmore about.” So even in the highly visual online world, it’s still important for the art and copy to\nwork together to attract attention and build interest.\nAfascinating website was created for a get-out-the-vote site aimed at young people during\nthe 2008 election. Check out this website at www.thingsarefine.organd watch how the American\nflag falls apart on the opening page followed by the cynical admonition: “Don’t vote. Things are\nfine just the way they are.” The site also has great posters that\nviewers can download for free, companion public service\ncommercials, and links to sites that a committed viewer\ncould use to remind friends to vote and invite them to visit\nthe site.\nUsually the illustrations are created by artists but some-\ntimes for low-budget projects, the illustrations and photos are\nobtained from clip-art services, or rather click art, such as that\nprovided by www.dreamstime.com or www.1StopPictures\n.com. Actually, any image can be scanned and manipulated to\ncreate a Web image, which is causing copyright problems for\nartists and others who originally created the images, as ex-\nplained with the Obama HOPE story earlier in the chapter.
