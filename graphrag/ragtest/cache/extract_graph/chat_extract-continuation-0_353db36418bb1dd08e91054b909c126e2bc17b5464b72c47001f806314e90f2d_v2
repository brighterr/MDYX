The Internet has created large numbers of virtual commu-\nnitieswhere customers and prospects hang out and discuss brand problems, solutions, and new\nuses among themselves. Such websites, such as the one featured here for the Smart Car, create\nopportunities for real-time research into consumer insights and feelings. Many of these sites are\nnot run by companies, but rather by fans, who feel free to express themselves openly. There are\nalso company-sponsored sites that are often controlled and sometimes have rules that limit what\ncan be discussed. The sites that are the most successful are the ones that encourage interaction\nand networking.10\nAnew category of websites that focus on social networkingallows users to express them-\nselves, interact with friends, and publish their own content on the Internet. Facebook, MySpace,\nand Twitter, which you probably know well, are sites that allow users to share personal informa-\ntion with friends. Like the old mall and arcade hangouts, these are places where teens spend hours\ntalking to friends about their joys, crushes, and disappointments.\nHairong Li, a Michigan State professor and contributor to this book, explains that certain\ncharacteristics of social media—personal content, user engagement, social relationships, and\ngroup dynamics—differentiate social media from conventional mass media. The social engage-\nment helps individuals, particularly young people, develop a sense of self. Li explains that “shar-\ning experience with others is integral to how we construct a coherent yet often fragmented sense\nof self in a networked society.”\nThe reason these social networking sites are so attractive to marketers is that they engage the\npower of friendship-based influence. Because of these relationships, network members are more\n398 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nThe official social\nnetworking site of\nsmart USA is “smart\nUSA Insider.” The site\nenables owners and\nenthusiasts of the\nsmart car in the United\nStates to interact and\nstay connected with\nthe smart brand and\neach other.

Professor Li points out that “you may\nhave already seen some movie trailers and album posters on the pages of your friends. These trail-\ners and posters actually represent one of the newest forms of advertising—user-generated ads.\nBy user-generated ads, we mean the content of commercial nature that is created or posted on the\npages of users in social media that promotes a product, service, or cause.”\nThe Word-of-Mouth Role In addition to providing information and associating themselves with\nentertainment and social networking, advertisers are turning to the Internet because it opens up\nthe possibility of two-way communication, as in conversations. This characteristic supports two\nbasic objectives that drive advertisers’use of the Internet: (1) it creates a dialogue\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY.COM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heavy.com is a website that appeals to young men with a mix of racy, humorous video programming and wisecrack commercials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUTUBE.COM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>YouTube.com is a major site for consumer-generated film and video clips, including teenage video diaries, ad parodies, and TV show ideas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAMCOGAMES.COM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Namco Games is the website where you can play the classic game Pac-Man)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARLEY-DAVIDSON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Harley-Davidson is a brand with a fan club called Harley Owners Group (HOG))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMART USA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Smart USA is a brand with an official social networking site called Smart USA Insider for owners and enthusiasts to interact and stay connected)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACEBOOK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Facebook is a social networking site that allows users to share personal information with friends)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYSPACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MySpace is a social networking site that allows users to share personal information with friends)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TWITTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Twitter is a social networking site that allows users to share personal information with friends)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAIRONG LI<|>PERSON<|>Hairong Li is a Michigan State professor and contributor to the book, explaining characteristics of social media)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEAVY.COM<|>YOUTUBE.COM<|>Both Heavy.com and YouTube.com are websites that provide video content appealing to young audiences<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARLEY-DAVIDSON<|>SMART USA<|>Both Harley-Davidson and Smart USA have brand communities and social networking sites for enthusiasts<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACEBOOK<|>MYSPACE<|>Both Facebook and MySpace are social networking sites that allow users to share personal information<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACEBOOK<|>TWITTER<|>Both Facebook and Twitter are social networking sites that allow users to share personal information<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYSPACE<|>TWITTER<|>Both MySpace and Twitter are social networking sites that allow users to share personal information<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAIRONG LI<|>FACEBOOK<|>Hairong Li discusses the characteristics of social media, including Facebook, in his contributions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAIRONG LI<|>MYSPACE<|>Hairong Li discusses the characteristics of social media, including MySpace, in his contributions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAIRONG LI<|>TWITTER<|>Hairong Li discusses the characteristics of social media, including Twitter, in his contributions<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
