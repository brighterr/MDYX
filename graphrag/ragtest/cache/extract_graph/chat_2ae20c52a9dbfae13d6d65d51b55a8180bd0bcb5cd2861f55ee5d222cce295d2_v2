Finding the brilliant creative concept entails\nwhat advertising giant Otto Kleppner called the creative leap24—a process of jumping from the\nrather boring business language in a strategy statement to an original idea. This Big Idea trans-\nforms the strategy into something unexpected, original, and interesting. Since the creative leap\nmeans moving from the safety of a predictable strategy statement to an unusual idea that hasn’t\nbeen tried before, this leap is the creative risk.\nAclassic example of out-of-the-box thinking is Michelin’s tire advertising, which is driven\nby the strategic idea that the tire is durable and dependable—language that would make a pretty\nboring ad. The creative idea, however, comes to life in the long-running campaign that shows a\nbaby sitting in a tire. The visual is reinforced by the slogan, “Because so much is riding on your\n248 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\ntires.” The creative concept “leaps” from the idea of a durable tire\nto the idea of protecting your family, particularly precious members\nlike tiny children, by surrounding them with the dependability of a\nMichelin tire.\nAll creative ideas in advertising involve this element of risk.\nAlex Bogusky, chief creative officer at Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky,\none of the country’s hottest creative agencies, says he welcomes\nover-the-top work (think the Subservient Chicken and the Burger\nKing king) because it gets talked about. “I don’t mind spectacular\nfailure or spectacular criticism,” he says, because those ideas make\nheadlines, which means everybody’s talking about them. “There’s\nso much advertising that nobody knows even exists,” he adds.\n“That’s the stuff that I worry about making.”25\nDialing Up Your Creativity\nHow creative are you? You probably know people who are just\nnaturally zany, who come up with crazy, off-the-wall ideas. As\nSasser reminds us, “everyone has some level of internal creativ-\nity.” Creative advertising people may be weird and unconven-\ntional, however they can’t be totally eccentric. They still must be\npurpose driven, meaning they are focused on creating effective ad-\nvertising that’s on strategy.\nComing up with a great idea that is also on strategy is an emo-\ntional high. Advertising creatives describe it as one of the biggest\nemotional roller coasters in the business world. One copywriter\nexplained that when the ideas aren’t flowing, you feel like fleeing\nthe country. But when it’s a good idea, there’s nothing better.\nMichelin’s dependability and durability surround and\nIt’s a real high.

They don’t care much about group standards and opinions and typically have inborn\nskepticism and strong curiosity. Here are a few of the key characteristics of creative people who\ndo well in advertising:\n• Problem SolvingCreative problem solvers are alert, watchful, and observant and reach con-\nclusions through intuition rather than through logic.\n• PlayfulCreative people have fun with ideas; they have a mental playfulness that allows\nthem to make novel associations.\n• The Ability to VisualizeMost of the information we accumulate comes through sight, so the\nability to manipulate visual images is crucial for good copywriters as well as designers.\nThey can see products, people, and scenes in the mind’s eye, and they can visualize a mental\npicture of the finished ad while it is still in the talking, or idea, stage.\n• Open to New ExperiencesAs we said earlier, one characteristic that identifies creative peo-\nple is that they are open to new experiences. Over the course of a lifetime, openness to expe-\nrience may give you many more adventures from which to draw. Those experiences would,\nin turn, give a novelist more characters to write about, a painter more scenes to paint, and\nthe creative team more angles from which to tackle an advertising problem.26\n• Conceptual ThinkingIt’s easy to see how people who are open to experience might develop\ninnovative advertisements and commercials because they are more imaginative.27Such\nimagination led to a famous Nike commercial in which Michael Jordan and Larry Bird play\nan outlandish game of horse—bouncing the ball off buildings, billboards, and places that are\nimpossible to reach.\nCHAPTER 8 • THE CREATIVE SIDE 249\nPRACTICAL TIPS\nExercise Your Creative Muscles\nLinda Conway Correll,Assistant Professor, Southern Illinois University\nDeveloped by Linda Conway Correll, stance, Florida sunshine and oranges both suggest\nCreative Aerobics is a four-step, warmth, freshness, sunshine, the fountain of youth.)\nidea-generating process that is 4.
