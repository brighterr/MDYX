If you ask people what they think about Coke, you’ll learn that it is a “high-energy,\nthirst-quenching, fun-at-the-beach” kind of drink. But that may not be an adequate description of\nhow people really feel about the soft drink.24\nHereisacollectionofsomeofthemoreimaginativewaysqualitativeresearchersuseprojec-\ntivetechniquesasgamestogatherinsightsaboutpeople’srelationshipswiththebrandstheybuy:\n• Word associationis a projective technique that asks people to respond with thoughts or\nother words that come to mind when they are given a stimulus word. The idea is to uncover\nthe networks of connections in their thought patterns. These are used to test brand personali-\nties, as well as other types of meanings that govern consumer behavior.\n• Fill in the blanksis a form of attitude research in which people literally fill in the blanks in\na story or balloons in a cartoon. Perceptions can come to the surface in the words partici-\npants use to describe the action or situations depicted in the visuals.\n• Sentence completiontests give respondents the beginning of a sentence and ask them to fin-\nish it. These are good at eliciting descriptions, causes, results, as well as the meanings in per-\nsonal experiences.\n• Purpose-driven gamesallow researchers to see how people solve problems and search for in-\nformation.25Games can make the research experience more fun and involving for participants.\nThey also uncover problem-solving strategies that may mirror the participants’approach to in-\nformation searching or the kinds of problems they deal with in certain product situations.\n• Theater techniquesuse games in a theater setting where researchers have people experience\na variety of exercises to understand how they think about their brand. Some of these games\nhave people tell stories about products or simulations where they have to convince others to\nuse a brand.\n• Sculpting and movement techniques,such as positioning the body as a statue, can be a\nsource of insight in brainstorming for creative ideas and new product ideas. Sculpting in-\nvolves physically putting product users in static positions that reflect how they think about\nor use a brand. Physical movements, such as dance movements and martial arts, can be\nadded to increase the range of insight.\n• Story elicitationasks consumers to explain the artifacts of their lives, such as the photos dis-\nplayed in their homes and the objects they treasure. These stories can provide insights into\nhow and why people use or do things.\n• Artifact creationis a technique that uses such ideas as life collages, day mapping (tracking\nsomeone’s activities across a day), and the construction of instruction books as ways to elicit\nstories that discuss brands and their role in daily life. These projects are also useful later in\nexplaining to others—clients, the creative team, or other agencies—the triggers behind con-\nsumer insights.26\n• Photoelicitationissimilartoartifactresearchexceptitusesvisualstoelicitconsumer\nthoughtsandopinions.Aformofphoto-basedinterviewing,consumersareaskedtolookat\nasetofvisualsorinstructedtovisuallyrecordsomethingwithacamera,suchasashop-\npingtrip.Laterinreviewingthevisuals,theyareaskedtoexplainwhattheywerethinking\nordoing.\nCHAPTER 6 • STRATEGIC RESEARCH 183\n• Photo sorts,which is yet another visual technique, asks con-\nsumers to sort through a deck of photos and pick out visuals\nthat represent something to them, such as typical users of\nthe product or situations where it might be used. In identify-\ning typical users, they may be asked to sort the photos into\nspecific piles, such as happy, sad, angry, excited, or innova-\ntive people.\n• Metaphorsis a tool used by researchers to enrich the language\nconsumers use to talk about brands. (Remember your gram-\nmar: Ametaphorcompares one thing to another without using\nthe actual words likeoras.) The Evian ad, for example, uses a\nstrong metaphor to define its product. The insight into how\npeople perceive brands through such connections comes from\nexploring the link between the two concepts. Metaphor games\nare used in creativity to elicit new and novel ideas, but they can\nalso be used to analyze cognitive patterns in people’s thinking.\nThese methods can be combined. Harvard professor Zalt-\nman is the creator of ZMET(pronounced ZEE-MET), the Zalt-\nman Metaphor Elicitation Technique, which uses metaphors and\nvisual images to uncover patterns in people’s thinking. For a typ-\nical session, the respondents bring images that they think relate\nto the product category or brand being studied. Then they make\nup stories that describe their feelings about the product or\nbrand.27The Cheetos research team used the ZMETand uncov-\nered the unexpected finding about stress and how Cheetos was an escape from those pressures.\nThis metaphoric ad\nForCoca-ColainEurope,Zaltmanaskedvolunteerstocollectatleastadozenpicturesthat equating Evian\ncapturedtheirfeelingsaboutCoca-Cola.Thentheydiscussedtheimagesinpersonalinterviews. sparkling water with a\nFinally,thevolunteerscreatedasummaryimage—adigitalcollageoftheirmostimportantim- mermaid tries to add a\nagesandrecordedastatementthatexplaineditsmeaning.TheZMETteamfoundthatCokeis touch of originality, as\nnotjustaboutfeelingsofhighenergyandgoodtimes;italsohasanelementofcalm,solitude, well as meaning, to the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COCA-COLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Coca-Cola is a globally recognized beverage brand known for its high-energy, thirst-quenching drinks, often associated with fun and relaxation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZMET<|>EVENT<|>The Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique is a research method that uses metaphors and visual images to uncover patterns in people's thinking about brands)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZALTMAN<|>PERSON<|>Harvard professor and creator of the Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique, which explores cognitive patterns through metaphors and images)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEETOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cheetos is a snack brand that was found to be associated with stress relief and escape from pressures through ZMET research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVIAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Evian is a brand of sparkling water that uses strong metaphors in advertising to convey originality and meaning)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZALTMAN<|>ZMET<|>Zaltman is the creator of the ZMET, a technique used to explore consumer perceptions through metaphors<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COCA-COLA<|>ZMET<|>Coca-Cola was studied using the ZMET to uncover deeper consumer feelings beyond high energy and good times<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHEETOS<|>ZMET<|>The ZMET was used to discover that Cheetos is perceived as an escape from stress<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EVIAN<|>ZMET<|>Evian uses metaphorical advertising, a concept explored in ZMET research, to add originality and meaning<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
