This then allows the media group to work for\nclients who may be competitors to some of those handled by the agency. Because these compa-\nnies control the money, they have become a powerful force in the advertising industry, leading to\na tug of war over control of planning. Faced with competition from these independent media com-\npanies, many large agencies have set up or bought their own buying services to compete with the\nindependents and go after outside business.\nSome of these media companies are now offering consolidated services, which means\nbringing the planning and buying functions back together. To take advantage of this consolida-\ntion argument, some media companies are also adding special planning teams for other related ar-\neas such as events, product placement, Internet, and guerilla marketing programs. WPP’s\nMindShare created an agency-within-the-agency called the Wow Factory to develop ideas for\nnontraditional media.20For a major presentation to Coca-Cola, Starcom MediaVest pulled a team\ntogether that represented basic media planning and buying, research, consumer insights, pro-\ngramming, product placement, entertainment marketing, and integration solutions.21At this point,\nthese big media companies begin to look more like traditional agencies.\nOnline Media Buying A bigger threat to agencies than media-buying services comes from\nGoogle and Yahoo!, which, although not ad agencies, are making inroads into media buying and\nselling. Google is using its website to sell ads primarily to small advertisers and publishers who\nfind its automated advertising network, Google Adworks, to be a cost-effective way to connect\nwith one another. Agencies are trying to figure out if Google and Yahoo! are friends or enemies\nand what their move into online media buying will do to the revenue stream. Google, however, is\nbetting that its expertise in search advertising, which matches ads to user interests, will give it an\nadvantage over traditional ad media services.\nNew Forms of Media Research As we mentioned earlier, one challenge media planners face is\nthe lack of reliable audience research and measurement metrics for the new media. The traditional\n“measured” media with their CPMs were at least somewhat predictable in level of impact. But\nthe metrics for online media—hits and clicks—don’t really tell us much about impact. Compar-\ning TRPs and clicks is like comparing apples and oranges.\nWe also know that exposure does not equal attention, which is a huge problem for evaluat-\ning the impact of television. In other words, just because the television is on does not mean any-\none is watching; and just because a program is on does not mean anyone is watching the ads.\nSearch advertising on the Internet is also complicating things because, if it’s successful, it\nsteals viewers away from the original site. Does ESPN benefit when viewers leave its site to click\non the banner ad for StubHub Ticket Center? As one critic observed, search advertising may make\nsense as a form of direct marketing, but it is a nightmare for content publishers who sell adver-\ntising on their pages. In such a situation, how do you evaluate efficiency of the publisher’s site?\nOf the search advertising? If one is a winner, doesn’t that automatically mean the other is a loser?\nViral marketing is equally difficult to measure, although YouTube is developing analytic\ndata to help media planners assess the impact of the video-sharing site. Other companies such as\nVisible Measures, Unruly Media, and Millward Brown’s Link provide viral monitoring services\nthat assess the impact not only of YouTube, but also of multiple online platforms. As such ser-\nvices mature, marketers will become smarter about selecting marketing communication messages\nwith the most viral video potential.22\nAnother problem is that media research is based on each medium as a silo—separate stud-\nies for separate media. Most of the research services are unable to tell you much about the effec-\ntiveness of combined media; the impact such as seeing the same message on television and then\nreading about it in a newspaper story or ad is difficult to evaluate.\n452 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nLooking Ahead\nThat point leads to the next part of the book in which we review specific areas of marketing com-\nmunication, such as public relations, direct response, sales promotion, and sponsorships—all of\nwhich are important aspects of multiplatform IMC programs. Then we’ll apply this wider world\nof IMC to specific situations, such as retail, business-to-business, nonprofit, and international\nmarketing. We’ll end Part 5 with a discussion of evaluation and wrap up the effectiveness theme\nthat is so important in today’s brand communication.\nIT’S A WRAP\nBeauty of a Campaign\nThis chapter identified media strategies that are relevant to advertisers as they decide how to reach their\naudience effectively. The point is that the key to effective customer-focused advertising is staying sensi-\ntive to consumers and understanding how they think, act, and feel—and where they’ll be able connect with\nthe brand message.\nThe provocative copy in the Dove “Campaign for Real Beauty” challenges the audience to reconsider\nhow they define beauty and to love their bodies, no matter what their age or shape. The campaign gener-\nated a huge buzz. But did it work to sell the product?\nAccording to Unilever, the campaign resulted in a 24 percent sales increase during the advertising period\nacross the entire Dove brand.\nThe brand also fared well globally. When it was launched in the United Kingdom, sales of Dove Firming\nLotion reportedly increased by 700 percent in the first seven months after the posters appeared. It generated\na substantial press\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WPP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WPP is a multinational advertising and public relations company that owns MindShare, which created the Wow Factory for nontraditional media ideas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINDSHARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MindShare is a media agency under WPP that created the Wow Factory to develop nontraditional media ideas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOW FACTORY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Wow Factory is an agency-within-the-agency created by MindShare to develop ideas for nontraditional media)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COCA-COLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Coca-Cola is a major client for which Starcom MediaVest pulled together a comprehensive media planning and buying team)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STARCOM MEDIAVEST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Starcom MediaVest is a media company that assembled a team for Coca-Cola, covering various aspects of media planning and buying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google is a technology company making inroads into media buying and selling through its automated advertising network, Google Adworks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YAHOO!<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yahoo! is a technology company exploring online media buying, posing a threat to traditional ad agencies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE ADWORKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google Adworks is an automated advertising network by Google, connecting small advertisers and publishers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUTUBE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>YouTube is a video-sharing platform developing analytic data to help media planners assess the impact of viral marketing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VISIBLE MEASURES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Visible Measures is a company providing viral monitoring services to assess the impact of online platforms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNRULY MEDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unruly Media is a company offering viral monitoring services for online platforms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILLWARD BROWN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Millward Brown is a market research company providing viral monitoring services through its Link service)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dove is a personal care brand under Unilever, known for its \"Campaign for Real Beauty\" which increased sales significantly)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNILEVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unilever is a multinational consumer goods company that owns the Dove brand and reported a sales increase due to the \"Campaign for Real Beauty\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WPP<|>MINDSHARE<|>MindShare is a media agency owned by WPP<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MINDSHARE<|>WOW FACTORY<|>MindShare created the Wow Factory to develop nontraditional media ideas<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STARCOM MEDIAVEST<|>COCA-COLA<|>Starcom MediaVest assembled a comprehensive media planning and buying team for Coca-Cola<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE<|>GOOGLE ADWORKS<|>Google Adworks is an automated advertising network by Google<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE<|>YAHOO!<|>Google and Yahoo! are both exploring online media buying, posing a threat to traditional ad agencies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUTUBE<|>VISIBLE MEASURES<|>Visible Measures provides viral monitoring services that include YouTube<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUTUBE<|>UNRULY MEDIA<|>Unruly Media offers viral monitoring services that include YouTube<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUTUBE<|>MILLWARD BROWN<|>Millward Brown's Link service provides viral monitoring services that include YouTube<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOVE<|>UNILEVER<|>Dove is a personal care brand owned by Unilever<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
