How, then, are these colors reproduced?\nFull-color images are reproduced using four distinctive shades of ink called process colors,\nin order to produce four-color printing.These colors are magenta (a shade of pinkish purple),\ncyan(a shade of bright blue), yellow, and black. Printing inks are transparent, so when one ink\noverlaps another, a third color is created and that’s how the full range of colors is created. For ex-\nample, red and blue create purple, yellow and blue create green, yellow and red create orange.\nThe black is used for type and, in four-color printing, adds depth to the shadows and dark tones\nin an image. The process printers use to reduce the original color image to four halftone negatives\nis called color separation.Figure 10.5illustrates the process of color separation.\nDigitization If an ad is going to run in a number of publications, there has to be some way to\ndistribute a reproducible, duplicate of the ad to all of them. The duplicate material for offset\nprintingis a slick proof of the original mechanical. More recently, digitizationof images has\nbeen used to distribute reproducible images. This is also how computers now handle the color\nreproduction process. These digitized images can be transmitted electronically to printers across\na city for local editions of national newspapers, or by satellite for regional editions of magazines\nand newspapers such as USA Today. Agencies also use this method for transmitting ad proofs\nwithin the agency network and to clients.\nDigitization makes it possible to create some spectacular effects in out-of-home advertising.\nSome outdoor boards have become digital screens complete with changing and moving images.\nAnew technique in transit advertising comes from Atlanta where the city’s buses are wrapping\ntheir sides with something called “glow skin.” The ads use electroluminescent lighting to make\nthe ads glow at night and appear to jump off the sides of the buses.7\nBinding and Finishing\nArt directors can enhance their ads and other printed materials by using a number of special print-\ning effects. For example, USRobotics, a maker of minicomputers, once used a small brochure the\nactual size of a Palm Pilot to demonstrate its minicomputer’s size. The shot of the Palm Pilot was\nglued to a photo of a hand. As the ad unfolded, it became a complete product brochure that visu-\nally demonstrated the actual size of the minicomputer.\nOther mechanical techniques include:\n• Die CuttingAsharp-edged stamp, or die, is used to cut out unusual shapes. Acommon die-\ncutshape you’re familiar with is the tab on a file folder.\n308 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\n(A) (B) (C)\n(D) (E) (F)\nFIGURE 10.5\nThe Color Separation Process\nThese six photos illustrate the process of creating four-color separations: (A) Yellow plate. (B) Magenta plate.\n(C) Yellow and magenta combined plate. (D) Cyan plate. (Note:After cyan is added, there would also be combined\nplates showing cyan added first to yellow, then to magenta, then to the combined yellow and magenta plates. These\nsteps were left out to simplify the presentation.) (E) Black plate. (F) Finished art with all four process colors combined.\n• Embossing or DebossingThe application of pressure to create a raised surface (embossing)\nor depressed image (debossing) in paper.\n• Foil StampingThe process of foil stampinginvolves molding a thin metallic coating (sil-\nver, gold) to the surface of an image.\n• Tip-InsAtip-inis a separate, preprinted ad provided by the advertiser that is glued into a\npublication as the publication is being assembled or bound. Perfume manufacturers, for ex-\nample, tip in samples that are either scratch-and-sniff or scented strips that release a fra-\ngrance when pulled apart.\nAnother example of a nifty production trick is illustrated in the ad for Specialized Bikes us-\ning a “see-through” technique. The graphic elements are separated and printed on the front and\nCHAPTER 10 • VISUAL COMMUNICATION 309\nSHOWCASE\nContributed by Aaron Stern, who worked on this ad for Specialized Bikes when he was at Goodby, Silverstein and\nPartners in San Francisco, the ad shows a creative use of the “see-through” capability of print.\nA graduate of the University of Colorado, Stern is now in New York finishing an MFA in creative writing\nat New York University. He was nominated by Professor Brett Robbs.\nback of a page. When you look at the ad you see people in the foreground going about their business\nbut in the background a faint image shows a daredevil bike rider jumping from one building to\nanother or riding on a handrail going down the middle of a set of steps.\nWHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW\nABOUT VIDEO PRODUCTION?\nWhere does an art director start when putting together a video for a commercial, a video news re-\nlease, or some other kind of corporate film or video? Lara Mann gives you a look inside the pro-\nduction of a television commercial in the A Day in the Lifefeature.\nObviouslythefirstconsiderationisthenatureoftheimage.Theartdirectorcanarrangefor\nfilming on a constructed set or in a real location or choose to use stock footage—previously\nrecordedimages,eithervideo,stillslides,ormovingfilm.Typicalstockfootage\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
