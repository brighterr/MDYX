This characteristic supports two\nbasic objectives that drive advertisers’use of the Internet: (1) it creates a dialogue with customers\nand (2) it stimulates a conversation among and between customers and potential customers.\nThe first objective relates to the interactivity dimension of the Internet. Remember from\nPrinciple\nChapter 4that two-way communication is the most persuasive type of communication available\nThe more interactive a\nmedium and the closer it to marketers. With interactive media, it is possible for a consumer to contact the company and get\nis to a dialogue, the more a personal answer. The point is that the closer the medium is to a dialogue or the more a user can\npersonal and persuasive generate or manipulate the content, the more the marketing communication moves away from tra-\nthe communication ditional advertiser-controlled one-way advertising.\nexperience. The second objective relates to the power of word-of-mouth communication. Advertising\nplanners have developed a growing respect for media that generate buzz or word of mouth. The\nidea is to get people talking about a brand because we have recognized that the most important\nfactor in consumer decision making is often the opinions of others, such as family and friends.\nAn annual study of media use by the BIGresearch firm, which polled 15,000 consumers, found\nCHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 399\nthat the most influential form of media is word of mouth (WoM). The finding was supported by\nother research that has found WoM to be the most important influence on consumer decision\nmaking—considerably more important than traditional media.11\nTy Montague, former chief creative officer at JWT, points to his agency’s work for JetBlue\nas a brand built almost entirely on word of mouth. He explains that the airline’s advertising “is\ndesigned to provide as many ways as possible for fans of the brand to spread the word themselves,\nfrom stuff like a high-tech booth where they can literally create their own testimonials, which get\nrun on TV, to things as simple and high touch as prepaid postcards in seat back pockets that they\ncan use to share their experiences.”12\nJapanese marketing communication giant, Dentsu, expresses this idea in its B2C2C concept.\nPrinciple\nArevitalization of the traditional business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing approach, the Dentsu\nA B2C2C strategy is\nB2C2C strategy proposes that a marcom message emanates from a business then moves to key designed to move a\ncustomers and influencers who then talk about it with other consumers in the target market. Be- message from a business\ncause this is an interactive environment, messages can then move back again from consumers to to key customers who\nkey customers who are in touch with the business. The important new dimension in this model is then talk about it with\nthe C2C dimension, which recognizes that people today get much of their information from their other consumers—and\nfriends, whether in person or online. Rather than top down, at this level brand messages are flow- messages use the same\nroute to come back to the\ning side to side, creating a network of shared brand experiences. Although C2C is made easier by\nbusiness.\nall of the new digital media, experts point out that digital marketers can learn a lot from offline\nword-of-mouth campaigns. The vice president of social media at the Razorfish agency, for ex-\nample, looks offline to better understand “how the relationship between marketer and influencer\nis developed and how their influence is measured.”13\nTYPES OF ONLINE MARKETING COMMUNICATION\nWhat kinds of Internet communication are available today to marketers? The industry is moving\nso quickly that by the time you read this passage, other categories may replace or supplement\nthose we discuss here. Essentially, Internet advertising can be delivered as a traditional ad, just\nlike those you see in a magazine, or it can be presented in a number of other formats such as banner\nads, e-mail, brand blogs, and social sites, among other forms.\nWebsites\nYou’re probably familiar with these terms, but let’s review how the Internet is shaping up for\nmarketers. Sometimes called a home page,a company’s websiteis the online face it presents\nto the public. The website is a communication tool that blurs the distinction between market-\ning communication forms, such as advertising, direct marketing, and public relations. In some\ncases it looks like an online corporate brochure, or it may function as an online catalog. The\nwebsite can also be an information resource with a searchable library of stories and data about\nproducts, product categories, and related topics. It may even deliver sales. In all cases, how-\never, a critical function of a website is to create a brand or organizational identity and reinforce\nthe brand position.\nTheGuitar Hero:Smash Hitswebsite, which we introduced in Chapter 11, is a good exam-\nple. You heard earlier from Diego Contreras, interactive art director at Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky,\non how he approaches design for online media. We also used some of his Guitar Hero:Smash Hits\nbanners in Chapter 11. Let’s continue that discussion with comments from him on how he devel-\noped the Smash Hitswebsite. He explained that Activision had a very small budget for this cam-\npaign so they decided to focus their spending online.
