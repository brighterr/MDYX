Or e-mail\nspam? Or phone calls by telemarketers? Can these tools possibly be effective?\nAs you know from your own observations and from reading the previous chapters, most\nPrinciple\nmarketing communication messages have been carried by mass media as “one-way” messages\nMarketers use new media\nthat talk “at” customers and prospects. Although these messages are cost efficient (i.e., have a\nforms to talk directly with,\nlower cost per thousand CPM), they are not as effective as DMC messages that are more interac-\nrather than at, customers\ntive and have the potential to create higher levels of customer engagement.\nand other stakeholders,\ncreating higher levels of As the Internet and mobile communication devices have become more pervasive and so-\ncustomer engagement. phisticated, marketers are shifting more and more of their marcom budgets into direct-response\nCHAPTER 16 • DIRECT RESPONSE 489\nmarketing communication. Because this type of messaging is specifically designed to motivate\nan immediate response, it is sometimes also called direct-response marketing. And because DMC\nis designed to generate immediate responses, this means it is also easy to tell quickly if the mes-\nsages are meeting their objectives. In other words, unlike mass media advertising and public re-\nlations, the effects of DMC are more immediate and more measurable.\nThe Direct Marketing Association is the professional association for this category of mar-\nketing communication. We’ll define direct-response marketing as a multichannel system of\nmarketing that uses a variety of media to connect sellers and customers who deal with each other\ndirectly rather than through an intermediary, such as a wholesaler or retailer. There are two pieces\nto the direct marketing business: first, direct marketing relies on communication that is sent in\nsome form direct to the consumer and, second, the response (sales, sign-up, request for informa-\ntion) comes directly back to the source. In both cases there is no intermediary, such as a retailer.\nAs noted in Figure 16.1, direct marketing includes a strong focus on market research to guide\nstrategy and database development to better target customers and prospects and invite them to in-\nteract with a company. Using an interactive communication model, the contact is designed to\nelicit an immediate response, usually a sale, as well as invite customers to contact a company. It\nalso helps marcom planners listen to what their customers are saying as they respond.\nThemostimportantfunctionofdirectmarketingisthatitopensupthedoorforinteractivity—\nandwhyisthatimportant?InthePart5openerDuncansaidthatthebestpracticesofIMCen-\ngage stakeholders in meaningful and often interactive brand experiences.

Recently direct response has come to mean more than just advertising\nas it has expanded into new media that support entertainment platforms and social networks.\nWho Are the Key Players?\nThe four main players in direct-response marketing communication are (1) marketers who use di-\nrect response to sell products or services; (2) agencies that specialize in direct-response advertis-\ning; (3) phone, mail, or Internet media that deliver messages; and (4) consumers who are the\nrecipients of the information and sometimes initiators of the contact.\nMarketers Who do you suppose are the biggest users\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DIRECT MARKETING ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Direct Marketing Association is the professional association for direct-response marketing communication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNET<|>GEO<|>A pervasive and sophisticated platform used for direct-response marketing communication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES<|>GEO<|>Devices that have become more pervasive and sophisticated, used for direct-response marketing communication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN<|>PERSON<|>A person mentioned in the context of best practices of Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC))\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIRECT MARKETING ASSOCIATION<|>INTERNET<|>The Direct Marketing Association recognizes the Internet as a key platform for direct-response marketing<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIRECT MARKETING ASSOCIATION<|>MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES<|>The Direct Marketing Association recognizes mobile communication devices as key tools for direct-response marketing<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN<|>DIRECT MARKETING ASSOCIATION<|>Duncan is associated with the best practices of IMC, which includes direct-response marketing<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
