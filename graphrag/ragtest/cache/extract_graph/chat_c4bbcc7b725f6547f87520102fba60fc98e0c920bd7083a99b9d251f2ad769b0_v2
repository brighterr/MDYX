In other words, does the group of people who read\nthis magazine, watch this television program, or see these posters include a high proportion of the\nadvertiser’s ideal target audience? If so, then these media vehicles may be a good choice for the\ncampaign, depending on other strategic factors, such as timing and cost.\nMedia planners, for example, are unlikely to run ads for women’s products on the Super\nBowl, which is skewed 56 percent male; instead, they buy time on the Oscars, which has a much\nhigher percentage of female viewers. However, in 2010 Dove used the Super Bowl to launch its\nMen(cid:2)Care personal care products.1These are the kinds of decisions that make media planning\nboth fun and challenging.\nThe breadth of the target, as defined in the marketing communication plan, determines\nPrinciple\nwhether the media planner will be using a broad mass media approach or a tightly targeted and\nThe tighter the focus on\na target market, the easier highly focused approach.

As you can imagine, every media vehicle’s audience is different and therefore varies re-\ngarding what percentage of its audience is in the brand’s target audience. For example, Mercury\nMarine, which makes outboard boat motors, targets households (HHs) that own one or more\nboats. It prefers to advertise in magazines where it can feature beautiful illustrations of its prod-\nucts as well as room to explain the many benefits of its motors. Should it advertise in Time or\nBoatingmagazine?Timemagazine reaches 4 million HHs, of which 280,000 HHs have boats; in\n426\nCHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 427\ncomparison,Boatinghas only 200,000 HH subscribers. If you said Time,sorry, you’re not being\nvery cost efficient. This is because even though Timereaches 80,000 more boat-owning house-\nholds, it also reaches 3.7 million HHs that don’t own boats. Mercury would have to pay to reach\nall readers, even those not in its target audience. By advertising in Boating,it can pretty well as-\nsume that subscribers either own a boat or at least are interested in boating.\nIn addition to information compiled by the team’s media researchers, consumer insight re-\nsearch also is used to identify and analyze the target audience’s media use patterns. Industry re-\nsearch helps. For example, in a 2009 study, Harris Interactive Research found that 37 percent of\nAmericans said TVads are most helpful in making a purchase decision. Newspapers (19 percent)\ncame in second; only 14 percent said Internet search engines were most helpful. In fact, nearly\nhalf of the respondents said they ignored Internet banner ads.2\nThis type of research that asks consumers what they think influences their behavior is best\nused when combined with other consumer behavior findings. Why? Because most consumers\ndon’t really know what influences them. (Just ask some of your friends how much advertising im-\npacts what they buy. Most will probably say that “it doesn’t” or “just a little.”)\nFor the launch of the Audi\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
