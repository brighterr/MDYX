These are other techniques copywriters use to create catchy slogans:\n• Direct Address“Have it your way”; “Think small.”\n• A Startling or Unexpected PhraseTwists a common phrase to make it unexpected, as in the\nNYNEX campaign: “If it’s out there, it’s in here.”\n• Rhyme,Rhythm,AlliterationUses repetition of sounds, as in the Wall Street Journal’s slo-\ngan, “The daily diary of the American Dream.”\n• Parallel ConstructionUses repetition of the structure of a sentence or phrase, as in Morton\nSalt’s “When it rains, it pours.”\n• Cue the ProductFolgers’“Good to the last drop”; John Deere’s “Nothing runs like a\nDeere”; Wheaties’“Breakfast of Champions”; “Beef. It’s What’s for Dinner.”\n• Music“In the valley of the Jolly, ho-ho-ho, Green Giant.”\n• Combination“It’s your land, lend a hand,” which is the slogan for Take Pride in America.\n(Rhyme,rhythm,parallel)\nHow to Write Body Copy\nThe body copy is the text of the ad, and its primary role is to maintain the interest of the reader.\nIt develops the sales message, states the argument, summarizes the proof, and provides explana-\ntion. It is the persuasive heart of the message. You excite consumer interest with the display ele-\nments, but you win them over with the argument presented in the body copy, assuming the ad uses\nbody copy or an overt selling premise.\nConsider the way the copy is written for this classic ad that comes from the award-winning\nNike women’s campaign. Analyze the argument the copywriter is making and how the logic flows\nto a convincing conclusion.

Nike launched the Let Me Play Fund in support of this campaign after racist and sex-\nist comments about the Rutgers University women’s basketball team by radio shock jock Don\nImus. In response to his offensive comments, Nike ran a full-page ad in The New York Times\nthan opened with “Thank you, ignorance” followed by “Thank you for moving women’s sports\nforward.”\n272 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nA MATTER OF PRINCIPLE\nThe Principle of Truth\nJean Grow, Associate Professor, Marquette University\n“It wasn’t advertising.
