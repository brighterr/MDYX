Discovery Network (1993)The Court ruled that the Cincinnati City Council\nviolated the First Amendment’s protection of commercial speech when it banned news racks\nof advertising brochures from city streets for aesthetic and safety reasons, while permitting\nnewspaper vending machines.\n• Edenfield v. Fane (1993)The Court ruled that Florida’s prohibition of telephone solicitation\nby accountants was unconstitutional.\n• U.S. v. Edge Broadcasting (1993)Broadcasting gambling is a vice, so the legislature has the\ngreater power to ban it along with the lesser power to ban advertising of it.\n• 44 Liquormart,Inc. v. Rhode Island (1996)The Court ruled that two Rhode Island statutes\nthat banned advertising for alcohol prices were unconstitutional.\n• Glickman v. Wileman Bros. & Elliott,Inc. (1997)The Court ruled that a mandatory generic\nadvertising program, issued in accord with marketing orders of the Agricultural Marketing\nAct, did not infringe on the free speech rights of fruit growers.\n• New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964)The Court ruled that the First Amendment protects\ncriticism of the government that appeared in advertising even though it included some minor\nfactual errors.\n• Rubin v. Coors Brewing (1995)The Court reaffirmed the regulation of commercial speech\nwhen it ruled that Coors could publish the alcohol content on its label despite the Federal Al-\ncohol Administration Act prohibition of doing so.\n• Greater New Orleans Broadcasters Assn. v. U.S. (1999)The Court ruled that federal law\nprohibits some, but not all broadcast advertising of lotteries and casino gambling.\n• Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010)The Court ruled that government\nmay not ban political spending by corporations in candidate elections.\nInternational Laws and Regulations As advertisers, agencies, and media become more global, it\nwill be imperative for the players to understand local laws in the countries in which they operate.

They’re advertising the companies’travel, clothing, and\nrestaurantbusinesses.\nThere also are differences in the legal use of various marketing communication tools. Acon-\ntest or promotion might be successful in one country and illegal in another. Different laws and self-\nregulatory codes about direct marketing exist in different European Union countries. For example,\nFrance requires an opt-in clause to a mailing or questionnaire asking permission to add the cus-\ntomer’s name to a mailing list.33Germany prohibits companies from making unsolicited telephone\ncalls and faxes to consumers. Because of the difficulty in complying with widely varying laws, in-\nternational advertisers often work with either local agencies or with international agencies that\nhave local affiliates and experts who know the local laws and can identify potential legal problems.\nMarketing Regulatory Environment\nIn addition to specific legislation that affects the practice of marketing communication, there are\nalso government bodies that oversee the application of these laws and establish standards and reg-\nulations that marketers must meet. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the primary body that\noversees marketing communication, but a number of other agencies are also involved in regulat-\ning the messages sent to consumers, as summarized in the following list:\nSpecialized Government Agencies That Affect Advertising\nAgency Effect on Advertising\nFederal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov) Regulates credit, labeling, packaging,\nwarranties, and advertising.\nFood and Drug Administration Regulates packaging, labeling, and\n(www.fda.gov) manufacturing of food and drug products.\nFederal Communications Commission Regulates radio and television stations and\n(www.fcc.gov) networks.\nU.S. Postal Service (www.usps.gov) Controls advertising by monitoring materials\nsent through the mail.\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division of the U.S. Treasury Department\n(www.atf.treas.gov) that regulates advertising for alcoholic\nbeverages.\nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office Oversees trademark registration to protect\n(www.uspto.gov) against patent infringement.\nLibrary of Congress (www.loc.gov) Provides controls for copyright protection.\nIn addition to the FTC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Commu-\nnications Commission (FCC) are dynamic components of the regulatory environment. Let’s\nlook in more depth at their missions and the type of practices they regulate.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) Established by Congress in 1914 to oversee business, the\nFTC is the primary agency governing the advertising industry.
