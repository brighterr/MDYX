This person takes the art director’s story-\nboard and makes it come to life on film.\nThe producer and director make up the core of the production team. The commercial’s ef-\nfectiveness depends on their shared vision of the final commercial and the director’s ability to\nbring it to life as the art director imagined it. In the case of the “Cat Herders” commercial, the di-\nrector was chosen by the agency because of his skill at coaxing naturally humorous performances\n310\nCHAPTER 10 • VISUAL COMMUNICATION 311\nfrom nonprofessional actors. In this commercial he worked with real wranglers on their semi-\nscripted testimonials about their work with kitties.\nThe following list summarizes the responsibilities of broadcast production personnel:\nWho Does What in Broadcast Production?\nCopywriter Writes the script, whether it contains dialogue, narrative, lyrics,\nannouncements, descriptions, or no words at all.\nArt Director In TV, develops the storyboard and establishes the look of the\ncommercial, whether realistic, stylized, or fanciful.\nProducer(can be Takes charge of the production, handles the bidding and all production\nan agency staff arrangements, finds the specialists, arranges for casting talent, and makes\nmember) sure the expenses and bids come in under budget.\nDirector Has responsibility for the actual filming or taping, including how long\nthe scene runs, who does what, how lines are spoken, and how characters\nare played; in TVdetermines how the camera is set up and records the\nflow of action.\nComposer Writes original music and sometimes the lyrics as well.\nArranger Orchestrates music for the various instruments and voices to make it fit a\nscene or copy line. The copywriter usually writes the lyrics or at least\ngives the arranger some idea of what the words should convey.\nEditor Puts everything together toward the end of the filming or taping process;\nevaluates how to assemble scenes and which audio elements work best\nwith the dialogue and footage.\nThe Process of Producing Videos\nAs we said earlier there are a number of ways to produce a message for a video, such as a televi-\nsion commercial. Let’s look at these production choices.\nTypically the film is shot on 35-mm film or videotape and then digitized, after which the editor\ntransfers the image to videotape for dissemination, a process called film-to-tape transfer. Digital\ntechnology is changing the process. Eventually\nfilms will transfer to hard drives, eliminating the\nuse of videotape. Art directors work closely with\neditors who assemble the shots and cut the film\nto create the right pacing and sequence of images\nas outlined in the storyboard.\nObviously the Big Idea for the “Cat\nHerders” ad created some real production chal-\nlenges. In the spot, the Fallon art director de-\ncided that the metaphor of herding cats meant\nthat the cats had to swim across a river, but was\nthat even possible? Here’s how it was done:\nThe trainers taught a few cats that weren’t ad-\nverse to water to swim by starting them out in\none-quarter inch of water in a child’s swim-\nming pool and then gradually adding water to\nthe pool until it was deep enough for the cats to\nswim.

Cartoon figures, for exam-\nple, were sketched and then resketched for the next frame with a slight change to\nindicate a small progression in the movement of an arm or leg a facial expression.\nAnimation is traditionally shot at 16 drawings per second. Low-budget animation\nuses fewer drawings, so the motion looks jerky. The introduction of computers has\naccelerated the process and eliminated a lot of the tedious hand work.\nAnimationissimilartoillustrationinprintinthatitabstractsimagesandadds\natouchoffantasyand/ormoodtotheimage.AsKarlSchroeder,acopywriterwith\nCoatesKokesinPortland,Oregon,explainsaboutaprojecthisteamworkedonfor\na recycling center: “What was nice about it, when you consider that the spots\nneededtoappealtoEVERYONEwhorecyclesinthearea,wasthatit[animation]\ngotusawayfromcastingraciallyambiguous,hard-to-pin-an-age-ontalent.”\nAnimation effects can also be used to combine animated characters, such as\nthe little green Geico Gecko, with live-action figures, or even with other animated\ncharacters. The famous Aflac duck was created as a collaboration between Warner\nBrothers and the Aflac agency, the Kaplan Thaler Group in New York.
