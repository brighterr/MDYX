The site ezinearticles.com only uses reader-generated content, which offers\neveryone the opportunity to write magazine-quality articles and publish them online. If not obvi-\nously commercial, the site is also an outlet for business-related articles. Many zines are aimed at\nniche markets. The Root, for example, is an online magazine that provides news and culture from\na black perspective. You can find it at www.theroot.com, and also check out the advertiser that\nsupports this site.\nOnline encyclopedias, such as Wikipedia, are another huge source of information. Wikipedia\npublishes contributions from anyone who wants to write and edit entries in a collaborative, open-\nsource system of information collection. The fifth most popular website in the world, it has approx-\nimately 325 million visitors a month and 3 million contributors who write and edit the content in\n10 languages. The site is so popular that it has spun off a number of other specialized sites that are\nadvertising supported, such as wikiHow, which is a how-to guide (how to cook a brisket, how to fix\na garage door opener) built on the same principles as Wikipedia. ShopWiki offers product reviews\nand Wikitravel provides tourism information. So even encyclopedias are now an advertising medium.\nThe Entertainment Role Many users go online for entertainment, such as poker and other\ngames, playing the stock market, and keeping up with fashion, music, and videos. Some of these\nCHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 397\nentertainment opportunities are fun, and some are personally\nchallenging, but they all engage their users either as escape\nor relaxation, and that also makes them a useful medium in\nwhich to advertise because the messages can be associated\nwith positive experiences.\nComputer games and video games are, of course, the\nepitome of digital entertainment. One of the first computer\ngames, Pac-Man, was developed in 1980 by Namco and re-\nleased for Atari in 1982. Adapted from its arcade game, the\nmovement of the little round yellow icon, which traveled\nthrough a maze gobbling up cookies, was controlled by a\njoystick. Four ghosts impeded his progress and when he en-\ncountered one directly he lost his “life” and was reanimated\nback at the center of the maze to start his quest all over again.\nYou might be interested to know that Pac-Man had a spin-off\nbreakfast cereal. Here’s another piece of advertising trivia, in\n1983 at age 8 Christian Bale (Dark Knight) acted in a Pac-\nMan cereal commercial.
