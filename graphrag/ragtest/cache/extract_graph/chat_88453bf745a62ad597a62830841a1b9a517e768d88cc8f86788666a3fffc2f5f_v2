Figure 10.6 shows the\nsteps in the process.\nPreproduction The producer and staff first develop a set of production notes,describing in de-\ntail every aspect of the production. These notes are important for finding talent and locations,\nbuilding sets, and getting bids and estimates from specialists. In the “Cat Herders” commercial,\nfinding the talent was critical. Some 50 felines and their trainers were involved in the filming.\nSurprisingly, different cats have different skills—some were able to appear to be asleep or mo-\ntionless on cue, while others excelled as runners or specialized in water scenes.\nOnce the bids for production have been approved, the creative team and the producer,\ndirector, and other key players hold a preproduction meeting to outline every step of the\nproduction process and anticipate every problem that may arise. Then the work begins. The\ntalent agency begins casting the roles, while the production team finds a location and\narranges site use with owners, police, and other officials. If sets are needed, they have to be\nbuilt. Finding the props is a test of ingenuity, and the prop person may wind up visiting hard-\nware stores, secondhand stores, and maybe even the local dump. Costumes must be made, lo-\ncated, or bought.\nThe Shoot The director shoots the commercial scene by scene, but not necessarily in the order\nset down in the script. Each scene is shot, called a take,and after all the scenes in the storyboard\nhave been shot they are assembled through editing. If the director films the commercial on video-\ntape, it is played back immediately to determine what needs correcting. Film, however, has to be\nprocessed before the director can review it. These processed scenes are called dailies.Rushesare\n1. Message Design 2. Preproduction 3. Production (the Shoot) 4.

The director and\nthe agency creative team, as well as the client representative, view them immediately after the\nshoot to make sure everything’s been filmed as planned.\nThe film crew includes a number of technicians, all of whom report to the director. For both\nfilm and video recording, the camera operators are the key technicians. Other technicians\ninclude—and you’ve probably seen these terms in movie credits—the gaffer, who is the chief\nelectrician, and the grip, who moves props and sets and lays tracks for the dolly on which the\ncamera is mounted. The script clerk checks the dialogue and other script details and times the\nscenes. Aset is a busy crowded place that appears, at times, to be total confusion and chaos.\nTheaudiodirectorrecordstheaudioeitheratthetimeoftheshootor,inthecaseofmore\nhigh-end productions, separately in a sound studio.

An-\nother example comes from Boston University where an advertising class starred in a McDonald’s\nMcCafé spot called the “Coffee Ambush,” as described in the A Matter of Practicefeature.\nIn some rare cases, an entire commercial is shot as one continuous action rather than indi-\nvidual shots edited together in postproduction. Probably the most interesting use of this ap-\nproach is “Cog,” an award-winning commercial for the Honda Accord that shows the assembly\nof pieces of the car piece by piece. It begins with a rolling transmission bearing, and moves\nthrough valves, brake pedals, tires, the hood, and so forth, until the car drives away at the end of\nthe commercial. It’s tempting to think it was created through computer animation, but the Honda\n“Cog” commercial was filmed in real time without any special effects. It took 606 takes for the\nwhole thing to work—that’s 606 run-throughs of the sequence!
