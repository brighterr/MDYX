Under the Lanham Trademark Act of\n1947, the PTO protects unique trademarks from infringement by competitors.\nEven an audio trademark is protected, as a case in the European Union (EU) illustrates. A\ndistinctive audio sound based on the noise of a cock crowing and the way it was represented in\nDutch had been registered with the EU’s trademark office. When this sound trademark was used\nby a different company, the first company sued for trademark infringement.\nArecent trademark issue is protection for uniform resource locators (URLs),which are In-\nternet domain names. URLs need to be registered to be protected just like any other trademark.\nThey are issued on a first-come, first-served basis for any domain name not identical to an exist-\ning brand name.\nAcopyrightgives an organization the exclusive right to use or reproduce original work, such\nas an advertisement or package design, for a specified period of time. The Library of Congress\ncontrols copyright protection. Copyrighting of coined words, phrases, illustrations, characters,\nand photographs can offer some protection from other advertisers who borrow too heavily from\ncompetitors. Commonly used designs or symbols, however, cannot be copyrighted. Nor can ideas\nbe copyrighted. For a copyright to be obtained, a work must be fixed in a tangible medium. Copy-\nright infringement can occur when a product is used in an ad without proper permission.

In 1980, in con-\njunction with its ruling on Central Hudson Gas and Electric v. Public Service Commission of New\nYork,the Supreme Court established a test that determines to what extent the government can re-\nstrict advertising. This decision also stipulated the degree to which advertising is considered com-\nmercial speech, although a recent 2010 Supreme Court decision enhanced the free speech rights\nof corporations, particularly for political speech.\nAnumberofcaseshaveattemptedtochangethecommonviewofadvertisingascommer-\ncialspeech.Mostnotably,theSupremeCourtstruckdownaMassachusettslawthatrestricted\ntobaccoadvertising.Freespeechadvocatesapplaudedthedecisionwhilecriticsoftobaccocom-\npanieslamented.Althoughnooneexpectsadvertisingtohavethesameconstitutionalprotection\noffreespeechthatisgiventoindividuals,courtsthroughoutthecountryarenarrowingthegap.\nThe Supreme Court permits some restrictions on commercial speech. For example, the court\nhas held that false or misleading commercial speech can be banned. Even truthful commercial\nspeech can be restricted if the government can prove the public good demands such restrictions.32\nThe courts have also ruled that such acts as the federal ban on junk faxes is valid and that busi-\nnesses’right to commercial speech does not include printing their advertisements on other peo-\nple’s fax machines.\nCHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY 83\nEssentially, the Supreme Court has ruled that only truthful commercial speech is protected,\nnot misleading or deceptive statements. Because the nation’s courts continue to reinterpret how\nthe First Amendment applies in different cases, advertisers need to keep close track of legal de-\nvelopments. The following list summarizes First Amendment decisions by the U.S. Supreme\nCourt that affect advertising:\nFirst Amendment Rulings on Commercial Speech\n• Valentine v. Chrestensen (1942)The Constitution protects free expression but not purely\ncommercial advertising. The Court seemed to be saying that advertising isn’t “speech” under\nthe First Amendment, and it’s questionable whether the Court actually intended the “purely\ncommercial” wording to have any real meaning.\n• Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council (1976)States\ncannot prohibit pharmacists from advertising prices of prescription drugs because the free\nflow of information is indispensable.\n• Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation v. Public Service Commission of New York\n(1980)Public Service Commission’s prohibition of promotional advertising by utilities is\nfound to be unconstitutional, placing limitations on government regulation of unlawful, non-\ndeceptive advertising.\n• Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Company of Puerto Rico (1986)Puerto Ri-\ncan law banned advertising of gambling casinos to residents of Puerto Rico. Asignificant\npoint in this case was Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Rehnquist’s comment that the\ngreater power of a legislature to ban gambling altogether most certainly included the lesser\npower to ban only the advertising of gambling.\n• Cincinnati v. Discovery Network (1993)The Court ruled that the Cincinnati City Council\nviolated the First Amendment’s protection of commercial speech when it banned news racks\nof advertising brochures from city streets for aesthetic and safety reasons, while permitting\nnewspaper vending machines.\n•\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LANHAM TRADEMARK ACT<|>EVENT<|>The Lanham Trademark Act of 1947 is a federal statute that governs trademarks, service marks, and unfair competition, providing protection for unique trademarks from infringement by competitors)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PTO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Patent and Trademark Office is responsible for protecting unique trademarks under the Lanham Trademark Act)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN UNION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The European Union is a political and economic union of member states located primarily in Europe, which has its own trademark office for registering trademarks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIBRARY OF CONGRESS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Library of Congress controls copyright protection in the United States, offering exclusive rights to use or reproduce original works)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEEPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Peeps is a brand known for its marshmallow chicks and bunnies, which sued American Greetings for unauthorized use of its images)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN GREETINGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>American Greetings is a company that was sued by the maker of Peeps for using pictures of Peeps without authorization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRST AMENDMENT<|>EVENT<|>The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects freedom of speech and the press, and its application to advertising and commercial speech has been subject to various court rulings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPREME COURT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest federal court, which has made significant rulings on the extent of First Amendment protections for commercial speech)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL HUDSON GAS & ELECTRIC CORPORATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation was involved in a landmark Supreme Court case that established a test for government restrictions on advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF NEW YORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Public Service Commission of New York was involved in a Supreme Court case regarding the prohibition of promotional advertising by utilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VALENTINE V.
