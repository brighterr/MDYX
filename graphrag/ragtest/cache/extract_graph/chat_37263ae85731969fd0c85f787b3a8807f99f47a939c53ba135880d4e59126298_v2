The mission statement is unique,\nfocused, and differentiating. Tom’s of Maine states its mission clearly on its website:\n“Through the years, we have been guided by one simple notion—do what is right, for our\ncustomers, employees, communities, and environment. We call this Natural Care—a phi-\nlosophy that guides what we make and all that we do.”\nThe Marketing Plan\nAmarketing planis developed for a brand or product line and evaluated annually, although sec-\ntions dealing with long-term goals might operate for a number of years. To a large extent, the mar-\nketing plan mirrors the company’s business plan and contains many of the same components,\nalthough they are focused on a specific brand rather than the larger organization or corporation.\nFigure 7.3illustrates the steps involved in creating a marketing plan.\nExternal\nEnvironment\nAnalysis\nBusiness Goal Strategy Tactical Feedback\nResearch Implementation\nMission Formulation Formulation Formulation and Control\nInternal\nEnvironment\nAnalysis\nFIGURE 7.2\nSteps in the Development of a Business Plan\nThe business planning process begins with a mission statement and moves through research, goal setting, strategy statements, identifications\nof tactics, implementation processes, and controls (meetingthe budget and quality standards, for example). The entire process is monitored through feedback.\nSource: Philip Kotler, Marketing Management, 13th ed., Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2009: 48.

A set of “what’s going on”\nquestions helps structure this market analysis.\nAnswers to these questions help define the key\nmarketing problem and, ultimately, the SWOTs,\nwhich stands for strengths, weaknesses, oppor-\ntunities and threats:\n• What is happening with the brand and the\ncategory?\n• How is it happening?\n• Where is it happening?\n• When is it happening?\n• To whom is it happening?\nWe could answer those questions for Coke\nZero by summarizing the market situation and\nThis mission statement\nthe key problem facing Coke Zero as a marketplace for diet drinks that appealed primarily to\nfor Tom’s of Maine\nwomen, thus leaving out the large number of young male pop drinkers who make up the largest\nhelps its managers\nportion of the soft drink market.\ndevelop specific\nThe objectives at the marketing level tend to be focused on sales levels and share of mar- business objectives and\nket, measurements referring to the percentage of the category purchases that are made by the goals. It also guides all\nbrand’s customers. Other objectives deal with specific areas of the marketing mix, such as distri- of the company’s\nbution, where an objective might detail how a company will open a new territory. marketing\nFor marketing communication (marcom) managers, the most important part of the market- communication efforts.\ning plan is the marketing mix strategy,which includes decisions about the target market, brand\nposition, product design and performance, pricing, and distribution, as well as marketing com-\nmunication. Product design and formulation decisions are sometimes responses to consumer\ntrends, such as the increase in the number of packaged foods making high-fiber claims (think\nFiber One with its expanded line of cereals and snack bars). Other challenges to marketing plan-\nners came from the competition. When McDonald’s began advertising its Angus burger in 2009,\nthe Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. chains responded with taste challenges, mail-in refund promotions, and\nparodies of Big Mac advertisements.2\nIdentify Select Select Develop Design\nExecute\nThreats and Marketing Target Marketing Action\nPlans\nOpportunities Objectives Markets Mix Strategies Plans\nMeasure\nResults/\nTake Action\nFIGURE 7.3\nSteps in the Development of a Marketing Plan\nAmarketing plan begins with an analysis of the marketing situation in terms of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Setting ob-\njectives is the next step. Target markets are selected and marketing strategies are developed, as well as action plans and specific executions of\nideas and programs. The plan is evaluated and that information feeds back into the next generation of planning.\n194 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nThis marketing analysis—and the marketing mix strategy derived from it—link the overall\nstrategic business plan with specific marketing programs, including advertising and other IMC areas.\nWhether to use a frequency club, an advertising campaign, or a sales promotion strategy to increase\nbrand loyalty, for example, are marketing communication decisions that support marketing strategies.\nAnew contributor to this process is crowdsourcing, which we mentioned in the previous\nchapter. This practice mobilizes a digital crowd to provide collective intelligence. For example,\nconsider how Wikipedia operates with experts contributing and reviewing entries. In a marketing\nenvironment, crowdsourcing can be used to channel the latent wisdom of online crowds includ-\ning experts as well as average citizens. John Fluevog Open Source Footwear is a company that\ninvites anyone to contribute ideas for shoes. Decisions about the best ideas are made through peer\nvoting, feasibility, and admittedly what the owner John Fluevog likes.
