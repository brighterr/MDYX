Some retailers are selling\nas much online as they do from their stores—a successful clicks-and-bricks strategy. In addition\nto online business, retailers have found interesting ways to use the Web for marketing communi-\ncation. Some fashion retailers, for example, employ their own bloggers who review the store’s\nlines.12\nStaying on top of fashion is challenging for trendy retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch,\nwhich really suffered during the recent recession. Even with a high level of sale prices, the re-\ntailer’s woes seemed to suggest a more basic problem with its “once unerring sense of style.” An-\nalysts said that A&F’s look was stale and the company was no longer in touch with hot trends.13\nRetail, particularly in fashion, can be a tricky business.\nBUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKETING COMMUNICATION\nAs we explained early in the book, advertising directed at people in business who buy or specify\nproducts for business use is called business-to-business (B2B) advertising.Business marketing\nis the marketing of goods and services to other businesses. Although personal selling is the most\ncommon method of communicating with business buyers, business advertising is used to create\ncorporate brand awareness, enhance the company’s reputation, support salespeople and other\nchannel members, and generate new business leads. It also reinforces the brand position as the In-\nterprint ad illustrates.\nB2B Buying Behavior\nBusinesses buy goods and services for two basic reasons: (1) they need ingredients for the prod-\nPrinciple\nucts they manufacture, and (2) they need goods (such as computers, desks, and chairs) and ser-\nB2B buyers are driven by\nrational, pragmatic vices (legal, accounting, maintenance) for their business operations.

Buying decisions are often made by committees on behalf of the\naddressed by B2B people who use the products, and the actual purchase is negotiated by a specialist in that category\nadvertising. called a buyer.Department stores, for example, have a team of buyers who select the merchan-\ndise for their different departments.\nPurchasing objectives in B2B marketing\ncenter on rational, pragmatic considerations\nsuch as price, service, quality of the good or ser-\nvice, and assurance of supply. For that reason,\nB2B communication tends to use rational strate-\ngies and focus on reasons and benefits.\nTypes of B2B Marketing\nCommunication\nBusinesses are grouped according to the North\nAmerican Industry Classification System\n(NAICS), which was formerly known as the\nStandard Industrial Classification (SIC) system\n(seewww.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html).
