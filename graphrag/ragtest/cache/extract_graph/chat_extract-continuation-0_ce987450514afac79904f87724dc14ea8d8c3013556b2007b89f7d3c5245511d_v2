Web video is becoming a new business opportunity for\nbusinesses that want to use videos to display their products. The secret is to plan these videos specif-\nically for a small screen and not just try to use regular television or film images because the screen\nis just a fraction of the size of a television and a lot of the detail in an image can get lost.12\nIf a site is well designed, people may want to interact with the organization sponsoring the\nsite. For example, Texture/Media, a Boulder, Colorado, Web design firm, created a seven-episode\nseries over five months that detailed the journey of two men attempting to climb the Meru Sharksfin\nsummit in India, for client Marmot Mountain Works. Called ClimbMeru.com, it chronicled the\nteam’s training and trip and hosted contest giveaways that helped gather information about Marmot’s\ncustomers. Texture/Media’s objective with its award-winning websites is to make the consumer\na participant in its brand stories.\nLooking Ahead\nThis is the last chapter in Part 3 on the design of the message.

The Altoids campaign has a strong, consistent look strengthened by the continuing presence of the\ndistinctive Altoids tin. Repetition of the look is the key to brand recognition.\nThe brand is recognizable because it builds on the principle that the more times viewers see an ad with\na consistent format, the more likely they are to remember the product. Another lesson to be learned from the\ncuriously strong mint: Even though campaigns change, sometimes brands have accrued valuable equity in the\nprevious work that needs to be maintained and protected.\nCHAPTER 10 • VISUAL COMMUNICATION 319\nThe “Curiously Strong Mints” campaign is one of the most awarded and successful campaigns. The ad-\nvertising has garnered multiple awards, including a long string of Kelly Awards for magazine advertising, One\nShow creative prizes, and multiple Clios. It won an international effectiveness award when it received the New\nYork Festival’s Grand Prix award. The Magazine Publishers of America (MPA) bestowed its $100,000 Grand\nPrize Kelly Award for outstanding magazine advertising for the Altoids “Burn Through” campaign, which\nlaunched Altoids gum.\nThe low-cost, edgy campaign has also been a business builder. The brand had virtually no presence in 1995\nwhen Kraft bought it, but by 2000 it dominated the extreme mint market with a 25 percent share. Altoids now\nis the number one selling mint in the United States. Although it is difficult to predict how the current generation\nof edgy campaigns will fare, the “Brainstorm” branded entertainment effort shows promise. The trailer alone\nwas viewed more than 100,000 times. Its creators expect to attract 2.5 million views over a six-month period.\nWhat makes Altoids advertising a winner?
