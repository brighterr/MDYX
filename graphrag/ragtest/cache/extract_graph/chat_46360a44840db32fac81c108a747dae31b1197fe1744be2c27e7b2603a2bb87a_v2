Sponsors for major golf tournaments, for exam-\nple, are expected to invest between $6 million and $8 million. The A Matter of Practicebox dis-\ncusses the explosion of sports-related promotions.\nCompanies undertake sponsorships to build brand associations and increase the perceived\nvalue of the brand in the consumer’s mind. The important thing is that the event must project the\nright image for the brand. That’s particularly important in troubled economic times when com-\npanies with budget problems find it hard to justify spending money on glitzy events. Companies\nthat use sponsorships focus their efforts on supporting causes and events that matter most to em-\nployees and customers. Unilever signed on as sponsor for the Today Show’sfood and recipe web-\nsite, called Cooking School. The idea is to feature Unilever’s brands, such as Bertolli, Country\nCrock, and Ragu. Although the most common sponsorships are around events, particularly sport-\ning events, brands can also sponsor product-related websites that are particularly effective at cre-\nating sales or recruiting people. The 2BLIKEu.com network is a consumer products social\nnetwork that lets companies sponsor product pages.\nHundreds of companies sponsor NASCAR cars both to reach the sport’s expanding fan base\nand to link their brand to a winning car and driver. Sponsors shell out in excess of $650 million\nto get NASCAR’s top 35 cars in the Nextel Cup Series to put their logos on the car. The invest-\nment pays. Marketing analysts estimate that Dale Earnhardt, Jr., earns the equivalent of $150 mil-\nlion in televised exposure time for his sponsor Budweiser, quite a bargain considering\nAnheuser-Busch, and other sponsors, spend much less on the sponsorships.\nJust think about sponsorships associated with football bowl games and other sporting events.\nThe first bowl to have a sponsor, the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl, led the way in 1986, followed by the\nTostitos Fiesta Bowl, the Outback Bowl, the Meinecke Car Care Bowl, and others. Atwist on the\nsports sponsorship concept comes from convenience store chain 7-Eleven, which made a deal\nwith the Chicago White Sox that their games would start at 7:11. Of course, when the club lost\nthe 7-Eleven sponsorship, it also got a new start time—7:10.\nThe importance of sponsorships is growing worldwide. Mengniu Milk, a Mongolian milk\ncompany, raised its profile by backing the NBAin China. Beyond exposure, these events give\ncorporations the opportunity to build their image and reputation by associating with an activity\nthat audiences enjoy.16\nEvent Marketing The term event marketingdescribes the practice of linking a brand to an event,\nsuch as the Jose Cuervo beach volleyball tournament. Marketers use related promotional events,\nsuch as a tour or the appearance of the product or its spokesperson at a mall or sporting event, to\ngain the attention and participation of people in the target audience who attend the event. The\nevent showcases the brand, often with sampling, coupons, other incentives, and attention-getting\nstunts. To be successful, the event must match the brand to the target market’s lifestyle.\nCHAPTER 17 • PROMOTIONS 533\nA MATTER OF PRACTICE\nAdvertising through Sports\nJohn Sweeney,Professor, Head of Advertising and Director of Sports Communication Program,\nUniversity of North Carolina\nThere has been remarkable growth Football League makes $2 billion a year in media\nin the relationship between sports rights and sells more than $3 billion in licensed goods.\nand advertising.
