They use words that whip and batter, plead, sob, cajole,\nand impress. They know the meanings, derivations, moods, and feelings of words and the re-\nverberations and vibrations they create in a reader’s mind. Aclassic ad, titled “The Wonderful\nWorld of Words,” expresses this fascination. Ahouse ad for the business-to-business agency\nMarsteller Inc., it was written by Bill Marsteller, another advertising legend. He also was co-\nfounder of public relations agency Burson-Marsteller. Here is an excerpt from this ad:\n“Human beings come in all sizes, a variety of colors, in different ages, and with unique,\ncomplex and changing personalities.\nSo do Words.\nThere are tall, skinny words, and short, fat ones, and strong ones and weak ones, and\nboy words and girl words.\nFor instance, title, lattice, latitude, lily, tattle, Illinois, and intellect are all lean and\nlanky. While these words get their height partly out of t’s and l’s and i’s, other words are\ntall and skinny without a lot of ascenders and descenders. Take, for example, Abraham,\npeninsula and ellipsis, all tall.\nHere are some nice short-fat words: hog, yogurt, bomb, pot, bon-bon, acne, plump, sop\nand slobber.”\nIn addition to having an ear for the perfect phrase, copywriters listen to the way people talk\nand identify the tone of voice that best fits the target audience and the brand. An example comes\nfrom an all-copy ad for British Airlines. Set up like a poem with definite rhythm and alliteration,\nthe copy block begins and ends with the airlines initials, but in between it lyrically interprets what\n“upgrading” to BAmeans to a passenger:\nBe a guest not a a seat,it’s about watching. In short,\npassenger.We believe getting service. it’s about upgrading\nThe way you fly is Not just food flying for every\njust as important but a meal. Not passenger on\nas where you fly. just something every plane. Now\nIt’s not simply to watch but there’s an ideA.\nabout getting something worth\nSource:Courtesy of British Airways plc.\n262 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nLike poets, copywriters may spend hours, even days, crafting a paragraph. After many revi-\nsions, others read the copy and critique it. It then goes back to the writer, who continues to fine-\ntune it. Copywriters must have thick skins as there is always someone else reading their work,\ncritiquing it, and asking for changes. Versatility is a common trait of copywriters. They can move\nfrom toilet paper to Mack trucks and shift their writing style to match the product and the lan-\nguage of their target audience.\nAs Professor Mallia suggested in the Part III opener, copywriters can rejoice because the\npower of words remains strong even with new visual media. She says, “The power of words doesn’t\nrest in their volume, but in their clever combination. In fact, the fewer the words, the more im-\nportant every single one becomes—and the more critical copywriting talent becomes.” The skill,\nshe explains, is to “distill a thought down to its most concise, precise, and unexpected expression.\nThat’s the reason the craft isn’t about to disappear anytime soon, and great copywriters will al-\nways be in demand. Think ‘Got Milk?’and ‘Think different’and see true mastery of the craft.\nEach tagline is just two words but rich in meaning and power.”\nThe Art and Science of Names\nThe most important word selection in marketing communication is the brand or corporate name.\nLow-cost airline JetBlue was originally founded in 1999 as New Air but its founders realized it\nneeded a more distinctive name. They considered naming it Taxi and painting\nthe planes yellow, but backed off because of negative associations with New\nYork City taxis and questionable service. JetBlue has been a good choice be-\ncause it states the business (jet (cid:4)airlines), as well as sky (blue) with its calm-\ning connotations.\nMany brand names are made up, but it’s not just names that are created by\nmarketing communicators. The “uncola” position was created for 7-Up and\nmore recently the True Value hardware chain has proclaimed itself “masters of\nall things hardwarian,” a phrase that suggests mastery of a traditional art or\nskill.\nThere is a science to letters, as well as words. Research has determined\nthat letters with a hard edge like Tor K suggest effectiveness (Kodak, Target,\nTide); X and Z relate to science (Xcel, Zantac, Xerox) ; C, L, R, P, and S are\ncalming or relaxing (Cialis, Lexus, Puffs, Revlon, Silk); and Z means speed\n(Zippo, Ziplock, Zappos.com). In the erectile dysfunction category, Lilly’s drug\nCialis is derived from ciel,the French word for sky and was chosen because it\nis a smooth, soft sound that connotes a sense of intimacy. In contrast, Pfizer’s\nViagra evokes the power of Niagara Falls.1\nAdvertising Writing Style\nIn almost all situations, advertising has to win its audience, no small task given\nthat it usually competes in a cluttered environment and the audience is gener-\nally inattentive and uninterested. For that reason, the copy should be as simple\nas possible—think “Eat Mor Chikin.” Chick-fil-A’s single line of copy is suc-\ncinct and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
