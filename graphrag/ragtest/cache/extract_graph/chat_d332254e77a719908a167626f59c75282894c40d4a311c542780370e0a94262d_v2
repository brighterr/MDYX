For example, promotions\nalone cannot create an image for a brand. They cannot do much to change negative attitudes to-\nward a product, overcome product problems, or reposition a brand. Brand building, however, is\nan interesting challenge to promotion, so let’s look at it in more depth.\nThe Issue of Brand Building For years a heated debate has focused on sales promotion and\nbrandbuilding.Advertisersclaimthestrengthofadvertisingiscreatingandmaintainingbrand\nimage,andsalespromotion’spricedealsactuallynegatealltheirhardworkbydivertingtheem-\nphasis from the brand to the price.The result, sales promotion critics complain, is a brand-\ninsensitiveconsumer.ConsiderMcDonald’s,whichhaslongbaseditsimageoneverydayvalue,\noneofthefourpillarsofMcDonald’smarketingmantra:quality,service,cleanliness,andvalue\n(QSC&V).Advertiserscontendthatpricepromotionslikea99-centBigMacdamagemorethan\nthe company’s bottom line because the price promotion undercuts the value pillar. In other\nwords,ifvalueiscentraltoMcDonald’spricing,thenitwouldn’tneedtoofferspecialsaleprices.\nOntheotherhand,indifficulteconomictimes,thespecial-pricestrategymayalsoconveythe\nmessagethatcompaniesaresensitivetocustomers’needsandadjustingitspricesinordertobe\nsupportive.\nProcter & Gamble’s division manager of advertising and sales promotion explains it this\nway: “Too many marketers no longer adhere to the fundamental premise of brand building, which\nis that [brand] franchises aren’t built by cutting price but rather by offering superior quality at a\nreasonable price and clearly communicating that value to consumers.” The price-cutting promo-\ntions began in the 1970s fostering a buy-only-on-sale orientation that some branding experts be-\nlieve has caused long-term brand building to suffer. Critics point to a general decline in consumer\nbrand loyalty as just one negative result of price-based promotions.\nThe problem is that brand building is a long and time-consuming process of establishing the\nbrand’s core values. Promotion, whether a sale price, premium, coupon, or some other incentive,\nis inherently short term, so the promotion can undermine the brand’s established values if not han-\ndled carefully. Analyst Doug Brookes says that even in economic downturns promotion strategies\ncan be designed to balance both long-term brand building and short-term price promotion with\nthe help of predictive analytic techniques that optimize ROI.20\nSales promotion experts argue that their practices can help to build brand image. They refer\nto many cereal brands, rental car companies, airlines, and hotels that have used a variety of well-\nplanned sales promotion strategies (like loyalty programs, for example) to enhance their brand\nimages. An example comes from a classic promotional ad for Eagle Shirtmakers. Second, they\nacknowledge that continuous promotion—particularly continuous price promotion—does not\nwork well with brand building, except for discount marketers, whose image is built on the notion\nof sale prices, although even Walmart is rethinking its “always low prices” positioning strategy.\nAccording to one industry expert, the solution is to make advertising more accountable and\npromotion more brand focused. In other words, the advertising and promotion need to work more\nclosely together and, in particular, short-term campaigns shouldn’t be at odds with one another.\nMore integration is needed when planning marketing communication programs.\nPromotion Integration\nAdvertising and promotion both contribute to the effectiveness of a marketing communication\nplan, primarily because they do different things and have different objectives. In an effective plan,\nCHAPTER 17 • PROMOTIONS 539\nCLASSIC\nSan Francisco ad man Howard Gossage was known for his sense of humor and tongue-in-the-cheek promotional ideas. This ad for Eagle\nShirtmakers featured what you might call a premium—a handkerchief made from the shirt fabric, which also made it a sample. The wry\ncopy is in classic Gossage ad writing style.\nthe two work together, along with other marketing communication tools, to accomplish the over-\nall marketing communication objectives.\nThe major differences between advertising and sales promotion concern their methods of ap-\npeal and the value they add to the sale of the product or service. Advertising is primarily used to\ncreate a brand image and high levels of brand awareness over time; promotions are primarily used\nto create immediate action. To accomplish this immediate goal, sales promotion may rely heavily\non rational appeals, such as price deals. In contrast, advertising often relies on emotional appeals\nto promote the product’s image. In other words, advertising tends to add intangible value—brand\npersonality and image—to the good or service. Promotions add tangible value to the good or ser-\nvice and contribute greatly to the profitability of the brand.\nHere is a summary of the differences between these two marketing tools in terms of their pri-\nmary orientations:\nAdvertising Sales Promotion\n• Creates a brand image over time. • Creates immediate action.\n• Relies on emotional appeals. • Added value strategies rely on rational appeals;\nimpulse appeals use emotion.\n• Adds intangible value to a product or • Adds tangible value to product or service.\nservice through image.\n• Contributes moderately to short-term • Contributes greatly to short-term profitability.\nprofitability.\n540 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nSomeobjectivesthatadvertisingandpromotionshareincludeincreasingthenumberofcustomers\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
