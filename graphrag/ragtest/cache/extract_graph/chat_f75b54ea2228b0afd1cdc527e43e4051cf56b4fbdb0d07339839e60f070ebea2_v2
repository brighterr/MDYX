If you’re hungry (a feeling drives a purchase decision), you grab a candy bar without much\ninformation search. If you try a sample product and like it (behavior is the driver), then you may\nbuy the product without much evaluation of alternatives. In other words, not all responses begin\nwith thinking about a product, nor do they follow the same route to a decision. Table 5.3illus-\ntrates the many ways a purchase decision can be made.\nGiven all of the different ways consumers go about making a brand choice, you can see why\nbrand planners need to know how this decision process works for a specific product category. Ob-\nviously the message would be different for a consumer who is searching for information to buy a\ncomputer and considering the differences between brands in comparison to someone who makes\nan impulse purchase like buying a soft drink. That’s why this information becomes an important\npart of a consumer profile when identifying prospects to target in a campaign.\nInfluences on B2B Decision Making Many of the influences that affect consumer buying also are\nreflected in business-to-business marketing. However, we also know that B2B decision making\ngenerally follows the informational route. Emotion may still be important in certain situations\n(e.g., the buyer wants to impress the boss), but ultimately these decisions usually are more rational\nthan emotional for the following reasons:\n• In organizational buying, many individuals are involved in reviewing the options, often with\na buying committee making the final decision.\n• Although the business buyer may be motivated by both rational and emotional factors, the\nuse of rational and quantitative criteria dominates most decisions.\n• The decision is sometimes made based on a set of specifications to potential suppliers who\nthen bid on the contract. Typically in these purchases, the lowest bid wins.\n• The decision may span a considerable time period and create a lag between the initial con-\ntact and final decision. On the other hand, once a decision is made, it may be in place for a\nlong time and sometimes is supported by a contract.\n• Qualityishugelyimportant,andrepeatpurchasesarebasedonhowwelltheproductperforms.\n• Personal selling is also important in B2B marketing, so advertising is used to open the door\nand generate leads for the sales force.\nTARGETING THE RIGHT AUDIENCE\nTraditionally a market is first divided to identify segments, and then potentially profitable seg-\nments are selected to be the target audience for a marketing communication effort. Through\ntargeting,the organization can design specific communication strategies to match the audience’s\nneeds and wants and position the product in the most relevant way to match their interests. Tar-\ngeting is also the key factor in selecting the right media.\nCHAPTER 5 • SEGMENTING AND TARGETING THE AUDIENCE 153\nConsider, for example, how Niman Ranch of Bolinas, California, built a luxury brand for its\nbeef. The obvious target would be upscale consumers who value natural food and are willing to\npay more for the best. But that’s not the route Niman Ranch took. Instead it bypassed consumers\nand marketed directly to prestigious chefs whose restaurants featured the brand on their menus.\nBy using an innovative targeting strategy, Niman moved from commodity to a cachet brand that\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
