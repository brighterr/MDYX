During the Cold\nWaritcreatedaprecursortotheWorldWideWeb,calledtheAdvancedResearch\nProjects Agency Network, better known as ARPANET. So when the U.S. Army\nwantedtoincreaseitsranks,itwasano-brainertousedigitalmediaforrecruiting.\nThe revolution from analog to digital technology has brought about two fun-\ndamental changes facilitated in part by the invention of the personal computer.\nFirst, it made it possible to produce and copy information exactly. Second, it be-\ncame easy to move information between media and to access or distribute it re-\nmotely. Interactivity became key.\nThese abilities have transformed the way people do business. Think about\nwhat you can do with your computer. You can buy music, make airline reservations,\nsee how that sweater you’re thinking about buying looks in red, or find exotic types\nof licorice, publish your own blog, participate in social media, and so on—all things\nthat would have been impossible before, say, 1995.\nIt also means that those who are afraid to embrace the changing media envi-\nronment are in danger of getting left behind. Clearly the U.S. Army is marching to\na different drummer when it comes to recruiting than it did before. Here’s what it\ndid to reach its core audience of 17- to 24-year-olds to achieve the goal of recruit-\ning more than 100,000 new soldiers each year.\nIt used the latest technologies to show the variety of exciting career opportu-\nnities available in the U.S. Army. Since the 1980s the U.S. Army’s use of media has\nshifted dramatically away from traditional radio and print media to the Internet.\nIt also took advantage of the growth of event marketing, unheard of in the\n1980s. By 2007, event marketing accounted for about a fifth of the U.S. Army’s\ntotal marketing budget. The U.S. Army typically has sponsored events such as\nNASCAR and rodeo bull riding because they shared a common target audience.
