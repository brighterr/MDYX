Subheads are sectional headlines and are also used to break up a mass of\n“gray”type(ortypethattendstoblurtogetherwhenoneglancesatit)intoalargeblockofcopy.\nTaglines are short catchy phrases and particularly memorable phrases used at the end of an\nad to complete or wrap up the creative idea. An ad from the Nike women’s campaign used the\nheadline “You are a nurturer and a provider. You are beautiful and exotic” set in an elegant script.\nThe tagline on the next page used a rough, hand-drawn, graffiti-like image that said, “You are not\nfalling for any of this.”\nSlogans, which are repeated from ad to ad as part of a campaign or a long-term brand iden-\ntity effort, also may be used as taglines. To be successful, these phrases have to be catchy and mem-\norable, although many corporate slogans fall back into marketing language or clichés and come\nacross as leaden (“Total quality through excellence,” “Excellence through total quality,” or “Where\nquality counts”). Wells Fargo, for example, uses “Together we’ll go far,” which is not distinctive,\ncould be used by any company, and says nothing about Wells Fargo or its business. Accenture uses\n“High performance. Delivered.” which also is nondistinctive and not very memorable.\nThe best ones have a close link to the brand name: “With a name like Smucker’s, it has to\nbe good,” “America runs on Dunkin’,” and “Ford Tough.” “Finger lickin’good” for KFC doesn’t\nuse the brand name, but still is highly recognizable because it connects with the product (fried\nchicken) and has been in use since 1952. That’s another characteristic of a good slogan, it is\nenduring—slogans are rarely changed. Atrue classic, Maxwell House’s “Good to the last drop,”\nhas been used since 1915 and Morton Salt’s “When it rains, it pours” has been around since 1914.\nOfcourse,theyalsohavetobeoriginalasWisconsinitesfoundoutwhentheofficialstateslo-\nganwaschangedto“LiveLikeYouMeanIt.”Thestatespentsome$50,000onthenewsloganand\nthenlaterdiscoveredthatithadpreviouslybeenusedasthetaglineinaBacardiRumcampaign.7\nConsider the distinctiveness and memorability of the following slogans\nTEST YOURSELF\nMatch the Company with Its Slogan:\n1.
