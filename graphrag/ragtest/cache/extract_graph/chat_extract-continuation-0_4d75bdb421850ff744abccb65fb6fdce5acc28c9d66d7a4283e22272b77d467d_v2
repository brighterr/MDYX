Intangibles include the product’s perceived value, its brand image,\npositive and negative impressions and feelings, and past experiences customers have had with the\nbrand or company. Intangibles are just as important as the tangible features because they create\nthe emotional bonds people have with their favorite brands and because they are impossible for\nthe competition to copy.\nBut even intangibles can lend monetary value and legal protection to a brand’s unique iden-\ntity. Read Tales of Twitterjacking at www.pearsonhighered.com/moriartyand consider the impor-\ntance of a brand presence in a situation faced by Twitter: the hacking and hijacking of its accounts.\nAll the impressions created by a brand’s tangible and intangible features come together as a\nbrand concept—the brand and what it means—that exists in people’s hearts and minds. It results\nnot only from experiences with the product, but also from messages acquired from marketing\ncommunication. Such impressions are particularly important in what we call parity products\nsuch as soap, gasoline, and other products with few distinguishing features. For these products,\nfeelings about the brand can become the critical point of difference.\nThemeaningofabrandisanaggregationofeverythingacustomer(orotherstakeholder)\nsees,hears,reads,orexperiencesaboutacompanyoraspecificbrand.Thismeaning,however,\ncannotbetotallycontrolledbymanagement.Acompanycanownabrandnameandbrandsym-\nbolandinfluencetosomedegreewhatpeoplethinkaboutthebrand,butitcan’tdictatethebrand\nimpressionbecausethatexistsinpeople’smindsandisderived,aswe’vesaid,fromtheirpersonal\nexperiences.\nBrand Transformation Abasic principle of branding is that a brand transforms a product—\nPrinciple\ngoods as well as services—into something more meaningful than the product itself.

Brand transformation creates this difference by enriching the brand meaning. Brand\nmeanings are more complex than impressions because of what they symbolize. The Tiffany brand\nsymbolizes quality, sophistication, and luxury; a Swatch brand is fun and fashionable; a generic\nwatch is inexpensive and utilitarian.\nThe development of the Ivory Soap brand by Procter & Gamble in 1879 represented a ma-\njor advance in branding because of the way its makers built a meaningful brand concept to trans-\nform a parity product—soap—into a powerful brand—Ivory. Just as the Macintosh “1984”\ncommercial in Chapter 1represents one of the all-time great ads, Ivory represents one of the all-\ntime great marketing stories.\nFor some products and categories, the brand is a huge factor in consumer decision mak-\ning.Wesayabrandcreatesvalueforconsumersinthesensethatitmakesiteasiertofindand\nrepurchaseafamiliarproduct.Table2.1liststhetop20brandsintheworldbasedonestimates\noftheirbrandvalue.Googleisthefirst$100billionbrandandhasbeeninthenumberonespot\nfor the previous three years.Analyze this list and see if you can determine how many of the\nglobal leaders are also U.S. leaders.
