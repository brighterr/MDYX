They were described in a national poll as the generation having\nthe most “positive impact” on the American economy for their role in fueling the postwar boom.8\n• Baby boomers,people born between 1946 and 1964, represent the largest age-related cate-\ngory in the United States. The 78 million baby boomer consumers are now in the final years\nof their careers, having made a huge population bulge as they have moved through the life\ncycle. While they were growing up, boomers’numbers affected first schools, then the job\nmarket, and now retirement programs and health care. This generation has been influenced\nby significant societal movements and scientific breakthroughs, from the Civil Rights move-\nment to the anti–Vietnam War protests to putting a person on the moon, although the term\nboomerhas also become associated with greedy, spoiled, divorced, mega-shoppers who\nwant it all.9\n• Anewly identified subgroup called Generation Jonesis the younger baby boomers who were\nborn from the mid- to late 1950s through the mid-1960s. The Jonesreference comes from\ntheir continuing need to chase the dream of affluence by trying to “keep up with the Joneses.”\n• Gen X,also known as Baby Busters,is the group whose 70 million members were born be-\ntween 1965 and 1979. Now adults, they have been described as independent minded and\nsomewhat cynical. They are concerned with their physical health (they grew up during the\nAIDS outbreak) and financial future (the job market became more difficult just about the\ntime they entered).\n• Sometimes referred to as the Me Generationbecause of their affluent younger years, those born\nin the 1970s to early 1990s are characterized as more self-absorbed and narcissistic than their\nparents, although that changed as they confronted the dot.combust at the end of the 1990s.\n• Born between 1980 and 1996, members of Generation Yare also known as Echo Boomers,\nas well as the Me Generation,because they are the children of baby boomers. They are im-\nportant to marketers, because they are next in size to the boomer generation with 100 million\nplus members. This generation is also described as the DigitalorNet Generation10because\nthey grew up with computers and are seen as more technologically savvy than their older\nsiblings or parents. This group is now the young adult market that marketers want most to\nreach because they are in the formative years of their brand relationships. They are the first\ngeneration to grow up with e-mail and cell phones.\n• Millennialsencompass those 80 million children born from the late 1990s into the beginning\ndecade of the new century. Also called the iGeneration,these folks spend considerably more\ntime texting and using social media than even the older Net Generation. Initially marketers\nwere delighted to find that these kids (and their doting parents) were brand conscious and\nmore willing than their predecessors to wear a brand logo as a badge.11But that changed as\nthey became teenagers and had to confront the problems of the recession that dragged down\nthe economy in the late 2000s. They are known as the most environmentally educated gener-\nation with 76 percent believing that brands should be ecologically conscious. They are also\nseen as having outlandish personal expectations and a feeling of entitlement,12although the\nrecession may have toned that down a bit.\nAge is a key factor in media plans because age usually determines what media you watch,\nlisten to, or read. Note how the radio script for the public service LATCH campaign about child\ncar safety, which we introduced in Chapter 4, plays with the idea of generations. The older the\nCHAPTER 5 • SEGMENTING AND TARGETING THE AUDIENCE 141\nage group, the more likely they are to use media daily or several times a week and the more likely\nthey are to read newspapers. Overall usage patterns for each medium vary by age group. For in-\nstance, 88 percent of “mature” audience members watch local broadcast news.13Kids ages 8 to\n18 now spend more than 71/2 hours a day with electronic devices, which include smart phones,\ncomputers, televisions and video games, a finding that shocked researchers in 2010 who thought\nthe day couldn’t continue to expand to fit in more wired activities.14\nAD COUNCIL / US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION\nLATCH Campaign – :60 Radio\nZRAG-11806R\n“Generations”\n1BON-08-0033\n04/30/08 – Produced\n07/1/08 – Final Mix\n07/15/09 – Expiration Date\nVO: First, there was the “Lost Generation.”\nSFX: Music up and under: Jazz Age swing.\nVO: Then came the “Greatest Generation.”\nSFX: Battle sounds.\nVO: Followed by the “Silent Generation.”\nSFX: Silence.\nVO: The “Me Generation.”\nSFX: Acid rock.\nVO: And “Generation X.”\nSFX: Video game sounds.\nVO: Now comes the over-scheduled, over-protected, hyper-parented\ngeneration…\nSFX: Baby’s laugh.\nVO: …three out of four of whom are riding in car seats that aren’t being\nused correctly.
