The assumption is that if you like the ad, then that positive feeling will transfer to the ad is important because\nbrand and if you feel positive about the brand, you will be more likely to buy it. Aclassic advertisers hope that\nstudy of advertising testing methods by the Advertising Research Foundation (ARF) found liking the ad will increase\nthat liking—both the brand and the ad—was the best predictor of consumer behavior.26 liking the brand.\nOn the opposite side of liking is aversion,which means people avoid buying a brand\nbecause they don’t like the ads or what they associate with the brand. We don’t like to see\ncondom ads, so they aren’t often found in the mass media. Negative political ads demon-\nstrate the flip side of liking. They are an example of an affective strategy that seems to\nwork by putting opponents on the defensive. They may work through the power of sugges-\ntion, but most people say they dislike these ads because they sometimes seem unfair or\nmean spirited.\n• ResonanceEffective advertisements sometimes create resonance,or a feeling that the mes-\nsage “rings true.” Like relevance, messages that resonate help the consumer identify with the\nbrand on a personal level. Resonance is stronger than liking because it involves an element\nof self-identification. These sympathetic vibes amplify the emotional impact by engaging a\nconsumer in a personal connection with a brand.\nThe Cognition Facet: Think/Understand\nHow many ads that you have seen on television or\nnoticed in print caused you to stop and think about\nthe brand? Can you recall any instance where\nyou learned something new about a product from\nan ad? Have you ever seen an ad you liked and\nthen can’t remember the name of the advertiser?\nAlthough perception and its partner, emotion, are\nthe first effects of an advertising message, an\nadvertisement may generate any of the other\nresponses—cognition, association, persuasion,\nand behavior—next. For this discussion, we’ll\ntalk first about cognitive impact.\nCognition refers to how consumers search\nfor and respond to information, as well as how\nthey learn and understand something. It’s a ra-\ntional response to a message. Some call this a left-\nbrain approach, based on the left–right brain ways\nof thinking that evolved from brain hemisphere\nresearch. Right-brain thinking is presumed to be\nmore emotional and creative. The American Air-\nlines ad uses the left–right brain metaphor to\ndemonstrate the difference between a cognitive\nand an emotional advertising message.\nFactors That Drive the Cognitive Response\nWithacognitiveresponseaconsumermayneed\nsomethingorneedtoknowsomething,andthein-\nformationgatheredinresponsetothatneedleads\nto understanding.

Generally, needsare basic bio-\nlogical motivations but they are also something you think about; wants tend to be based\nmore on feelings and desires. In other words, when we refer to needs, we are usually talking\nabout a message that describes something lacking in consumers’lives and that often stimu-\nlates a cognitive response. Advertisers address consumer needs through informational ads\nthat explain how a product works and what it can do for the user—the benefits it offers to\nthe user. For example, consumers need a virus protection program for their personal comput-\ners, but they also may need an explanation of how the program works. Complicating our un-\nderstanding of needs and wants is the impact of a major event, such as the recent recession.\nAWall Street Journalarticle analyzed the auto industry in terms of the tug between want (a\nCadillac Escapade specially designed on GM’s website to a customer’s order) and need (a\nused car that offers the best value in terms of miles and price) or a need that’s simply post-\nponed because it’s of less significance that other more compelling needs.27\n• Cognitive LearningConsumers learn about products and brands through two primary\nroutes: cognitive learning and conditioned learning.
