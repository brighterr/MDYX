Once the media\nplan is developed, a media-buying unit or team, either in the ad agency or external in a separate\nmedia company, executes it.\nGiven the industry trends, the hot media shops have specialties in new media. For example,\nthe long-established Ogilvy agency launched neo@Ogilvy as a digital-media group to help ad-\nvertisers figure out how to allocate their ad budgets in the vast array of new media, such as on-\nline video, social networking sites, and search advertising. The Inside Storyby David Rittenhouse\nin Chapter 5explained how agencies such as neo@Ogilvy approach the new arena of online be-\nhavioral targeting.\nMedia Research: Information Sources\nSome people believe media decisions are the hub in the advertising wheel because media costs\nare often the biggest element in the marketing communication budget. Not only are media deci-\nsions central to advertising planning, media research is central to media planning. That realiza-\ntion stems from not only the large amount of money thatâ€™s on the line, but also the sheer volume\nof data and information that media planners must gather, sort, and analyze before media planning\ncan begin. Figure 14.1illustrates the wide range of media information sources and the critical role\nmedia research plays in the overall advertising planning process.\nâ€¢ ClientInformationTheclientisagoodsourceforvarioustypesofinformationmediaplan-\nnersuseintheirwork,suchasdemographicprofilesofcurrentcustomers(bothlightand\nheavyusers),responsetopreviouspromotions,productsalesanddistributionpatterns,and,\nmostimportantly,thebudgetofhowmuchcanbespentonmedia.Geographicaldifferencesin\ncategoryandbrandsalesalsoaffecthowthemediabudgetisallocated.Withconsumergoods\nandservicesespecially,ratesofconsumptioncandiffergreatlyfromoneregiontoanother.\nâ€¢ Market ResearchIndependently gathered information about markets and product categories\nis another valuable tool for media planners. Mediamark Research, Inc. (MRI), Scarborough\n(local markets), and Mendelsohn (affluent markets) are research companies that provide this\nservice. This information is usually organized by product category (detergents, cereals,\nsnacks, etc.) and cross-tabulated by audience groups and their consumption patterns. Acces-\nsible online for a fee, this wealth of information can be searched and compared across thou-\nsands of categories, brands, and audience groups. Although the reports may seem\nintimidating, they are not that difficult to use. Figure 14.2is a page from an MRI report\nshowing how to read MRI data. Media planners use MRI data to check which groups, based\non demographics and lifestyles, are high and low in category use, as well as where they live\nand what media they use.\nâ€¢ Competitive Advertising ExpendituresIn highly competitive product categories, such as\npackaged goods and consumer services, marketers track how much competing brands spend\nCHAPTER 14 â€¢ MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 423\nHow to Read an MRI CrossTab\nTheCrossTabformatisastandardresearchdisplayformatthatallowsmultiplevariablesofrelateddatatobegrouped\ntogether.
