But the role of copy in video isn’t always that\nobvious. Consider YouTube’s most-watched brand video from 2009, Evian’s “Skating Babies.”\n(You can view it at www.youtube.com/watch?v(cid:4)_PHnRIn74Ag.) At first you might not see the\nimprint of the writer, but it’s there—in a title card stopping viewers in the middle, and a super at\nthe end. Without that copy, would the video be as meaningful? How would the brand and the story\nconnect? The same is true for the award-winning Cadbury gorilla spot from the United Kingdom.\n(View it at www.youtube.com/watch?v(cid:4)Ow_o78zjo14.) It wouldn’t make any sense with-\nout being anchored by the brand’s tagline, “Aglass and a half full of joy.” It wouldn’t be adver-\ntising, either—just a Phil Collins music video. Creating successful integrated communication\nmeans using every weapon in your arsenal. Sometimes the answer is visual; sometimes the\nsharpest tool is a word. Let’s not forget three of the most persuasive words in the English lan-\nguage, and what they can get people to do: “I love you.” I dare you to find the picture that says\nit better.\nHow do agencies organize, motivate, and inspire their creative people to produce breakthrough\nmarketing communication that engages its target audience?

What issues affect the management of creative strategy and its implementation?\nFrontier: A Whole Different Animal\nWhen low-cost carrier Frontier Airlines started up in 1994, it took off with\nanimals emblazoned on the tails of its planes. Frontier’s distinctive air-\ncraft tails, all of which depict a variety of different wildlife, have made\nFrontier’s brand name synonymous with the airline’s Western heritage. Years of\naward-winningadvertisinghavefirmlyestablishedtheairlinewithitstalkinganimals\nontheplanes’tailsasafavoriteofconsumersintheDenvermarketandbeyond.\nThe economic downturn of 2008 and 2009, however, grounded much of Fron-\ntier’s advertising as the airline was forced into bankruptcy because of a cash-flow\nproblem. Luckily, it emerged from the downturn with a new owner who recognized\nthe value of the brand and its award-winning advertising.\nFrontier’s agency, Grey Worldwide, realized that Denverites were elated that\ntheir hometown airline and its beloved animals would live to see another day. A\nnarrow window to celebrate this great news emerged. And once again, Creative\nDirectors Shawn Couzens and Gary Ennis turned to Larry, Jack, Flip, and the rest\nof the gang for the perfect solution. The campaign had to be written and produced\nquickly and affordably—so it could air while the news was still fresh. And so, in just\na few short weeks, the “Still the One” campaign was born.\nThis is just one example of how nimble the Frontier campaign is. No matter\nwhat the message, or how quick the turnaround, the animals can always deliver it\nin a way that’s engaging and relevant. In fact, the animals have proven so popular,\nthey may end up being the airline’s single most important asset when it comes to\nthe brand’s ultimate survival.\nSo how did it all start? In 2003, Grey Worldwide brought the tail animals to life\nby creating a likable cast of characters—each different and unique in its own way.\nThe humorous ad campaign broke away from the buttoned-up approach used by\nmost airlines by creating an “episodic sitcom” much like SeinfeldorCheers. As a\nresult, consumers built an emotional attachment to the brand and its spokes-\nanimals. And with each new commercial, that connection grew stronger as Frontier\ncontinued to evolve the campaign.\n225\n226 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\n“Flip to Mexico”\nIn 2006, when rival airline United emerged from bankruptcy with a multi-million\ndollar ad campaign, Frontier decided to steal the spotlight by creating a diversion.\nCouzens said, “We wanted to promote our increased service to Mexico. For years,\nFlip the Dolphin had been dying to travel to a warm, tropical climate. But we al-\nways sent him to the cold Windy city of Chicago. It was a long-running joke in our\ncampaign. Well, Flip had had enough. He decided to offer Frontier an ultimatum:\nEither they send him to Mexico, or he would quit.”\nCouzens and Ennis conceptualized the commercials as a news story which would\nunfold and evolve in real time. The “Flip to Mexico” campaign featured ads with Flip,\nfake news spots on Flip’s demand that he be allowed to fly to Mexico, staged\nprotests, podcasts, blogs, Flip’s\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
