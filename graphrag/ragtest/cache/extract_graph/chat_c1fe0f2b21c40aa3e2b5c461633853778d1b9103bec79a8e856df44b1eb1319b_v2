Let’s\nlook in more depth at their missions and the type of practices they regulate.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) Established by Congress in 1914 to oversee business, the\nFTC is the primary agency governing the advertising industry. Its main focus with respect to ad-\nvertising is to identify and eliminate ads that deceive or mislead the consumer. Some FTC re-\nsponsibilities include the following:\n• UnfairnessInitiate investigations against companies that engage in unfair competition or de-\nceptive practices.\n• DeceptionRegulate acts and practices that deceive businesses or consumers and issue cease-\nand-desist orders where such practices exist. Cease-and-desist orders require that the prac-\ntice be stopped within 30 days; an order given to one firm is applicable to all firms in the\nindustry.\n• ViolationsWhentheFTCfindsaviolationofthelaw,suchasadeceptiveorunfairprac-\ntice,itmandates(1)acease-and-desistorder,(2)anaffirmativedisclosure,or(3)corrective\nadvertising.\nSpecifically, the FTC oversees false advertising and in recent years that oversight has focused\non health and weight-loss business practices, 900 telephone numbers, telemarketing, and adver-\ntising that targets children and the elderly. The FTC hosts the National Do Not Call Registry to help\nCHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY 85\ncitizens keep from receiving unwanted telemarketing calls. The FTC monitors the ratings system\nand the advertising practices of the film, music, and electronic games industries. Periodically, it is-\nsues progress reports to Congress on youth-oriented entertainment advertising to make sure that\nads for products with potentially objectionable content—primarily violent or sexual content—are\nnot seen on media targeted to youth. The FTC’s reports to Congress cover advertising on televi-\nsion and websites as well as print media.\nThe existence of a regulatory agency such as the FTC influences advertisers’behavior. Al-\nthough most cases never reach the FTC, advertisers prefer not to risk long legal battles with the\nagency. Advertisers are also aware that competitors may complain to the FTC about a question-\nable advertisement. Such a move can cost the offending organization millions of dollars.\nThe FTC revised its guidelines governing testimonial advertisements, bloggers, and\ncelebrity endorsements in October 2009 for the first time since 1980. These guidelines toughen\nrules for endorsements and testimonials by requiring that the results touted by endorsers are likely\nto be typical. The revisions also now cover bloggers who must disclose any free products or other\ncompensation they get in exchange for their endorsements.34\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) The FDAis the regulatory division of the U.S. Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services that oversees package labeling, ingredient listings, and ad-\nvertising for food and drugs. It also determines the safety and purity of foods and cosmetics. In\nparticular, the FDAis a watchdog for drug advertising, specifically in the controversial area of\ndirect-to-consumer ads for prescription drugs. Its job is first to determine whether drugs are safe\nand then to see that these drugs are marketed in a responsible way. Marketing includes promo-\ntional materials aimed at doctors as well as consumers.\nFor pharmaceutical companies, advertising is a commercial free speech issue, and the in-\ndustry has brought pressure on the FDAto make direct-to-consumer advertising rules for pre-\nscription drugs more understandable, simpler, and clearer.\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC) The FCC, formed in 1934 to protect the public\ninterest in broadcast communication, can issue and revoke licenses to radio and television sta-\ntions. The FCC also has the power to ban messages, including ads, that are deceptive or in poor\ntaste. The agency monitors only advertisements that have been the subject of complaints and\nworks closely with the FTC to eliminate false and deceptive advertising. The FCC takes actions\nagainst the media, whereas the FTC is concerned with advertisers and agencies.\nOther Regulatory Bodies In addition to the FTC, the FDA, and the FCC, several other federal\nagencies regulate advertising. Most other federal agencies that regulate advertising are limited to\na certain type of advertising, product, or medium. We have already discussed the Patent Office\nand the Library of Congress and their roles in protecting copyrights and trademarks. Let’s now\nlook at other key regulatory agencies:\n• Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco,and FirearmsThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and\nFirearms (BATF) within the Treasury Department regulates deception in advertising and\nestablishes labeling requirements for the liquor industry. This agency’s power comes from\nits authority to issue and revoke annual operating permits for distillers, wine merchants,\nand brewers. Because there is a danger that public pressure could result in banning all ad-\nvertisements for alcoholic beverages, the liquor industry strives to maintain tight controls\non its advertising.\n• The U.S. Postal Service (USPS)The USPS regulates direct-mail and magazine advertising\nand has control over the areas of obscenity, lotteries, and fraud. To give you an idea of the\nmagnitude of the U.S. Postal Service’s responsibility, the Direct Marketing Association esti-\nmated spending on direct mail at $54 billion in 2008, even in a period of declining spending\non the medium.35Consumers who receive advertisements in the mail that they consider sex-\nually offensive can request that no more mail be delivered from that sender. The postmaster\ngeneral also has the power to withhold mail that promotes lotter\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
