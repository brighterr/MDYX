As we explained in Chapter 7, certain tools are better at delivering specific ob-\njectives. Table 18.1 provides a more extensive outline of the tools and their objectives. As you\nlook over the list, think about what’s required to launch a new product. In that situation, which\ntools would you select as the most appropriate?\nManaging 360-Degree Communication\nAnother lesson you may have learned from our previous discussions is that IMC is a philosophy,\na way of managing a brand with a singular vision of what the brand stands for. Unlike the short-\nterm IMC campaign approach, this is a philosophy that delivers total communication over the\nlife of a brand. We are calling this 360-degree communicationbecause a unifying brand vision\n548 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nTable 18.1 Typical Objectives for Various IMC Tools\nAdvertising Reach wide audience through mass media; acquire new customers; establish\nbrand image and personality; define brand position; identify points of differentiation and\ncompetitive advantage; counter competition; deliver reminders.\nPR Announce news; affect attitudes and opinions; maximize credibility and believability;\ngenerate likability; create and improve stakeholder relationships; stimulate buzz.\nConsumer Sales Promotion Stimulate behavior; generate immediate response; intensify\nneeds, wants, and motivations; reward behavior; stimulate improvement and relevance; create\npull through the channel; encourage repeat purchase.\nTrade Sales Promotion Build industry acceptance; push through the channel; motivate\ncooperation; energize sales force, dealers, and distributors.\nPoint of Purchase Increase immediate sales; attract attention at decision point; create interest;\nstimulate urgency; encourage trial and impulse purchasing.\nDirect Marketing Stimulate sales; create personal interest and relevance; provide information;\ncreate acceptance and conviction; encourage repeat purchase; maintain relationship.\nSponsorship and Events Build awareness; create brand experience; create opportunity for\nparticipation, interaction, and involvement; create excitement; stimulate buzz.\nPackaging Increase sales; attract attention at selection point; deliver product information;\ncreate brand reminder at point of purchase.\nSpecialties Reinforce brand identity; provide continuous brand reminder; reinforce\nsatisfaction; encourage repeat purchase.\nGuerilla Marketing Intercept prospects where they work, live, and visit; create curiosity and\nexcitement; provide opportunity for involvement; stimulate buzz.\nCustomer Service Answer questions; solve customer problems; record complaints and\ncompliments; turn bad customer experiences into positive experiences; listen to consumer\nperceptions and record feedback; notify appropriate departments of complaints and\ncompliments; test market communication strategies and copy points.\nsurrounds all the brand’s interactions with all its stakeholders—and this vision must be shared by\neveryone involved with the brand.\nAt this “total communication” level, a manager’s goal is to monitor all brand experiences to\nensure they are working together to support the brand vision. As we have said, messages are de-\nlivered by every element of the marketing mix, as well as every marcom message and every brand\nexperience at every brand contact point.\nThe problem is departmental siloswith each marcom function going its own way. The solu-\ntion according to the ANAreport cited earlier is “a team of colleagues who have the responsibil-\nity vision, understanding, and commitment to engage in a media-agnostic planning process.”3The\nonly way to monitor and plan for a diversity of brand communication is through cross-functional\nmanagement.Departmental silos that generate inconsistent messages is an organizational prob-\nlem and every department involved in delivering the brand message should be part of the team\nthat monitors and plans the brand communication. The point is that you can’t be integrated ex-\nternally if you are not integrated internally.\nNinth Principle of IMC\nNinth Principle of IMC\nA brand can’t be Abrand can’t be integrated externally if it is not integrated internally.\nintegrated externally if it is The importance of the need for a shared vision from a manager’s viewpoint was in evidence\nnot integrated internally. when the new chief executive at Ford realized that what the troubled car company needed after\nthe auto meltdown of the late 2000s was a unifying vision. To rally the troops, he had a motivat-\ning vision printed on laminated, wallet-size cards and given to the thousands of Ford employees.\nIt proclaimed: “One Ford . . . One Team . . . One Plan. . . . One Goal.” The statement conveyed a\nstrategy for returning Ford to its leadership position and undergirded the launch of the Ford Fo-\ncus, the firm’s first truly global car.4\nA Management Case Study On the big picture level, IMC is both a philosophy of management\nand a tool for creating and monitoring total brand communication. The best example comes from\nthe Tokyo-based Dentsu agency, which has aimed at providing total communication serviceto its\nclients for decades.5But until the 2000s, the agency was only able to do multimedia coordination\nCHAPTER 18 • THE IMC UMBRELLA 549\nat a one-voice, one-look level. New technology and a new management philosophy, however, cre-\nated a new way of doing business.\nTo truly operate with an IMC orientation, Dentsu underwent a total reorganization and de-\nsigned a comprehensive new IMC toolkit.
