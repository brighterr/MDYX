As\nyou recall, the media plan is a recommendation that the client must approve before any further\nsteps are taken. In fact, planning is only the first stage in advertising media operations. Once the\nplan directions are set, media buyers convert objectives and strategies into tactical decisions.\nThey select specific media vehicles and negotiate and contract for the time and space in media.\nIn this section we explain how the media buyer makes the media plan come to life. Amedia buyer\nhas distinct responsibilities as outlined in Figure 14.6.\nMedia Buying Complexities\nBuying is a complicated process. The American Association of Advertising Agencies lists no\nfewer than 21 elements of a media buy. The most important one, however, is matching the media\nvehicle to the strategic needs of the message and the brand. In this section, we examine the most\nimportant buyer activities: providing information to media planners, selecting the media vehicles,\nnegotiating costs, monitoring the media choices, evaluating the media choices after the campaign, Principle\nand handling billing and payment. Media buyers should\nbe consulted early in\n• Provide Inside InformationMedia buyers are important information sources for media plan-\nplanning as they are\nners. They are close enough to day-to-day changes in media popularity and pricing to be an a good source of\nimportant source of inside current information. For example, a newspaper buyer discovers information on changes\nthat a key newspaper’s delivery staff is going on strike, or a magazine buyer’s source reveals in media.\nFIGURE 14.6\n1. Provide The Functions of a Media\nInformation Buyer\nto Media\nPlanners\n6. Handle\nAll Billing 2. Select\nand Payment the Media\nMedia\nBuyer's\nFunctions\n5. Evaluate the 3.

Monitor\nthe Media\nPlan\nPerformance\n448 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nthat the new editor of a publication is going to change\nthe editorial focus dramatically. All of these things can\ninfluence the strategy and tactics of current and future\nadvertising plans.\n• Select Media VehiclesThe media planner determines\nthe media mix, but the buyer is responsible for choos-\ning the specific media vehicles. AMediaweekarticle,\nfor example, identifies patterns in media buyers’deci-\nsion making. Astudy reported in 2010 found that\nESPN was the top cable choice of media buyers, fol-\nlowed by Disney, TNT, TBS, the Food Network,\nUSA, HGTV, Comedy Central, and Bravo. In terms\nof buys on network TV, the study found that ABC\nwas best, followed by Fox, NBC, and CBS.14In terms\nof programs, American Idolhas been the most-\nwatched show on TVsince 2007, even though its\nnumbers started dropping in 2009. More than 25 mil-\nlion watched the show in 2009.15Online media buy-\ning is usually handled through ad networks and the\nbig portals. AOL, Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft are\nfour of the five biggest online ad networks; the\nMicrosoft Media Network is the fastest growing\nservice.16\nArmed with the media plan directives, the buyer\nseeks answers to a number of difficult questions as vari-\nous media vehicles are considered. Does the vehicle have\nThe physical characteristics of a magazine can affect its\nthe right audience profile? Will the program’s current\nability to deliver the desired message. For example, this\npopularity increase, stabilize, or decline? How well does\nV8 ad, which appeared in Reader’s Digest, uses simple\nthe magazine’s editorial format fit the brand and the mes-\nvisuals and minimal copy to accommodate the smaller\npage size. Reader’s Digestmay not be the best choice sage strategy (see the V8 ad example)? The answers to\nfor a complex ad. those questions bear directly on the campaign’s success.\n• NegotiateJust as a person buying a car often negotiates for the best price, so does a media\nbuyer negotiate for the best prices. The key questions are whether the desired vehicles are\navailable and whether a satisfactory schedule and rates can be negotiated. Aside from finding\nthe aperture of target audiences, nothing is more crucial in media buying than securing the\nlowest possible price for placements.\nEvery medium has a published rate card, but media buyers often negotiate special prices for\nvolume buys. The buyer must understand the trade-off between price received and audience ob-\njectives. For example, a media buyer might be able to get a lower price for 30 commercials on\nESPN, but part of the deal is that half the spots are scheduled with programs that don’t reach the\nprimary target audience. So the price may not be a good deal in the long run. Here are some other\nnegotiation considerations:\n• Bargain for Preferred PositionsMedia buyers must bargain for preferred positions,the lo-\ncations in magazines and other print media that offer readership advantages (see Chapter 12).\nImagine the value a food advertiser would gain from having its message located in a special\nrecipe section that the homemaker can detach from the magazines for permanent use. How\nmany additional exposures might that ad get? Because they are so visible, preferred posi-\ntions often carry a premium sur\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
