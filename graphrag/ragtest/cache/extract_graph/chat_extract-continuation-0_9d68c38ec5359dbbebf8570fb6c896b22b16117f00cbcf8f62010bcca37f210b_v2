Companies that need closer control over their advertising have their own\nCHAPTER 1 • THE NEW WORLD OF MARKETING COMMUNICATION 23\ninternal in-house agencies. An in-house agency performs most, and sometimes all, of the func-\ntions of an outside advertising agency and produce materials, such as point-of-sale displays, sales\nteam literature, localized ads and promotions, and coupon books, that larger agencies have a hard\ntime producing cost effectively. Retailers, for example, find that doing their own advertising and\nmedia placement provides cost savings, as well as the ability to meet fast-breaking deadlines.\nSome fashion companies, such as Ralph Lauren, also create their own advertising in house to\nmaintain complete control over the brand image and the fashion statement it makes. Check out\nthis in-house agency at http://about.ralphlauren.com/campaigns/default.asp.\nSpecialized Agencies Many agencies do not follow the traditional full-service agency approach.\nThey either specialize in certain functions (writing copy, producing art, or media buying), audi-\nences (minority, youth), industries (health care, computers, agriculture, business-to-business\ncommunication), or markets (minority groups such as Asian, African American, or Hispanic). In\naddition, some agencies specialize in other marketing communication areas, such as branding, di-\nrect marketing, sales promotion, public relations, events and sports marketing, packaging, and\npoint-of-sale promotions. Sometimes one-client agencies are created to handle the work of one\nlarge client. Let’s take a look at two special types of agencies:\n• Creative boutiquesare ad agencies, usually small (two or three people to a dozen or more),\nthat concentrate entirely on preparing the creative execution of the idea, or the creative prod-\nuct. Acreative boutique has one or more writers or artists on staff, but generally no staff for\nmedia, research, or strategic planning. Typically, these agencies can prepare advertising to\nrun in print and broadcast media, as well as in out-of-home (such as outdoor and transit ad-\nvertising), Internet, and alternative media. Creative boutiques usually serve companies di-\nrectly, but are sometimes retained by full-service agencies that are overloaded with work.\n• Media-buying servicesspecialize in the purchase of media for clients. They are in high de-\nmand for many reasons, but three reasons stand out. First, media has become more complex\nas the number of choices has grown—think of the proliferation of new cable channels, mag-\nazines, and radio stations. Second, the cost of maintaining a competent media department\nhas escalated. Third, media-buying services often buy media at a low cost because they can\ngroup several clients’purchases together to get discounts from the media because of the vol-\nume of their media buys.\nAgency Networks and Holding Companies Finally let’s talk about agency networks,which are\nlarge conglomerations of agencies under a central ownership. Agency networks are all of the of-\nfices that operate under one agency name, such as DDB Worldwide (200 offices in 90 countries)\nor BBDO Worldwide (287 offices in 79 countries). You can read more about these agencies and\ntheir networks at www.ddb.comandwww.bbdoworldwide.com.\nHolding companiesinclude one or more advertising agency networks, as well as other types\nof marketing communication agencies and marketing services consulting firms. The four largest\nare WPPGroup, Interpublic, Omnicom, and Publicis. WPP, for example, includes the J. Walter\nThompson Group, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, Young & Rubicam, Grey Global Group, and\nBates advertising networks, as well as the Berlin Cameron creative agency, public relations agen-\ncies Hill and Knowlton, Ogilvy Public Relations, and Burson-Marsteller; direct-response com-\npany Wunderman; research firms Millward Brown and Research International; media firms\nMindshare and Mediaedge:cia; and branding and corporate identity firms Landor and Lambie-\nNaim, to name a few. Most of those firms are also networks with multiple offices. For an inside\nlook at a big holding company, check out WPPat www.wpp.com.\nHow Are Agency Jobs Organized?\nIn addition to the chief executive officer, if the agency is large enough, it usually has one or more\nvice presidents, as well as department heads for the different functional areas. We will concen-\ntrate on five of those areas: account management; account planning and research; creative devel-\nopment and production; media research, planning, and buying; and internal services.\nAccount Management The account management (sometimes called account services) func-\ntionactsasaliaisonbetweentheclientandtheagency.Itensuresthattheagencyfocusesitsre-\nsourcesontheclient’sneeds.Theaccountteamsummarizestheclient’scommunicationneedsand\n24 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\ndevelopsthebasic“chargetotheagency,”whichtheaccountmanagerpresentstotheagency’s\nteam.
