The working arrange-\nment between advertiser and agency is known as the agency–client partnership.Both the “1984”\nstory and the BK deprivation scheme demonstrated how important it is to cultivate a strong sense\nof trust between the agency and its clients because these were both risky ideas.\nAn advertiser uses an outside agency because it believes the agency will be more efficient in\ncreating advertising messages than the advertiser would be on its own. Successful agencies such\nas Crispin Porter (cid:2) Bogusky typically have strategic and creative expertise, media knowledge,\nworkforce talent, and the ability to negotiate good deals for clients. The advertising professionals\nworking for the agency are experts in their areas of specialization and passionate about their work.\nNot all advertising professionals work in agencies. Large advertisers, either companies or\norganizations, manage the advertising process either by setting up an advertising department\n(sometimes called marketing services) that oversees the work of agencies or by setting up their\nown in-house agency, as we see in Figure 1.3. Tasks performed by the company’s marketing ser-\nvices department include the following: select the agencies; coordinate activities with vendors,\nsuch as media, production, and photography; make sure the work gets done as scheduled; and de-\ntermine whether the work has achieved prescribed objectives.\nThe Media The third player in the advertising world is the media.
