To understand the role of trade promotion, consider how sales pro-\nmotion is used in push-and-pull strategies. Consumer and trade promotions interact through\n530 PART 5 â€¢ PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\ncomplementing push-and-pull strategies. If people really want to try King Corn based on what\nPrinciple\nthey have heard in advertising and publicity stories, they will ask their local retailers for it, which\nConsumer and trade\npromotions interact is called a pull strategy;that is, by asking for it, they will pull the product through the distribu-\nthrough complementing tion channel. Sometimes the advertising and publicity are focused on a sales promotion, which\npush-and-pull strategies. can be used to intensify demand for the product. By conducting a contest in conjunction with\nsampling, for example, we can increase the pull of a promotion at the same time we get people\nto try the new product.\nHowever, you might use a push strategy to push the product through the channel by con-\nvincing (motivating or rewarding) members of the distribution network to carry King Corn. For\nexample, we want grocery stores not only to carry them, but also to allocate good shelf space in\nthe crowded chip aisle. Here are the most common types of incentives and trade deals used with\nretailers as part of a push strategy:\nâ€¢ BonusesAmonetary bonus, also called push moneyorspiffs,is paid to a salesperson based\non units the salesperson sells over a period of time. For example, an air conditioner manu-\nfacturer might give salespeople a $50 bonus for the sale of one model and $75 for a fancier\nmodel, within a certain time frame. At the end of the sales period, each salesperson sends in\nevidence of total sales to the manufacturer and receives a check for the bonus amount.\nâ€¢ Dealer LoaderThese are premiums, comparable to a consumer premium, that a manufac-\nturer gives to a retailer for buying a certain amount of a product. Abuying loader rewards re-\ntailers for buying the product. Budweiser offered store managers a free trip to the Super\nBowl if they sold a certain amount of beer in a specified period of time. Display loaders re-\nward retailers by giving them the display after the promotion ends. For example, Dr. Pepper\nbuilt a store display for the July 4th holiday that included a gas grill, picnic table, basket,\nand other items. The store manager was awarded these items after the promotion ended.\nâ€¢ Buying AllowancesAmanufacturer pays a reseller a set amount of money or offers a dis-\ncount for purchasing a certain amount of the product during a specified time period.\nâ€¢ Advertising AllowancesThe manufacturer pays the wholesaler or retailer a certain amount\nof money to advertise the manufacturerâ€™s product. This allowance can be a flat dollar\namount, or it can be a percentage of gross purchases during a specified time period.\nâ€¢ Co-op AdvertisingIn a contractual arrangement between the manufacturer and the resellers,\nthe manufacturer agrees to pay a part or all of the retailersâ€™advertising expenses.\nâ€¢ Display AllowanceAdirect payment of cash or goods is given to the retailer if the retailer\nagrees to set up the point-of-sale display.\nAttention Some trade promotions are designed to get the attention of both trade members and\ntheir customers. PoPdisplays, a promotional tool we mentioned earlier, are designed to get the\nattention of shoppers when they are in the store and to stimulate impulse purchases. They are used\nby retailers, but provided by manufacturers. As we have moved to a self-service retail environ-\nment in which fewer and fewer customers expect help from sales clerks, the importance of PoP\nmaterials continues to increase. POPAI has found that the PoPforms that have the greatest im-\npact on sales are displays that tie in with entertainment, sports, or charities.\nIn the Practical Tipsfeature, marketing consultant Arlene Gerwin explains how best to plan\neffective PoPpromotions.\nIn addition to getting attention in crowded aisles and promoting impulse purchases, mar-\nketers are designing PoPefforts to complement other promotional campaigns. As part of getting\nattention, retailers appreciate PoPideas that build store ambience. Club Med designed a floor dis-\nplay for travel agents that featured a beach chair with a surfboard on one side and a pair of skis\non the other to show that Club Med has both snow and sun destinations. Advertisers must design\nPoPdisplays that appeal to both end users and the trade. Retailers will use a PoPonly if they are\nconvinced that it will generate greater sales.\nMotivation Most trade promotions are designed to, in some way, motivate trade members to co-\noperate with the manufacturerâ€™s promotion. Incentives such as contests and trade deals are used.\nIf conducted properly with a highly motivating incentive or prize, contests can spur short-term\nsales and improve the relationship between the manufacturer and the reseller. They encourage a\nhigher quantity of purchases and create enthusiasm among trade members who are involved with\nCHAPTER 17 â€¢ PROMOTIONS 531\nPRACTICAL TIPS\nPlanning Point-of-Purchase Promotions\nArlene Gerwin,Marketing Consultant and President, Bolder Insights\nEver since retail establishments came â€¢ BridgePoP displays serve as a bridge linking trade\ninto existence, there has been and consumer promotions.
