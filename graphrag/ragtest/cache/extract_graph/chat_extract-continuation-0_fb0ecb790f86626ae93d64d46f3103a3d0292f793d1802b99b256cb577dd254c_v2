What are the effects that determine\nwhether an advertisement works or not? Over the years, professionals have used several models\nto outline what they believe is the impact of an advertisement on its audience:8\n• AIDAThe most commonly used explanation of how advertising works is referred to as\nAIDA,which stands for attention,interest,desire, and action. This concept was first ex-\npressed around 1900 by an advertising pioneer named St. Elmo Lewis. Because AIDAas-\nsumes a predictable set of steps, it also is referred to as a hierarchy of effectsmodel.\nNumerous other hierarchical models have been developed over the years to help advertisers\nplan their advertising.9\n• Think/Feel/DoAnother relatively simple answer to how advertising works is the think/feel/do\nmodeldeveloped in the 1970s. Also referred to as the FCB modelin honor of the agency\nwhere it was developed as a strategic planning tool, the idea is that advertising motivates peo-\nple to think about the message, feel something about the brand, and then do something, such as\ntry it or buy it.10That view is supported by recent research by Nyilasy and Reid into what pro-\nfessionals in advertising know and believe about how advertising works. Their in-depth inter-\nviews found that “agency practitioners strongly believe that exposure to ads causes changes in\nhuman cognition, emotions, and behavior”—or think/feel/do.11\n• DomainsAdifferent approach that attempted to solve the problem of linear steps is found in\nMoriarty’s domains model. It is based on the idea that messages have an impact on con-\nsumer responses, not in steps, but simultaneously. The three key effects, or domains, identi-\nfied in this approach are (1) perception, (2) learning, and (3) persuasion. The idea is that a\nmessage can engage consumers’perceptions (attention, interest), educate them (think, learn),\nand persuade them (change attitude and behavior) all at the same time.12The Port of Van-\ncouver ads are an example of how these effects interact. Even though the ads are in the\nbusiness-to-business (B2B) category, the ads get the attention of their audience with dra-\nmatic headlines and visuals: “We have room to fulfill your vision” and the “Vacancy” sign,\nfor example. The “Vacancy” ad is an educational message as the rest of the headline explains\n(“858 acres to be exact”), but also persuasive in that it makes the argument that the Port of\nVancouver has room to grow and provide space to meet the needs of its customers.\nHow do we make sense of all of these ideas about how advertising works in order to create\na reasonable approach to use in planning and critiquing advertising? One goal of this book is to\norganize all of these effects so they are useful for setting objectives and, ultimately, evaluating ef-\nfectiveness. But how to do it? That’s the question at the heart of this chapter and we’ll answer\nwith our model of how advertising and marketing communication work, a model that we think\nyou will find to be simple and easy to use in explaining the impact of a message.\nWhat Effects Are Critical?\nAdvertising professionals learn from their experiences producing marketing communication that\nworks—and sometimes doesn’t work very well. The practitioners interviewed by Nyilasy and\nReid identified four building blocks as essential to effective advertising. They are attention, brand\nawareness, attitudes, and behavioral responses.13\nAttitudes are both rational and emotional. The rational element is confirmed by David Ogilvy,\nwho says in his classic little book, Confessions of an Advertising Man,“Very few advertisements\ncontain enough factual information to sell the product.” He was also quoted on the Advertising Hall\nof Fame website as saying that it needs to be informative to be persuasive.14\n104 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nRRRRRRRiiiivvvveeeerrrr LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL\nRRRRaaaiiiilll\nRRRRooooaaaadddd\nUnlike other ports, the Port of Vancouver has room developed along with our already\nto grow.
