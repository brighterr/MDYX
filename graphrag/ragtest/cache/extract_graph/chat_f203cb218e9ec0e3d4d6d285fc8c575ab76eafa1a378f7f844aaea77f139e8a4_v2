With this brief introduction to the basics of marketing com-\nmunication media, as well as the new and nontraditional forms of media, we turn now in the next\nchapter to a review of traditional media—print, outdoor, and broadcast—and the characteristics\nthat make them different from other media forms.\nCHAPTER 11 • MEDIA BASICS 349\nIT’S A WRAP\nAxe Cleans Up\nAs you read throughout this chapter, reaching consumers in a complex and rapidly changing media envi-\nronment challenges advertisers to think creatively. Those who will be successful in advertising break\nthrough the clutter and deliver messages that are relevant to the consumer. The Axe campaigns you read\nabout in the case opener, “How Dirty Boys Get Clean” and “Axe Detailer: The Manly Shower Tool,” demon-\nstrate how marketing contributed to making Axe the top male shower brand in the United States.\nAfter the Detailer was introduced, sales exceeded expectations. For example, the number of units sold\nper Walmart store per week more than doubled that of other shower gel products. The campaign was so suc-\ncessful, many stores had trouble keeping Axe Shower Gel on the shelves. Share of market increased as well,\npeaking with the communication activity. Tracking studies indicated that the Detailer campaign achieved the\ngoals of communicating the correct branding and teaching something about the product.\nDemonstrating another way to clean up, Axe has won many advertising awards, including an Effie and\ntwo Bronze Lions from the Cannes International Advertising Festival.\nIf you read “The Animated Axe Effect in City Hunters” in this chapter you realized that Axe is a global\nbrand. You read about Axe’s efforts to create branded entertainment. Other award-winning work is occurring\nacross the globe. Mindshare won “best localization” for its multinational work at the Valencia Festival of Me-\ndia in Spain for a campaign that centered around the concept that “men should be as irresistible as choco-\nlate” to women. To give you an idea about how this worked, French girls gave guys “nibbles and licks” on a\nsocial networking site, while in Belgium, luxury chocolate love tokens were distributed. Portuguese guys were\ncoaxed into buying chocolate, seducing girls, and possibly winning a visit to the Chocolate Pleasure Mansion.\nThese sparkling efforts show the extent to which creative ideas can be applied to a variety of media and con-\ntexts, all to achieve the same effect—to sell the product.\nKey Points Summary\n1.How do media work in marketing communication and dia are strategically combined in an advertising plan.
