In the\nfirst, the rational view, advertising is seen as a vehicle for helping consumers assess value through\nprice cues and other information, such as quality, location, and reputation. Advocates of this view-\npoint see the role of advertising as a means to objectively provide price/value information,\nthereby creating more rational economic decisions. By focusing on images and emotional re-\nsponses, the second approach appeals to consumers making a decision on nonprice, emotional\nappeals. This emotional view explains how images and psychological appeals influence con-\nsumer decisions. This type of advertising is believed to be so persuasive that it decreases the like-\nlihood a consumer will switch to an alternative product, regardless of the price charged.\nIn addition to informing us about new and improved products, advertising also mirrors fash-\nion and design trends and adds to our aesthetic sense. Advertising has an educational role in that\nit teaches about new products and their use. It may also expose social issues—some say the\n“1984” commercial symbolically proclaimed the value of computer literacy “for the rest of us,”\nthose who weren’t slaves to the hard-to-operate PC systems of the time. It helps us shape an im-\nage of ourselves by setting up role models with which we can identify (a woman athlete liberat-\ning the gray masses), and it gives us a way to express ourselves in terms of our personalities\n(smash the screen image of Big Brother) and sense of style (red shorts—the only color in the drab\nenvironment) through the things we wear and use. It also presents images capturing the diversity\nof the world in which we live. These social roles have both negative and positive dimensions,\nwhich we will discuss in Chapter 3.\nWhat Are the Most Common Types of Advertising?\nThere isn’t just one kind of advertising. In fact, advertising is a large and varied industry. Differ-\nent types of advertising have different roles. Considering all the different advertising situations,\nwe can identify seven major types of advertising:\n1. Brandadvertising,themostvisibletypeofadvertising,isreferredtoasnationalor\nconsumeradvertising.Brandadvertising,suchasthatfortheAppleMacintoshintheclassic\n“1984”commercial,focusesonthedevelopmentofalong-termbrandidentityandimage.\n2.

J.Maxx,oramanufacturerordistributorwhooffersproductsinafairlyrestrictedgeo-\ngraphicarea.\n3. Direct-response advertisingtries to stimulate an immediate response by the customer to\nthe seller. It can use any advertising medium, particularly direct mail and the Internet. The\nconsumer can respond by telephone, mail, or over the Internet, and the product is delivered\ndirectly to the consumer by mail or some other carrier.\n4. Business-to-business (B2B) advertising,also called trade advertising,is sent from one\nbusiness to another. It includes messages directed at companies distributing products as\nwell as industrial purchasers and professionals such as lawyers and physicians. Advertisers\nplace most business advertising in professional publications.\n5.
