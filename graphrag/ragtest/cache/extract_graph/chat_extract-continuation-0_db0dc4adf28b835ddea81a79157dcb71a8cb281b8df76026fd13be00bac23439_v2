That’s why copywriters think carefully about playing loose with the language even if it\nsounds right.3\nIn contrast to the good practices in copywriting we’ve been describing, there are also some\nthings to avoid. Meaningless words (really,very,that,a lot) or words made meaningless by over-\nuse (free,guarantee,opportunity) are to be shunned in business writing and advertising accord-\ning to a feature on advertising writing on MSNBC.4\nFormulaic advertising copy is one problem that is so obvious that comedians parody it. This\ntype of formula writing, called adese,violates all the guidelines for writing effective copy that\nwe’ve been describing. It is full of clichés (as easy as pie), superlatives and puffery (best in class),\nstock phrases (buy now; free trial offer), and vague generalities (prices too low to advertise). For\nexample, consider this copy; can you hear yourself saying something like this to a friend?\nNow we offer the quality that you’ve been waiting for—at a price you can afford. So buy\nnow and save.\nFor more advertising clichés, check this website: www.the-top-tens.com/lists/most-overused-\nadvertising-cliches.asp.\nThe pompous overblown phrasing of many corporate statements doesn’t work—it doesn’t\nget attention; it’s not memorable; it doesn’t get read. We call it your-name-here copybecause al-\nmost any company can use those words and tack a signature on the end. For example, a broad-\nband company named Covad started off an ad like this:\nOpportunity. Potential. These are terms usually associated with companies that have a\nlot to prove and little to show for it. But on rare occasion,opportunity can be used to\ndescribe a company that has already laid the groundwork,made the investments,and\nis well down the road to strong growth.\nIt’s all just platitudes and clichés—and any company could use this copy. It isn’t attention\ngetting and it doesn’t contribute to a distinctive and memorable brand image. That’s always a risk\nwith company-centered copy, which doesn’t say anything that relates to the customer’s needs,\nwants, and interests. It just doesn’t work.\nAnother type of adese is brag-and-boast copy,which is “we” copy written from the com-\npany’s point of view with a pompous tone, similar to the Covad ad. Consider a print ad by Buick.\nThe ad starts with the stock opening, “Introducing Buick on the move.” The body copy includes\nsuperlatives and generalities such as “Nothing less than the expression of a new philosophy,” “It\nstrikes a new balance between luxury and performance—a balance which has been put to the\ntest,” and “Manufactured with a degree of precision that is in itself a breakthrough.” Because peo-\nple are so conditioned to screen out advertising, messages that use this predictable style are easy\nto ignore—or parody if you’re a comedian.\nThe Strategy Imperative We said in the beginning of this chapter that the creative team begins\nwith the strategy statement from the client or the creative brief from agency planners. That means\neven beautiful writing has to also make the strategy sing. As Susan Gunelius, author of Kick-Ass\nCopywriting in 10 Easy Stepsexplains, “Copywriting is about creating perceived needs among a\nspecific audience.”5If it doesn’t move the audience and deliver on the objectives, then it’s not ef-\nfective copywriting.\nFurthermore, the writing not only has to be strategic, the claims also have to be tested and\nmeet basic requirements of truth, as the A Principled Practicefeature explains.\nHOW IS COPY CREATED FOR PRINT?\nAprint piece, such as an advertisement or brochure, is created in two pieces: a copy sheet and a\nlayout. Even though they work together to create a creative concept, we’ll discuss copy in this\nchapter and layout in the next chapter.\nThe two categories of copy that print uses are display copy and body copy (or text). Display\ncopyincludes all elements that readers see in their initial scanning. These elements—headlines,\nsubheads, call-outs, taglines, and slogans—usually are set in larger type sizes than body copy and\nare designed to get attention and to stop the viewer’s scanning. Body copyincludes the elements\nthat are designed to be read and absorbed, such as the text of the ad message and captions.\n266 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nA PRINCIPLED PRACTICE\nCheck Those Claims\nYou should be able to believe the advertising from 11 percent had an improvement of 20 percent in their\ntrusted major brands such as General Mills and attentiveness.
