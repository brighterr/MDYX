The message is decoded, or interpreted, by the receiver(R), who is the reader, viewer, or lis-\ntener. Feedbackis obtained by monitoring the response of the receiver to the message. The en-\ntire process is complicated by what we refer to as noise, things that interrupt the sending and\nreceiving of the message, such as a bad connection or words with unclear meanings.\nAdvertising as Mass Communication\nTo translate the SMCR model to advertising using the Ford SYNC example, consider that the source\ntypically is the advertiser (Ford) assisted by its agency (Zubi) who encodes the information—that\nis, advertising professionals turn the marketer’s information (voice-recognition technology) into an\ninteresting and attention-getting message (SYNC: At Your Command—a message delivered\nthrough music by spokesperson Juanes). Together they determine the objectivesfor the message—\nan advertisement or campaign—in terms of the effects they want the message to have on the\nconsumer audience(receiver).If the communication process fails to work and the consumer does\nnot receive the message as intended by the advertiser, then the communication effort is ineffective.\nThe advertising communication model shown in Figure 4.1b describes how this communication\nprocess works.\nFIGURE 4.1B\nNoise: External\nAn Advertising Public Opinion\nCommunication Model Marketing Strategy\nCompetition\nOther Noise Receiver: Consumer\nReception and Response\nPerceive\nSource: Message: Media Mix:\nUnderstand\nAdvertiser Encoding Channels\nFeel\n(objectives) (by Agency)\nConnect\nBelieve\nAct\nNoise: Internal\nPerceived Needs\nInformation Processing\nAttitudes and Opinions\nOther Noise\nFeedback\nCHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 101\nThemessage,of course, is the advertisement or other marketing communication, such as a press\nrelease, store banner, brochure, video, or Web page. The message may be spelled out in the words,\nbut in most advertising the visual elements also carry meaning. In fact, some advertising messages,\nsuch as the 1984 commercial for the Macintosh discussed in Chapter 1, are primarily visual.\nThemedium(channel) is the vehicle that delivers the message (TVcommercials, website,\nflyers, Twitter tweets, events, in-store displays). In advertising, that tends to be newspapers and\nmagazines in print, radio and TVin broadcasting, the Internet, and other forms of out-of-home\nvehicles, such as outdoor boards and posters. Other media include the phone, fax, specialty items\n(mugs, T-shirts), in-store signs, brochures, catalogs, shopping bags, inflatables, even sidewalks\nand toilet doors. The latest entry in the medium of marketing communication is the cell phone,\nwhich has become a major personal communication technology. With instant messaging,\npodcasting,movie downloads, photo transmission, Web surfing and tweeting, the cell phone is\nthe newest “must-have” communication device.\nExternal noise,which hinders the consumer’s reception of the message, includes technical\nand socioeconomic trends that affect the reception of the message, like the economic downturn.\nHealth trends, for example, often harm the reception of fast-food messages. Problems with the\nbrand’s marketing mix (product design, price, distribution, and marketing communication) can\nalso have an impact on the consumer’s response.\nExternal noise can also be related to the advertising media. It can be as simple as bad broad-\ncast or cell phone reception. Amore likely cause of noise is clutter,which is the multitude of mes-\nsages all competing to get consumers’ attention. More specifically, clutter is all the ads in a\nmagazine or newspaper, or all the commercials you see on television when watching a program\nor listening to your favorite radio station. It can even include any of the 3,000 or so commercial\nmessages you see in your daily environment, such as outdoor boards and brand names on T-shirts,\nas well as in unexpected places, such as painted messages on sidewalks.\nInternal noiseincludes personal factors that affect the reception of an advertisement, such\nas the receiver’s needs, language skills, purchase history, information-processing abilities, and\nother personal factors. If you are too tired to listen or your attention is focused elsewhere, then\nyour fatigue or disinterest creates noise that hinders your reception of the message. Distraction\nfrom competing brand messages can also create internal noise, such as doubt or confusion.\nFeedbackis the reaction the audience has to a message. It can be obtained through research\nor through customer-initiated contact with the company, which are important tests of the effec-\ntiveness of marketing communication messages.\nThe end point of the communication process is the receiver,or in advertising terms the con-\nsumers who make up the audience. How the consumer responds to the message determines the\neffectiveness of the advertising. Consumer response is the focus of the rest of this chapter.\nAreally important thing to remember is that this process is not foolproof or even depend-\nable. You can’t be sure the receiver will understand and interpret your message as you intended.\nRemember the childhood “telephone” game where you stand in a circle and whisper a message\nfrom person to person—and the last message rarely comes out sounding like the initial message.\nThat’s why feedback research is so important in marketing communication.\nAdding Interaction to Marketing Communication\nMass communication is traditionally seen as a one-way communicationprocess with the message\ndepicted, as in Figures 4.1aand b, as moving from the source to the receiver—from an advertiser\nto a target audience. However, interactive communicationsuch as Ogilvy’s idea of advertising\nas personal conversation, is two-way communication—a dialogue or conversation—and market-\ning communication is moving in that direction.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
