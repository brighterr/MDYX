If the\namount of time to cover is limited, advertising can be concentrated more heavily. Message\nscheduling is driven by use cycles. For products that are consumed year-round, such as fast food\nand movies, advertising is spread throughout the year. In general, if you cannot cover the whole\nyear, you should heavy up the schedule in higher purchase periods. For example, movie mar-\nketers do most of their newspaper advertising on the weekends, when most people go to movies.\nAnother question is how much is enough. At what point does the message make its\npoint? If the advertising period is too short or there are too few repetitions, then the message\nmay have little or no impact. If the period is too long, then ads may suffer from wearout,\nwhich means the audience gets tired of them and stops paying attention.\n• Continuity:HowOften?Continuityreferstothewaytheadvertisingisspreadoverthe\nlengthofacampaign.Acontinuousstrategyspreadstheadvertisingevenlyoverthe\ncampaignperiod.Twoothermethodstoconsider,pulsingandflighting,areshownin\nFigure14.4.\nApulsing strategyis used to intensify advertising before a buying aperture and then to re-\nduce advertising to lower levels until the aperture reopens. The pulse pattern has peaks and val-\nleys, also called bursts. Fast-food companies such as McDonald’s and Burger King often use\npulsing patterns as they increase media weight during special promotional pe-\nPulsing Option riods. Although the competition for daily customers suggests continuous ad-\nvertising, they will greatly intensify activity to accommodate special events\nsuch as new menu items, merchandise premiums, and contests. Pulsed sched-\nules cover most of the year, but still provide periodic intensity.\nAfter a media schedule has been worked out in terms of what media will\nrun when and for how long, these decisions are plotted on a media flow chart.\nAcross the top is the calendar for the period of the campaign and down the side\nis the list of media to be used in this campaign. Bars are then drawn across the\nCampaign Time\ncalendar that identify the exact timing of the use of various media. When the\nchart is complete, strategies such as pulsing and flighting are easy to observe.\nYou can also see where reminder advertising in less expensive media (in-store\nsigns) may fill in between bursts and pulsing in more expensive media such as\ntelevision. You can see a flow chart in the media plan example that follows later\nin the chapter.\nAflighting strategyis the most severe type of continuity adjustment. It is\ncharacterized by alternating periods of intense advertising activity and periods\nof no advertising, called a hiatus. This on-and-off schedule allows for a longer\ncampaign. The hope in using nonadvertising periods is that the consumers will\nremember the brand and its advertising for some time after the ads have\nFIGURE 14.4 stopped. Figure 14.5illustrates this awareness change. The jagged line repre-\nThe Strategies of Pulsing and Flighting sents the rise and fall of consumer awareness of the brand. If the flighting strat-\negy works, there will be a carryover effectof past advertising, which means\nconsumers will remember the product across the gap un-\ntil the next advertising period begins. The critical decision\ninvolves analyzing the decay level, the rate at which\nmemory of the advertising is forgotten.\nSize and Position Strategies In addition to selecting\nthe media mix, a media planner works with the creative\nteam to determine the appropriate size and length of the\nmessage for each medium. This question of scope and\nscale applies to all media—even transit advertising, as\nthe Yellow Cab ad illustrates.\ntnepS\n$\nFlighting Option\nCampaign Time\ntnepS\n$\nAwareness Level\nCampaign Time\nFIGURE 14.5\nConsumer Awareness Levels in a Flighting Strategy\ntnepS\n$\nCHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 435\nMedia Weighting Media planners often use decision\ncriterion called weighting to help them decide how\nmuch to budget (we have referred to this as “heavy\nup”) in each DMAor region and for each target audi-\nence when there is more than one. For example, if a\nmedia planner is advertising disposable contact lenses,\nthere might be two target segments to consider: con-\nsumers who need help with their eyesight and the eye\ndoctors who make the recommendations. You may re-\ncall the discussion of push and pull strategies in\nChapter 2, which is also relevant here. If the strategy is\nto encourage the consumer to ask the doctor about the\nproduct, the planner might recommend putting more\nemphasis on consumer publications to execute a pull\nstrategyrather than focusing on professional journals\nfor eye doctors, which would represent a push strat-\negy.Aweighting strategy might be to put 60 percent of\nthe budget on consumers and 40 percent on doctors.\nIn the case of DMAs, weak markets may be given\nmore than their share of media weight in the hopes of\nstrengthening the brands in these markets, a practice\nknown as investment spending. On the other hand, if\ncompetition is extremely heavy in a brand’s strong This photo illustrates the use of transit advertising—in this case a\nmarkets, the strategy may be to give them more than panel on the top of a taxi—to advertise the Wall Street Journal.\ntheir proportional share of media dollars to defend The media plan would give direction to the decisions about the\nagainst competitors.
