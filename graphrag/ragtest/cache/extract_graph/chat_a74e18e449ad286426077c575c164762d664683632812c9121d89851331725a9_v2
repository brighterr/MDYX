But it would be misplaced\ncommercials. Since the Advertising Council and trust in the power of mass communication to think\nother groups depend on time or space donated by that advertising alone is the solution.\nCorporate Advertising With corporate advertising,a company focuses on its corporate im-\nage or viewpoint. There is less emphasis on selling a particular product unless it is tied in to a\ngood cause. For that reason, the ad or other campaign materials may originate in the public rela-\ntions department rather than the advertising department.\nAn example of corporate advertising that is tied to a socially redeeming program is the Tar-\nget Guest Card. To increase use of the credit card, the Martin/Williams agency of Minneapolis\nhad to find a compelling reason for people to shop at Target and use the card. Target’s typical cus-\ntomer is female, ages 25 to 54, and her most important concern is her family. The agency team\nproposed a “Take Charge of Education” campaign, a simple fund-raising program for local\nschools tied to use of the Target Guest Card. One percent of the value of the purchases made with\nthe card would go to a qualifying K–12 school of the cardholder’s choice. The fund-raising pro-\ngram for schools showcases Target’s commitment to education, an area of great importance to\nTarget customers. So far Target has given more than $273 million to schools.26It gives 5 percent\nof its income—$3 million—to communities every week.\nCorporate identity advertisingis another type of advertising that firms use to enhance or\nmaintain their reputation among specific audiences or to establish a level of awareness of the com-\npany’s name and the nature of its business. “The Johnson & Johnson Campaign for Nursing’s\n474 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nFuture” celebrates the profession and helps recruit and retain nurses in one of\nits initiatives. Companies that have changed their names, such as Accenture\n(formerly Andersen Consulting), have also used corporate identity advertising.\nSometimes companies deliver point-of-view messages called advocacy\nadvertising. General Electric’s Ecomagination campaign that we mentioned\nbefore, for example, shows that the company wants to be a caretaker of the en-\nvironment and is creating products in line with that philosophy. Another ex-\nample comes from Procter & Gamble. Following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil\nspill P&G recognized that many animals are injured or killed by the 24 million\ngallons of oil that typically pollute North American waters each year. In re-\nsponse it created a campaign for Dawn liquid dishwashing detergent .
