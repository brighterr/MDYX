This data miningpractice, which enables advertisers to direct\nhighly tailored marketing messages to narrow slices of a segment, was refined for George Bush’s\n2004 reelection campaign and used again in the midterm elections by California Governor Arnold\nSchwarzenegger, as well as other candidates, both Democrat and Republican, in the 2008 elec-\ntion. From these data banks, political experts can tell what car or cars likely voters will drive, as\nwell as their choices in recreation, leisure time activities, and restaurants.\nMicrotargeting has applications beyond politics. Several marketers have been able to profile\nprospects by carefully analyzing data on their regular customers to identify these revealing ten-\ndencies and characteristics.\nBut sometimes it doesn’t work. An example of what sounded like a good idea at microtarget-\ning comes from Chevrolet’s “Come Together and Worship,” a 16-concert tour with top Christian-\nmusic performers.
