It can make you laugh,\nor squirm in your seat, or bring tears to your eyes. It can inspire you to read about a new\nproduct or remember a favorite brand when you’re walking down the aisle in a super-\nmarket. Advertising can also leave you free to change the channel or turn a page without\nbeing aware of having seen the brand message at all. So the question for you as a student\nof marketing communication is: Did it work?\nBut you’re not the only one facing that question. It’s clear from the headlines in in-\ndustry publications that marketers want to know if their ads and other marketing commu-\nnication efforts work. Marketing communication, particularly advertising, costs money—a\nlot of money in many cases—and marketers want proof that their advertising and market-\ning communication is efficient and effective.\nThat’s why this textbook, Advertising & IMC:Principles & Practice,is dedicated not\nonly to explaining advertising and other areas of brand communication—such as public re-\nlations, direct marketing, and sales promotion—but also to investigating what makes mar-\nketing communication effective.\nThechallengeforthisNinthEditionistopindownthebasicprinciplesandbestpractices\ninanindustrythatisundergoingradicalchange—oldmediaareshape-shiftingandinsome\ncasesdisappearing;newmediaareemergingandmergingwitholdmediaaswellasdevelop-\ningentirelynewfunctions.Thepracticeofadvertising,inparticular,facesnewchallengesin\nan interactive age where consumers are more in charge—actively selecting and designing\ntheirownmediaworldandengagingwiththeirfriendsinnewformsofsocialmedia.This\nNinthEditionreflectsthesechangesasitchallengesitsreaderstoassumecontrolnotonlyof\ntheirmediachoices,butoftheirbiggerroleasconsumersofproducts,ideas,andmedia.\nWHAT’S NEW IN PRINCIPLES & PRACTICE,\nNINTH EDITION\n1. New emphasis on enduring principles in a changing industry\nKeeping up with the dynamic world of advertising and marketing communication is a\nchallenge for any textbook. Recent developments facing the industry including the evolv-\ning world of digital media and the varied consumer responses to the Great Recession re-\nmind us to think about principles that anchor our profession. Although we recognize that\nthe marketing communication environment is in an increasing state of upheaval, we also\nbelieve that the basic principles of advertising and marketing communication are enduring\nand will help the industry adjust to the changing marketplace. We call attention to these en-\nduring principles throughout Principles & Practiceas we describe how the practices are af-\nfected by these new situations.\n2. Increased IMC focus\nTo reflect a wider view of advertising among consumers and within the industry, we\nhave refocused the positioning of Principles & Practiceto add a more obvious discussion\nof integrated marketing communication (IMC). The word advertising, in other words, has\ncome to refer to a variety of marketing communication tools and functions. From the very\nfirst edition, Principles & Practicehas contained discussions about IMC, but in this edition\nwe have made that orientation clear. This broader focus includes all the various forms of\nxix\nxx PREFACE\nmarketing communication—multiplatform, as well as multimedia—and the discussion is\nembedded seamlessly throughout the book.\n3. Increased brand focus\nWe have introduced brand communication in previous editions, but with the more ex-\ntensive use of IMC concepts in the Ninth Edition, we also have adjusted the language in\nPrinciples & Practiceto focus on the point of the communication, which we see as a brand.\nIn other words, instead of talking about an advertisement as if it were an end in itself, we\nnow talk about brand communication. This recognizes that the ad, or any other marketing\ncommunication message, has to be about something. And that something—the focus of all\nthese communication efforts—is the brand.\n4. New set of IMC principles\nFor most of this book’s life, we have made an effort to identify key principles and draw\nattention to them as call-outs in the margins. With the increased emphasis on IMC in the\nNinth Edition, we have also made an effort to develop a set of 10 key IMC-based princi-\nples for brand communication. They evolve within the chapters as various IMC concepts\nare introduced and explained and come together as a set in a much revised Chapter 18, “The\nIMC Umbrella.” This IMC wrap-up chapter explains IMC campaigns and distinguishes\ncampaigns from the management of a Total Communication program.\n5. Language adjustment\nTo reflect this broader focus on brands and IMC, we also needed to adjust the language\nthroughoutPrinciples & Practice.
