If it’s used during a campaign, the objective is to adjust the ad to make it stronger. After-\nward, the research determines the effectiveness of the ad or campaign.\nWe will explore many different types of evaluation methods in Chapter 19, but let’s just men-\ntion two common forms here. Memory can be measured using aided recognition(or recall). A\nresearcher might page through a magazine (or use some other medium) and ask respondents\nwhether they remember seeing a particular ad. Unaided recognition (or recall) means respon-\ndents are asked to tell what they remember without being prompted by seeing the magazine (or\nother medium) to refresh their memories. These tools are used both in developmental research\nand also in evaluation. Strategic, developmental, and evaluative research share some common\ntools and processes and we briefly describe some of these in the following section.\nWHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON RESEARCH METHODS?\nThis section focuses on the types of research used in message development and the research sit-\nuations where these methods are typically used.\nWays of Contact: Quantitative Methods\nConsumer research methodologies are often described in terms of the ways researchers contact\ntheir respondents. The contact can be in person, by telephone, by mail, through the Internet or ca-\nble TV, or by a computer kiosk in a mall or store. Most quantitative research in marketing com-\nmunication is survey based, however, consumers can also be contacted in malls where they are\ninvited to participate in experimental research.\nPrinciple SurveyResearch Inasurvey,questionnairesareusedtoobtaininformationaboutpeople’sat-\nCareful scientific titudes,knowledge,mediause,andexposuretoparticularmessages,andthiswasanimportant\nprocedures are used in part of the Cheetos retargeting campaign.

Instead the people interviewed are a representative sampleof the\nlarger group, a subset of the population that is representative of the entire population.9For survey\nresearch to be an accurate reflection of the population, those who participate must be selected at ran-\ndom, which means every person who belongs to the population being surveyed has an equal likeli-\nhood (probability) of being chosen to participate. For a classic example of how nonrandom sampling\ncan create inaccurate results, consider the Literary Digestpresidential election polling of Landon\nversus Roosevelt in 1936, which produced incorrect results for the presidential election, even\nthough it had a sample size of more than 2 million households. Why? Analysis of the poll results in-\ndicates that both the magazine’s sample and the response were biased and did not accurately predict\nvoter behavior.10\nIncentives are important when doing surveys. As Karl Weiss, a member of this book’s Ad-\nvisory Board and president of a marketing research company explains, choose an incentive that\nCHAPTER 6 • STRATEGIC RESEARCH 175\nSurvey research can be conducted in person and is Phone surveys are commonly used.

Different audiences have different interests so make your incen-\ntive appealing to them. Be careful, however, not to bias your results in the process. If you are\nstudying airline travel behavior and your incentive is a PlayStation, don’t be surprised to find that\nmost of those who complete the survey are males under 35 years old.\nSince survey research first began, the way researchers have gone about collecting data from\nrespondents has seen almost constant change as new technologies have made such research more\ncost efficient:\n• Door-to-Door InterviewsIn the 1950s and 1960s, marketing researchers literally roamed the\nstreets knocking on people’s doors with clipboards in hand in order to gather their\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RESEARCH AWARD<|>EVENT<|>The Research Award is a recognition given for outstanding achievements in research, particularly in the field of marketing communication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEETOS RETARGETING CAMPAIGN<|>EVENT<|>A marketing campaign that utilized survey research to gather data on consumer attitudes and behaviors)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KARL WEISS<|>PERSON<|>Karl Weiss is a member of the book's Advisory Board and president of a marketing research company, providing insights on survey incentives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LITERARY DIGEST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A magazine known for its presidential election polling, which inaccurately predicted the 1936 election results due to biased sampling)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KARL WEISS<|>CHEETOS RETARGETING CAMPAIGN<|>Karl Weiss provided insights on survey incentives, which are crucial for campaigns like the Cheetos Retargeting Campaign<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LITERARY DIGEST<|>RESEARCH AWARD<|>The Literary Digest's polling error is a classic example of the importance of accurate research methods, relevant to discussions in research awards<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
