Mostly they died because of a lack of reader interest—or\nof the marketing needed to build them an online presence. Technorati estimates that there are\nsome 7 to 10 million active blogs but probably between 50,000 to 100,000 generate most of the\npage views.34Other bloggers have moved over to social media. Astudy has found that bloggers\nare getting older as younger users have moved to Twitter.35\nCHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 407\nAnother problem with blogs is that they are sometimes\ncriticized as “stealth advertisers.” Paid posts, where blog-\ngers plug a product in return for cash or freebies from the\ncompany, have caught the attention of the FTC. On a blog\nfor parents, for example, the blogger operator promoted a\n$135 embroidered baby carrier. The blogger admits the\ncompany sent the carrier free. These endorsements are now\nbeing addressed by new advertising guidelines that require\nbloggers to post “clear and conspicuous” disclosures that\nthey have received compensation or freebies.36\nThe concept of a blog with diary and essay postings was\nreinvented in miniature by Twitter, which permits posts no\nlonger than 140 characters. Called tweets, these mini-posts\ninvite users to share their daily doings and immediate\nthoughts with people who have subscribed, called followers,\nto the micro-blog.Generally the followers are people known\nto the Tweeter, although in the case of fans, they may ap-\nproach the size and scale of a large mass audience. Actor\nAshton Kutcher, for example, became the first to collect\n1 million followers on Twitter narrowly beating CNN’s\nbreaking-news feed in a widely publicized race.37\nAdvertising messages also can appear on Twitter as part\nof a user’s stream of messages. As Professor Tom Mueller\npoints out, advertising creatives have always known that\nshort, succinct messages are better, but Twitter forces mar-\ncom messages into the tiny format of 140 characters.38\nAgrowing group of Tweeters have signed up to allow\nadvertisers to send commercial messages under their name.\nSometimes the ads are testimonials embedded in a person’s\nregular stream of Tweets (for example, where to go to find\nThe Bloesem “Let’s Get Personal” blog is a Dutch-\nM&Ms that can be customized or custom-label bottles of\ninfluenced design site by Irene Hoofs, who lives in Kuala\nwine); others turn over their stream to an ad broker that in-\nLampur, Malaysia. The blog was selected by Times.onlineas\nserts messages for brands and organizations, such as the one of its Top 50 design sites. It features all types of design\nMake a Wish Foundation. The idea is that people trust what including architecture, interior design, furniture, fashion,\nappear to be personal messages. Anumber of start-up com- and graphics, as well as Irene Hoof’s running commentary\npanies are trying to match up brands and topics with influ- on the beauty of design. What other blog can you find that\nencers who are important within a topical community. you think is interesting? Who do you think follows it and\nMarketers can create a company account on Twitter why do you think it works?\nthattracksbuzzandbrandreferencesusingaservicesuch\nasSummize.com.AnarmofTwitter,Summizetracksnewsinrealtimeasitsearches,filters,and\nsummarizesthehugeriverofinformationappearingonTwittereverysecond.\nGroups of people with a special interest can contact one another and exchange their opin-\nions and experiences through chat rooms,which are sites located online, sometimes as part of an\norganization’s website, but sometimes completely independent of any company. For example, nu-\nmerous chat rooms are organized around various computer systems (Linux, Apple, ThinkPad,\nSega) and topics (one-to-one marketing, guerilla marketing, virtual marketing). The communica-\ntion is so fast that announcements, rumors, and criticisms can circulate worldwide within a mat-\nter of minutes. Chat rooms also are good information sources about customer experiences as well\nas competitors’offerings.\nSocial Networks The idea of an online community is the metaphor for social media sites, such\nas Facebook, MySpace, and other private or brand-related sites. Social networks link friends,\nfans, or others who share interest in some topic. But mostly, they are about friends. That’s why\non Facebook, when you are invited to connect with someone, you are asked to “friend” them.\nUsers can create posts on their own Facebook site but they can also post them on their friends\n“walls,” as well as to other content sites.\n408 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nMySpacepioneeredthesocialnetworkconceptandisstillimportantwithsome66million\nmembers;however,ithaslostmarketsharetoFacebookwithits96millionmembers,or“friends”\nintheU.S.Facebookisnowaninternationalcommunityofmorethan350millionfriendsaround\ntheworld.39MySpacehasevolvedasaneighborhoodforethnicandlow-incomeusersandothers,\nsuchasartists,wholikeitsmoreclutteredandfunkybuteasilypersonalizedlook.Facebookhas\nacleaner,moreorganizedlookandappealstoamoremainstreamaudience.Althoughsomemar-\nketersmightwriteoffMySpace,itisstillaviablemediumtoreachthedifficultlowerincomeand\nethnicmarkets.40ResearchbytheBIGresearchfirmhasalsofoundthatFacebookusersares\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TECHNORATI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Technorati is a blogger search engine that tracks millions of blogs and provides insights into blogging trends)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FTC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Federal Trade Commission, which regulates advertising practices, including those involving bloggers and paid posts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TWITTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Twitter is a social media platform that allows users to post short messages called tweets, limited to 140 characters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASHTON KUTCHER<|>PERSON<|>Ashton Kutcher is an actor who became the first person to collect 1 million followers on Twitter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CNN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CNN is a news organization that competed with Ashton Kutcher in a race to reach 1 million Twitter followers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOM MUELLER<|>PERSON<|>Professor Tom Mueller, who comments on the effectiveness of short advertising messages on Twitter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IRENE HOOFS<|>PERSON<|>Irene Hoofs is a blogger who runs the Bloesem blog, a Dutch-influenced design site)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOESEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bloesem is a design blog run by Irene Hoofs, featuring various types of design content)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAKE A WISH FOUNDATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A charitable organization that benefits from advertising on social media platforms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACEBOOK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Facebook is a social media platform that connects users through friend requests and allows posting on personal and friends' walls)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYSPACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MySpace is a social networking site known for its personalized look and appeal to ethnic and low-income users)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASHTON KUTCHER<|>TWITTER<|>Ashton Kutcher became the first person to reach 1 million followers on Twitter<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CNN<|>TWITTER<|>CNN's breaking-news feed competed with Ashton Kutcher to reach 1 million followers on Twitter<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IRENE HOOFS<|>BLOESEM<|>Irene Hoofs is the creator and operator of the Bloesem design blog<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACEBOOK<|>MYSPACE<|>Facebook and MySpace are both social networking platforms with different user demographics and features<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAKE A WISH FOUNDATION<|>TWITTER<|>The Make a Wish Foundation uses Twitter for brand and organization messaging<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
