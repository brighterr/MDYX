Barnum brings a Swedish singer to the United States and uses a blitz of newspaper ads, hand-\nbills, and posters, one of the first campaigns. In 1868 the N.W. Ayer agency begins the\ncommission system for placing ads—advertising professionals initially were agents or brokers\nwho bought space and time on behalf of the client for which they received a commission, a per-\ncentage of the media bill. The J. Walter Thompson agency invents the account executiveposition,\na person who acts as a liaison between the client and the agency.\nAs advertisers and marketers became more concerned about creating ads that worked, pro-\nfessionalism in advertising began to take shape. Here, also, is when it became important to have\na definition or a theory of advertising. In the 1880s, advertising was referred to by advertising\nlegend Albert Lasker as “salesmanship in printdriven by a reason why.”Those two phrases be-\ncame the model for stating an ad claimand explaining the supportbehind it.\nOn the retail side, department store owner John Wanamaker hired John E. Powers in 1880\nas the store’s full-time copywriterand Powers crafted an advertising strategy of “ads as news.”\nThe McCann agency, which began in 1902, also developed an agency philosophy stated as “truth\nwell told”that emphasized the agency’s role in crafting the ad message. Printer’s Ink,the adver-\ntising industry’s first trade publication, appeared in 1888. In the early 1900s, the J.

The purpose of advertising during this period was to create\ndemand, as well as a visual identity, for these new brands. Inexpensive brand-named products,\nknown as packed goods, began to fill the shelves of grocers and drug stores. The questionable\nethics of hype and puffery,which is exaggerated promises, came to a head in 1892 when Ladies\nHome Journal banned patent medicine advertising. But another aspect of hype was the use of\npowerful graphics that dramatized the sales message.\nIn Europe, the visual quality of advertising improved dramatically as artists who were also\nillustrators, such as Toulouse-Lautrec, Aubrey Beardsley, and Alphonse Mucha, brought their\ncraftsmanship to posters and print ads, as well as magazine illustrations. Because of the artistry,\nthis period is known as the Golden Age.The artist role moved beyond illustration to become the\nart directorin\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
