In reality, most people who are good at thinking up new ideas will tell you it is hard work.\nThey read, study, analyze, test and retest, sweat, curse, and worry. Sometimes they give up. The\nunusual, unexpected, novel idea rarely comes easily—and that’s as true in science and medicine\nas it is in advertising.\nBut most experts on creativity realize that there are steps to the process of thinking up a new\nidea. One approach called creative aerobicsis a thought-starter process detailed in the Practical\nTipsfeature that works well in advertising because it uses both the head and the heart.\nThe creative process usually is portrayed as a series of steps. English sociologist Graham\nWallas was the first to outline the creative process, but others followed, including Alex Osborn,\none of the founders of the BBDO agency and the Creative Education Foundation.30Let’s sum-\nmarize this classic approach in the following steps:\nStep 1. ImmersionRead, research, and learn everything you can about the problem.\nStep 2. IdeationLook at the problem from every angle; develop ideas; generate as many al-\nternatives as possible.\nStep 3. BrainfagDon’t give up if—and when—you hit a blank wall.\nStep 4. IncubationTry to put your conscious mind to rest to let your subconscious take over.\nStep 5. IlluminationEmbrace that unexpected moment when the idea comes, often when your\nmind is relaxed and you’re doing something else.\nStep 6. EvaluationDoes it work? Is it on strategy?\n250 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nBrainstorming\nAs part of the creative process, some agencies use a thinking\ntechnique known as brainstormingwhere a group of 6 to 10 peo-\nple work together to come up with ideas. One person’s idea stim-\nulates someone else’s, and the combined power of the group\nassociations stimulates far more ideas than any one person could\nthink of alone. The group becomes an idea factory.\nThat’s how the Road Crew concept was developed. This Big\nIdea evolved out of many brainstorming sessions with the project\nleadership team, as well as with people in the communities where\nthe team was working with local leaders to build coalitions to spon-\nsor the effort. Alist of names for the project was compiled and guys\nin bars who fit the target audience profile voted on the winner,\nwhich turned out to be Road Crew. The slogan “Beats driving” was\ndeveloped using the same process.\nThe term brainstorming was coined by Alex Osborn,\nfounder of the advertising agency BBDO and explained in his\nbookApplied Imagination.The secret to brainstorming is to re-\nmain positive and defer judgment. Negative thinking during a\nbrainstorming session can destroy the informal atmosphere nec-\nessary to achieve a novel idea.\nTo stimulate group creativity against a deadline, some\nagencies have special processes or locations for brainstorming\nsessions with no distractions and interruptions, such as cell\nphones and access to e-mail, and walls that can be covered with\nsheets of paper on which to write ideas. Some agencies rent a\nsuite in a hotel and send the creative team there to get away and\nimmerse themselves in the problem.
