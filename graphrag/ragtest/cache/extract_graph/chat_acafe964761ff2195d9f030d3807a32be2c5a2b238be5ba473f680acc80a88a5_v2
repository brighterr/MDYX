All marketing communication tools have strengths and weaknesses. You use\npublic relations, for example, to announce something that is newsworthy, whereas you use sales\npromotion to drive immediate action. Therefore, an IMC plan operates with a set of interrelated\nobjectives that specify the strategies for all of the different tools. Each area has a set of objectives\nsimilar to those outlined earlier for advertising; these will be presented in more detail in chapters\nlater in the book that relate to those areas. For discussion at this point, however, the following list\npresents the main IMC areas in terms of their primary effects:\nâ€¢ Public RelationsAnnounce news; affect attitudes and opinions; maximize credibility and\nlikability; create and improve stakeholder relationships.\nâ€¢ Consumer Sales PromotionStimulate behavior; generate immediate response, intensify\nneeds, wants, and motivations; reward behavior; stimulate involvement and relevance; cre-\nate pull through the channel.\nâ€¢ Trade Sales PromotionBuild industry acceptance; push through the channel; motivate co-\noperation; energize sales force, dealers, distributors.\nâ€¢ Point-of-PurchaseIncrease immediate sales; attract attention at decision point; create inter-\nest; stimulate urgency; encourage trial and impulse purchasing.\nâ€¢ Direct MarketingStimulate sales; create personal interest and relevance; provide informa-\ntion; create acceptance, conviction.\nâ€¢ Sponsorship and EventsBuild awareness; create brand experience, participation, interac-\ntion, involvement; create excitement.\nâ€¢ PackagingIncrease sales; attract attention at selection point; deliver product information;\ncreate brand reminder.\nâ€¢ SpecialtiesReinforce brand identity; continuous brand reminder; reinforce satisfaction; en-\ncourage repeat purchase; reward loyal customers.\nStakeholders We introduced the concept of stakeholders in the IMC introduction in Chapter 2,\nbut letâ€™s look a little deeper into this concept. The target in an IMC plan includes more than just\nconsumers. The term stakeholderrefers to any group of people who have a stake in the success\nof a company or brand.
