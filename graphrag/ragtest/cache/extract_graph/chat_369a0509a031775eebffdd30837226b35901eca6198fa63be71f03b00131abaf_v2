It also was designed as an inte-\ngrated campaign. Here is how Logason explains the encore campaign’s success: “In a market where compet-\nitive SUVs were being heavily subsidized, we sold all cars with close to no discounts (3 to 5 percent off list\nprice is standard in Iceland), which demonstrated the brand’s strength.”\nHis proof: Interest among intended new buyers measured 33 percent (3 percentage points above our aim\nof 20 percent increase), top-of-mind scores placed the brand at 3 (1 higher than our goal). The average age\nof the new CR-V buyer was 43 years of age (exceeding our target by 2 years) and this led to a 15 percent mar-\nket share in the small SUV section, 25 percent over the target, and the largest in the car market by far. Fur-\nthermore the campaign made the new CR-V the fourth most sold car in the country—the best-selling Honda\never in Iceland.\nNot only was the CR-V the best-selling Honda, the campaign drove the CR-V to become the best-selling\nsmall SUV to achieve the position of category leader—outselling the closest competitor 4 to 3. Today Honda\nin Iceland has by far the highest market share of all Honda dealerships in Europe.\nLogason concludes, “All in all it was a textbook campaign of strategic planning where creative insight de-\nrived from research yielded great results. We challenged the target group and created a visual image in their\nmind of them owning the car. It was done in a simple, yet meaningful way that built a bridge between a brand\nand buyer.“\nKey Points Summary\n1.What do we mean bytotal brand communicationin IMC 2.What is retail marketing communication all about,and\nprograms?Integration is both a way to develop campaigns what makes it distinctive?Retailers are merchants who\nthat maximize consistency among all the marcom tools and sell directly to consumers.
