This technology also permits publishers to close\npages (stop accepting new material) just hours before press time (instead of days or weeks as in\nthe past) so that advertisers can drop up-to-the-minute information in their ads. Sophisticated\ndatabase management lets publishers combine the information available from subscriber lists\nwith other public and private lists to create complete consumer profiles for advertisers.\nMagazine Readership Measurement Magazineratesarebasedontheguaranteedcirculation\nthatapublisherpromisestoprovide.Magazinecirculationisthenumberofcopiesofanissuesold,\nnotthereadershipofthepublication(calledreaders-per-copy).Asinglecopyofamagazinemight\nbereadbyonepersonorbyseveralpeople,dependingonitscontent.Timemagazineturnedthein-\ndustryupsidedownwhenitannouncedin2007thatitwouldtrimitsratebase(averagecirculation\nlevel)byalmost20percentto3.25millionfrom4million.(InJuly,2010itcontinuestoholdcir-\nculationat3.4million.)8Moreimportantly,italsoofferedadvertisersafigureforitstotalaudience,\nwhichitestimatesat19.5million.\nSeveralcompaniesattempttoverifythecirculationofmagazines,alongwiththedemographic\nandpsychographiccharacteristicsofspecificreaders.As with newspapers, the Audit Bureau of\nCirculation is responsible for verifying circulation numbers. Created in 1914, the ABC audits sub-\nscriptions as well as newsstand sales and also checks the number of delinquent subscribers and\nrates of renewal. MediaMark, which provides a service called MRI, is the industry leader in mag-\nazine readership measurement. MRI measures readership for many popular national and regional\nmagazines (along with other media). Reports are issued to subscribers twice a year and cover\nreadership by demographics, psychographics, and product use. The Simmons Market Research\nBureau (SMRB) provides psychographic data on who reads which magazines and which prod-\nucts these readers buy and consume. Other research companies such as Starch and Gallup and\nRobinson provide information about magazine audience size and behavior.\nOne problem with these measurement services is the limited scope of their services. MRI,\nfor example, only measures about 210 magazines. That leaves media buyers in the dark regard-\ning who is actually seeing their ads in magazines not covered by MRI’s research. Without the\nservices of an objective (outside) measurement company, advertisers must rely on the data from\nthe magazines themselves, which may be biased.\nOne interesting change in magazine measurement is the move, which is supported by the\nMPA, to quantify the “experience” of reading the magazine, rather than just the circulation and\nreaders-per-copy. Amajor study to pilot test this concept was conducted by the MPA, the North-\nwestern University Media Management Center, and the American Society for Magazine Editors\n(ASME). The study identified a set of 39 types of experiences that people report having with their\nmagazines. More importantly, the study found that the more engaged people were in the maga-\nzine experience, the more impact the advertising had.9\n362 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nDirectories\nNewspapers and magazines are important print media types, but directory advertising is another\nform that is particularly effective at driving specific types of consumer responses. Directories are\nbooks like the Yellow Pagesthat list the names of people or companies, their phone numbers, and\ntheir addresses. In addition to this information, many directories publish advertising from mar-\nketers who want to reach the people who use the directory. Corporations, associations, and other\norganizations, such as non-profits, also publish directories either in print or online that include\nmembers, as well as other stakeholders. These are often provided as a service to members as part\nof a corporate communication program.\nDirectory advertising is designed to get attention, communicate key information about the\norganization, reinforce the company’s brand image and position, and drive behavior, the hardest\nof all facets of advertising effects to achieve. The Terminix ads illustrate how this complex set of\nobjectives was accomplished by the winner of a student advertising competition. The Terminix\njudges commented that Tran’s ads were “terrific examples of creating an unexpected visual with-\nout distracting from the main message.” The judges explained that “this visual coupled with the\nexplicit copy points (all presented in a clean, accessible layout) differentiate (in a very positive\nway) Terminix from its directory competitors.” Tran’s package included a large directory ad, a\nsmall directory ad, and an Internet directory ad.\nOne of the biggest advantages of advertising in directories is that if people have taken the ini-\ntiative to look for a business or service, then the listing is reaching an audience already in the market\nfor something and ready to take action. Directory advertising doesn’t have to create a need because\nit is a number one shopping aid as reflected in the classic Yellow Pages slogan: “Let Your Fingers Do\nthe Walking.” That’s why directory advertising’s biggest ad-\nvantage is directional advertising:it tells people where to go\nto get the product or service they want. If you are going to move\nacross town and you want to rent a truck, you will consult the\nlocal phone book.
