What are the basic techniques of Web design?\nA Strong Mint with a Curious Past\nShortly after the United States fought for its independence from England,\nSmith Kendon created in 1780 a revolutionary British product designed to re-\nlieve intestinal discomfort. It’s name: Altoids. Today we know Altoids as a “cu-\nriously strong mint” designed to fight bad breath. The story about how Altoids\ncame to be the top-selling mint in the United States parallels the evolution of its\nbrand personality.\nAdvertising as far back as the 1920s plugged the “curiously strong” mint-fla-\nvored lozenges, but Altoids was largely unknown in the United States until Kraft\nFood purchased it in 1995 and turned its advertising over to the Leo Burnett agency.\nKraftinheritedaproductthatcameinadistinctive,OldWorld–lookingred-and-\nwhite metal tin emblazoned with the slogan, “The Original Celebrated Curiously\nStrongPeppermints.”TheBurnettcreativesadaptedthatphraseandcapturedthe\nbrandessencewithitscampaign’swryslogan:“TheCuriouslyStrongMint.”\nThe campaign tone features a type of amusing, rather British self-deprecation,\nas if the brand doesn’t take itself seriously. That approach struck a nerve with the\nlargely cynical, sometimes sarcastic Generation X and Y males who have been the\nbrand’s most loyal fans.\nBurnett’s memorable ads from this classic campaign have featured a muscle\nbuilder with the line “Nice Altoids,” a 1950s teenager with oversized braces and\nthe headline “Brace Yourself,” and a stern-looking nurse carrying the little red-and-\nwhite Altoids tin with the headline “Now This Won’t Hurt a Bit.” Another ad pro-\nclaimed, “No Wonder the British Have Stiff Upper Lips.”\nAs you probably know, the Altoids brand has expanded to include new flavors,\nfrom cinnamon and wintergreen to ginger and sours (in a round tin), as well as gum\nand strips. No longer do we think of Altoids for its medicinal qualities.\nChange is an inevitable fact of life. Not only did the product come to mean\nsomething different to consumers over time, brand ownership has changed hands\nand so have the agencies that manage the marketing communication.\nAltoids was a winner for Kraft, so much so that it sold the brand in 2004 to Wm.\nWrigley Jr. Co. for the minty fresh sum of $1.46 billion. The new owner then\nawarded the Altoids advertising account to Publicis & Hal Riney. In late 2008, Mars\n289\n290 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nbought Wrigley, and moved the account to BBDO Chicago. How does a brand\nmaintain a consistent personality amid changing ownership and agencies?\nThe success of a brand’s advertising is based on more than the humor of a sin-\ngle campaign—especially as ownership of a brand shifts. Altoids ads have an iconic\nlook. Most feature an intriguing headline that is only a few words long in all capi-\ntal letters and a drop shadow outline. Many of the ads are laid out on a plain, mint\ngreen background with a double rule border—a great retro look that reflects the\npackage design, which reinforces the brand identity.\nAlthough BBDO Chicago has recently dropped the “Curiously Strong” theme,\nreplacing it with “A Slap to the Cerebellum,” it kept some of the elements from the\nprevious campaign. Steffan Postaer, one of the Leo Burnett creatives whose ideas re-\nsulted in Altoids award-winning work, did not agree entirely with the approach that\nBBDO took. But he said this of the new campaign: “You can still see the brand’s DNA\nin the language and typography as well as in the tone and manner.” Other efforts in-\nclude “Brainstorm,” a branded entertainment collaboration with Fox Mobile Studios.\nSee for yourself what you think gives a campaign continuity by looking at past\nand current advertising at www.altoids.com/ad-gallery.do.Then in the It’s a Wrap\nsection at the end of the chapter, see how well the advertising has performed over\ntime for this intense, extreme, and curiously strong mint.\nSources:www.wrigley.com; www.altoids.com;http://godsofadvertising.wordpress.com/2008/03/13/my-altoids-can-beat-\nup-their-altoids;Rita Chang, “Altoids Pokes Fun at Itself with ‘Brainstorm,’” www.adage.com,September 21, 2009.\nThe visual consistency and wry humor in the Altoids cam-\npaign go far beyond the ability of words to describe things.\nThe quirky images communicate ideas about the brand per-\nsonality, as well as the feelings and sense of humor of the\nbrand’s target market.
