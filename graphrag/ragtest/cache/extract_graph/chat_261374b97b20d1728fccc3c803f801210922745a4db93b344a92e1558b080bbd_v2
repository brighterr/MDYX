In fact, some people refer to DMC as integrated direct marketing\n(IDM).As technology has provided more and better ways to interact with customers, the chal-\nlenge to direct marketers has been to integrate direct mail, catalogs, telemarketing, websites,\ne-mail, text messaging, and instant messaging with other marketing communication, such as ad-\nvertising—and to do so with a consistent brand voice that reflects the brand strategy.\nTwo reasons integration plays so well in the direct-response market is because of its em-\nphasis on the customer and its measurability. The coordination problem is a challenge due to the\ndeluge of data bombarding customers from many different channels. The only way to manage the\ninformation is to focus it around customer needs and interests. By using databases, companies can\nbecome more sensitive to customer wants and needs and less likely to bother them with unwanted\ncommercial messages.\nLinking the Channels Instead of treating each medium separately, as some advertising agencies\ntend to do, DMC companies seek to achieve precise, synchronized use of the right media at the\nright time, with a measurable return on dollars spent.
