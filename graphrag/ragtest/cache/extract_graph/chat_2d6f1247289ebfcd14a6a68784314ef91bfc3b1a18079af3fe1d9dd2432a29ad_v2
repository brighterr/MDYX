They pose. They smile. They pose some\nmore. But what’s behind those chiseled good looks and perma-\nsmiles? We’ll find out as we meet fashion’s hottest new mannequins.\nKelly started out as a small town mannequin with big dreams. She\nwas discovered here in the humble window of Wilma’s Wearables by\na mannequin scout.\nKelly: He offered me a card and a first-class crate to the big city.\nNarrator: Kelly was a hit, especially with the soon-to-be men’s wear super-\nstar, Josh.\nJosh: She was being wheeled by and I just froze.\nNarrator: They were soon inseparable. Then a call came in. Old Navy was look-\ning for a star and loved Kelly’s fresh-faced look. Her life was moving\nso fast that love couldn’t keep up. In the fall 2005 Josh and Kelly split\nup. Kelly had found herself a fresh start and new friends like Michelle.\nMichelle: Being here with Wesley and my kids keeps me grounded. Well, that\nand my metal stand.\nNarrator: Michelle and Wesley met in the spring of 2001 at an auto show. She\nwas working as a minivan display model, he as a crash test dummy.\nIn 2001, they tied the knot in the bridal section of a department\nstore and two months later they became SuperModelquins. But\nthere was one thing missing from the picture: kids.\n129\n130 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nWesley: So we filled out a form and three to four business days later our boy was de-\nlivered. Christopher arrived on February 28 weighing 57 pounds, 4 ounces.\nWhat do you think? Do you like the quirky campaign with the talking models?\nWhat did you like or not like about it? Do you think it was effective advertising? This\nchapter challenges you to think deeply about what makes brands work to accomplish\ntheir business objectives by truly reaching the minds and emotions of their audiences.\nFirst, some background about Old Navy, an offshoot of the Gap. Although Old\nNavy has long stood for value—low budget and somewhat trendy fashions—\nrecently it has faced fierce competition from Target and Kohl’s. Old Navy’s sales\nwere down significantly. Sure, part of the downturn is probably due to the econ-\nomy. But what can be done to reverse the losses?\nOld Navy President Tom Wyatt put his finger on part of the problem: the company\nlost its way when it abandoned the target of moms with young children and focused\non teens. A gold-lamé bikini, such as the one featured in a recent ad campaign, is not\nwhat a 25- to 35-year-old mom is looking for, said Wyatt. Moms went elsewhere to\nshop. The first step of Old Navy’s strategy called for a renewed focus on young moms.\nTo appeal to moms, the campaign used 12 mock supermodels with celebrity-\nworthy stories. They’re featured on TV and the Web on Old Navy’s website.\nThey’ve been featured in a flyer patterned after a celebrity magazine. You can fol-\nlow them on Twitter. These pseudo-celebs have made appearances at an NBA Lak-\ners game, a celebrity party in New York, and a trendy restaurant in Los Angeles.\nSuperModelquins—some 13,000 of them—may even have made their way to an\nOld Navy store near you. (Incidentally, you may be interested to know that the cam-\npaign’s done wonders for Fusion Specialties, the mannequins’ maker.)\nIn your analysis of the campaign’s effectiveness, one of the first questions you\nshould ask yourself is “Does this reach the target audience?” Do you think these\nSuperModelquins “speak” to young moms? A critical lesson is that ads that are\nbased on understanding the consumer market are more likely to speak to their in-\nterests. At the end of the chapter, in the It’s a Wrapfeature, you can find out how\nwell Old Navy achieved its goals.\nSources: www.oldnavyweekly.com;Mae Anderson, “Old Navy’s New Ad Campaign Heavy on ‘Quirky,’” February 2, 2009,\nwww.money.aol.com;Elizabeth Aguilera, “Old Navy’s New Ad Campaign Breaks the Mold and Boosts a Broomfield\nMannequin-Maker,” March 12, 2009, www.denverpost.com;Anne D’Innocenzio, “Gap Earnings Drop 8:3% But Beat Esti-\nmates,” February 26, 2009, www.USAToday.com;Jennifer Reingold, “Gap Tries Branding to Boost Sales,” February 27,\n2009,www.cnnmoney.com.\nThe success of campaigns, such as the Old Navy “SuperModelquins” campaign, hinges on a critical\nconsumer insight that gives direction to the advertising. By recognizing that the store’s ads were speak-\ning to the wrong audience, the CP(cid:2)B team was able to develop a storyline that young mothers would\nfind interesting and fun; at the same time it showcased fashions that were relevant to this audience.\nTobetterunderstandthatconnection,thischapterexploresinfluencesonconsumers’behavior—\ninotherwords,whatmotivatesthemastheymakepurchasingdecisions—andthendiscusseshow\nthesefactorshelpdefinegroupsofpeoplewhomightprofitablybetargetedwithmarketingcommu-\nnic\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
