The primary uses of advertis-\ning are house ads, public service announcements, and corporate advertising.\nHouseAds Anorganization(oramedium,suchasanewspaper,magazine,orbroadcaststation)\nmayprepareahousead,whichisanadforuseinitsownpublicationorprogramming.Conse-\nquently,nomoneychangeshands.Forinstance,alocaltelevisionstationmayrunahouseadan-\nnouncingitsnewfallprogrammingwithinitseveningnewsprogram;likewise,acompanymay\nrunanadadvocatingapointofvieworpromotingaspecialemployeebenefitprogramwithinits\ncorporatemagazine.Thesehouseadsareoftenmanagedbythepublicrelationsdepartment.\nPublic Service Announcements The ads for charitable and civic organizations that run free of\ncharge on television or radio or in print media are called public service announcements (PSAs).\nThe United Way, the American Heart Association, the Greater Chicago Food Depository (see the\naccompanying ad), and local arts councils all rely on PSAs. These ads are prepared just like other\nprint ads or commercials, and in most instances ad agencies donate their expertise and media do-\nnate time and space to run the ads.\nTheAdvertisingCouncilrepresentsaPReffortfortheentireadvertisingindustryandhaspro-\nducedmostofthePSAsyouseeontelevisionandinprint,suchasthe“FriendsDon’tLetFriends\nDriveDrunk”campaign,theUnitedNegroCollegeFund(“AMindIsaTerribleThingtoWaste”),\nthe“KeepAmericaBeautiful”anti-littercampaign,andthemorerecent“IAmanAmerican”cam-\npaignthatwasdevelopedfollowingthetragicterroristattacksofSeptember11,2001.Theclassic\nSmokeyBearcampaign(“OnlyYouCanPreventForestFires”)isoneofitslongestandbest-rec-\nognizedefforts.Anotherclassicisthe“Pollution:KeepAmericaBeautiful”campaignfeaturedhere.\nGetting donated time and space is not easy. The PSAdirectors at various media receive a bar-\nrage of public service campaigns every week on different issues, and they must choose which ones\nto run. There is no guarantee which markets will see the campaign elements, and there is no guar-\nantee that the same people will see the print and TVversions of a campaign. Some PSAcampaigns\ndo not get any airtime or print placements.\nStudies of PSAeffectiveness can help guide nonprofit organizations. For instance, a look at\nPSAs to combat drunk driving, particularly among the college population, found that the usual\nanti–drunk-driving messages are not as relevant to this audience as they might be. They do not\naddress the students’greatest fear: being pulled over and charged with a DUI. The study also\nfound that a localized PSA, one that mentions or uses a local community angle, is more mean-\ningful to the college-age group.25\nProfessor Herb Rotfeld recognizes that many cam-\npaigns have produced effective PSAs to help address social\nills in the A Principled Practice box. Yet he questions\nwhether these campaigns alone can solve the social prob-\nlems they seek to address, especially considering their de-\npendency on the generosity of media outlets to offer free\ntime and space. PSAs can help make people aware of social\nproblems, but they may not eliminate them.\nSHOWCASE\nMatt Miller, art director at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners,\nexplained the strategy behind this ad for the Greater Chicago\nFood Depository. “Even though it may be hard to hear, the\ntruth is, people are skeptical of charities these days. The\nGreater Chicago Food Depository wanted to stand out among\nthe rest. [It wanted] to reassure Chicagoans that the food\nand money they donate goes to other less fortunate\nChicagoans. And that’s why we created the “Fight Empty\nPlates” campaign.”\nMatt Miller is a graduate of the University\nof Colorado where he was a student of\nProfessor Brett Robbs.\nCHAPTER 15 • PUBLIC RELATIONS 473\nA PRINCIPLED PRACTICE\nThe Social Impact of Public Service Advertising\nHerbert Jack Rotfeld,Professor of Marketing, Auburn University\nGovernment and public the media for public service announcements (PSAs),\nagencies concerned they take the placements they can get for free.
