Traditionally, the\ntypes of companies that have made the greatest use of direct marketing have been book and record\nclubs, publishers, insurance companies, sellers of collectibles, and gardening firms.\nMore recently, computer companies have used the direct-response model effectively. Dell,\nfor example, has built its business platform on direct marketing of computers directly to con-\nsumers rather than through dealers, as its competitors do. This is also true for GEICO.\nWhy don’t Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM copy the Dell model and sell computers di-\nrectly? For one thing, their retail dealers, who deliver big sales to these companies, would retal-\niate if these companies started experimenting with direct sales. Furthermore, it takes a lot of effort\nand infrastructure to set up a direct-marketing business. Rather than an army of sales reps, Dell\nemploys an army of people in fulfillment who take the order, match the product to customer spec-\nifications, handle the money, and arrange for shipping.\nButdirectmarketingcancontributetothebrandimpression,aswellassales.Insomecases,if\nthecontactsareirritating,themessagemaybenegative,butifthemessagesarewelldoneandtar-\ngetedtoappropriateaudiences,thentheymaybeappreciated.Skilleddirectmarketers,supportedby\nresearchfindings,havediscoveredthattheappearanceofadirect-responsemessage—thecharacter\nandpersonalitycommunicatedbythegraphics—canenhanceordestroy,notonlythebrandimage,\nbutalsothecredibilityoftheproductinformation.TheCrane&Company“Banknote”brochureis\nanexampleofthepowerofgooddesigntoenhancecorporateimage,eveninB2Bmarketing.\nAgenciesandMediaCompanies Thefourtypesoffirmsindirect-responseadvertisingincludead-\nvertisingagencies,independentdirect-marketingagencies,servicefirms,andfulfillmenthouses:\n• Advertising AgenciesMost major agencies whose main business is mass-media advertising\neither have a department that specializes in direct response or own a separate direct-response\ncompany. Even if there isn’t a special division or department, the staff of the agency may\nstill be involved in producing direct marketing pieces.\n• Direct Marketing AgenciesIndependent direct marketing agencies create the DMC mes-\nsages, arrange for their delivery to a target audience, and evaluate the results.\n• Service FirmsService firms specialize in supplying printing, mailing, list brokering, and\ndata management, as illustrated by the Melissa DATAwebsite near the end of the chapter.\n• Fulfillment HousesThis business is responsible for making sure consumers receive whatever\nthey request in a timely manner, be it a catalog, additional information, or the product itself.\nIn terms of media, there are also thousands of telemarketing and Web marketing firms that\nhandle contact with consumers, as well as a variety of other more traditional media companies.\nOne of the most active direct-mail media organizations, for example, is the U.S. Postal Service.\nWe’ll discuss these tools later in the section on DMC media.\nCustomers and Prospects Although people might dislike the intrusiveness of direct-response\nadvertising, many appreciate the convenience. It is a method of purchasing goods in a society that\nis finding itself with more disposable income but with less time to spend it. Anew generation of\nconsumers armed with push-button phones and a billfold full of credit cards likes to shop from\nhome. This push-button shopper is joined by an even larger group of mouse-clicking shoppers.\nAlthough it takes some daring to order a product you can’t see, touch, feel, or try out, more and\nCHAPTER 16 • DIRECT RESPONSE 491\nSHOWCASE\nThis beautifully designed B2B\nbrochure was created by Peter\nStasiowski when he was art\ndirector at Gargan Communi-\ncations in Dalton, Massachu-\nsetts.
