Ads running in Reader’s Digest,which is a 6 (cid:5)9 format, allow for fewer\nvisuals and little copy.\n• OwnershipSome magazines are owned by publishing companies (Glamour,Brides,Vanity\nFair,andThe New Yorkerare owned by Condé Nast), and some are published by organiza-\ntions such as AARP. Some magazines are published by consumer companies, such as Kraft’s\nFood & Family,that sell ads and carry stories and ads for many of their own products.\n• Distribution and CirculationMagazine revenues come from advertising, subscriptions, and\nsingle-copy sales. According to the MPA, advertising in general contributes 55 percent of\nmagazine revenue and circulation is 45 percent (subscriptions 32 percent; single-copy sales\n13 percent).7\nControlled versus Uncontrolled Circulation Traditional delivery, called controlled circula-\ntion,is through newsstand purchases or home delivery via the U.S. Postal Service. These are mea-\nsured media and their circulation or sales can be determined. Nontraditional delivery,referred to\nas uncontrolled circulation, means that the magazine is distributed free to specific audiences.\nGenerally speaking, uncontrolled (free) circulation magazines have lower readership and therefore\nalso lower ad costs. They may also be sponsored by a company and sent to key stakeholders as part\nof a corporate communication program. In addition to mail, other nontraditional delivery methods\ninclude hanging bagged copies on doorknobs, inserting magazines in newspapers (such as Parade\nmagazine), delivering through professionals’offices (doctors and dentists), direct delivery (com-\npany magazines or those found on airplanes), and electronic delivery, which is being used by or-\nganizational and membership publications, such as university alumni magazines.\nMagazine Ad Sales Like newspapers, magazine ad costs are based on the size of the ad and the\ncirculation of the magazine. Media planners and buyers analyze a magazine’s circulation so they\ncan assess circulation potential and determine whether the audiences that best match a campaign’s\ntarget will be reached. In deciding in which magazines to place ads, advertisers need to consider\nfactors such as format and technology.\nAlthough the format may vary from magazine to magazine, all magazines share some for-\nmat characteristics. For example, the inside front and back cover pages are the most costly for ad-\nvertisers because they have the highest level of exposure compared to all the other pages in a\nmagazine. The inside back cover is also a premium position.\nNormally, the largest unit of ad space that magazines sell is the double-page spread, in\nwhich two ad pages face each other. Adouble-page ad must jump the gutter,the white space run-\nning between the inside edges of the pages, meaning that no headline words can run through the\ngutter and that all body text is on one side or the other. Apage without outside margins, in which\nthe ad’s ink extends to the very edge of the page, is called a bleed.Magazines sometimes offer\nmore than two connected pages (four is the most common number) that fold in on themselves.\nThis kind of ad is called a gatefold.The use of multiple pages that provide photo essays is an ex-\ntension of the gatefold concept.\nAnotherpopularformatisaspecialadvertisingpageorsectionthatlookslikeregulareditorial\npagesbutisidentifiedbytheword“advertisement”atthetop.Thecontentisusuallyanarticleabout\nacompany,product,orbrandthatiswrittenbythecorporation’spublicitydepartment.Theideais\nCHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 361\ntomimictheeditoriallookinordertoacquirethecredibilityofthepublication’sarticles.Multiple-\npage photo essay ads are more common in magazines such as Fortune and BusinessWeek; these\nmagazinesmaypresent,forexample,a20-pagespecialsectionforbusinessesinaforeigncountry.\nFinally,asinglepageordoublepagecanbebrokenintoavarietyofunitscalledfractionalpage\nspace(forexample,verticalhalf-page,horizontalhalf-page,half-pagedoublespread,andchecker-\nboardinwhichanadislocatedintheupperleftandthelowerrightofadouble-pagespread).\nTechnology New technologies have enabled magazines to distinguish themselves from one an-\nother. For example, selective bindingandink-jet imagingallow publishers to personalize issues\nfor individual subscribers. Selective binding combines information on subscribers kept in a data-\nbase with a computer program to produce magazines that include special sections for subscribers\nbased on their demographic profiles. Ink-jet imaging allows a magazine such as U.S. News &\nWorld Reportto personalize its renewal form so that each issue contains a renewal card already\nfilled out with the subscriber’s name, address, and so on. Personalized messages can be printed\ndirectly on ads or on inserts (“Mr. Jones—check out our new mutual fund today”).\nTimeInc.andLexushopedtorevitalizethemagazinebusinesswithanewventurecalledMine\nandanewapproachtopersonalizedmarketingcommunication.Itsphilosophywascustomization,\nsimilartowhatLexusoffersitsupscalecustomers,butinthisprintpublication,it’stheadsthatare\ncustomized—“Hello(nameofcustomer),”aswellastheselectionofarticlesfromTimeInc.’sport-\nfolioofpublications.TheideafortheexperimentcamefromTeamOne,theLexusagency.\nSatellite transmission, along with computerized editing technology, allows magazines to\nprint regional editions with regional advertising.
