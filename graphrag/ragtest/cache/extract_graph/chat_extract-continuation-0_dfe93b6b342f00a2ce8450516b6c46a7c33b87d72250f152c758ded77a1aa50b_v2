They are wary of Kodak’s move and wonder if the link between the Kodak\nbrand and film is too strong to stretch to digital products. Instead, they recommend using a new\nbrand name for the line of digital products.12It will be interesting to see how this repositioning\nstrategy turns out and if Kodak’s position can be redefined as galleries of pictures rather than film\nand photo albums.\nForanexampleofaneffectiverepositioningeffort,RiesandRiespointtoIBMasacompany\nthatrepositioneditselffromacomputermanufacturertoaproviderofservices.Eventhoughthe\nmarketformainframecomputershasbeendeclining,theyobservethattheconnectionwithIBM’s\nbrandessenceisstillthereinIBM’snewpositionasaglobalcomputerservicecompany.Anex-\namplecomesfromChinawhereIBMismarketinganurban-planningtoolcalledSmartCitythat\nconnects public services and infrastructure projects through information technology.

The role of the brand communication strategy, then, is to relate the product’s posi-\ntion to the target market’s life experience and associations. The principle in repositioning is to\nmove ahead while at the same time retaining the brand essence. Aclassic example of an effective\nrepositioning campaign that retains the brand essence as it carves out a new location in con-\nsumers’minds is 7-Up, which is described in the A Matter of Principlefeature.\nBut sometimes the repositioning strategy may not work. How will it work, for example,\nwhen Rolls-Royce unveils an economy car, or at least one that costs a third less than its $380,000\nflagship Phantom. Can Rolls use a cheaper car to pump up volume sales or will that strategy di-\nlute the brand’s exclusive image?\nBrand Communication Strategy\nAfter the objectives, targeting, and positioning have been stated, the next step is to decide the key\nstrategic approach that will deliver the objectives.
