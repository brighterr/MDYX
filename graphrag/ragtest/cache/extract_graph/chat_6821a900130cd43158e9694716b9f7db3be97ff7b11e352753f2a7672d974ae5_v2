The consumer is much more in control now.”7This change is caus-\ning some shifts in the way the advertising business operates.\nIn 2009 CareerBuilder dismissed one of the most creative agencies—Portland-based Wieden (cid:2)\nKennedy, who had created five great Super Bowl ads for the job-posting website—and took its ad-\nvertising in house. The reason is that the company wants ordinary consumers to create 25-second com-\nmercials for the brand. That will not only bring publicity, but also save bucks. CareerBuilder, through\nits in-house agency, will still pay for production of the winning ad and buy the ad time. Not only will\nthis move bring more opportunities for consumer-generated advertising(at the expense of advertising\nagencies), the company estimates it will save around 15 to 20 percent of its annual marketing costs.8\nOther brands that have used consumer-generated ads include Frito-Lay, Converse, Master-\nCard, and L’Oreal. Frito-Lay received thousands of media mentions for its Super Bowl ad con-\ntest on such programs as The Tonight Show,The View,andGood Morning America. You can check\nout Doritos’collection of consumer-generated Super Bowl ads in the “Crash the Super Bowl”\ncontest at www.crashthesuperbowl.com/#/winners.\nConsumer involvement in advertising is a bigger issue than just ad agencies losing their\nclients. In fact, consumers have been taking control of media and marketing for a number of\nyears through Wikipedia, Twitter, and other newly democratized information sources. YouTube,\nMySpace, and Facebook have invited everyone into the ad distribution game. The Internet is a\nnew world of interaction and consumer-initiated contacts that are creating entirely new ways of\ncommunicating with potential customers. That’s why in 2006, Timemagazine spotted the trend\nand named “You the Consumer” as its Person of the Year and then in 2007 Advertising Agenamed\nthe consumer its “Agency of the Year.”\nBlurring Lines and Converging Media\nOne of the biggest changes impacting the advertising industry is the changing media environ-\nment. Television used to be the big gun, and it still eats up the biggest part of the budget, but the\nold networks (CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX) are only half as important as they used to be as the num-\nber of cable channels has exploded.\nThe big bomb that has fragmented the media world is digital media, which appear in so many\ndifferent forms that it’s impossible to keep up with them. The newspaper industry has been par-\nticularly hurt as it has realized that much, if not most, of its content can be accessed more easily\nand quickly in a digital format. So are newspapers dead?\nTraditional media are trying to adjust by transforming themselves into new digital formats,\nas well. So what do you call online versions of newspapers and magazines? Are they still print\nwhen they appear on a screen? And new personal media—iPhones, iPods, iPads, BlackBerries,\nKindles—are real shape-changers. They can be phones, music players, calendars, and sources of\nlocal and national information, as well as cameras, video viewers, book readers, Web surfers, and\nvideo game players. Changes such as these need to be considered when putting together media\nplans, a challenge that will be discussed in Part 3.\nAdvertising agencies make most of their money from television spots and print media. How-\never, as we’ve mentioned, both of those revenue streams are threatened by economics and the chang-\ning media landscape. As Mike Carlton explains, “TVspots and other traditional work as the economic\nbackbone of the agency business will just not work much longer.”9However, Carlton also calls for\nCHAPTER 1 • THE NEW WORLD OF MARKETING COMMUNICATION 27\nagencies to take a stronger leadership role in the development of brand strategy, particularly for the\nmore complex forms of marketing communication with their blurred, merged, and converged media.\nAccountability and Effectiveness\nGiventherecentrecession,youcanguessthatefficiencyisanadvantageinthisnewadvertisingworld,\nwhichhasbeenemphasizingaccountabilityforacoupleofdecades.Theothercriticalclientconcern\niseffectiveness,whichisanotherwaytolookataccountabilityinmarketingcommunication.\nWe mentioned that CareerBuilder had taken its advertising in house partly to drive a consumer-\ngenerated advertising program, but also to save costs, which is critical in an economic downturn.\nThe need for efficiency is complicated by crack-ups in the agency–client relationships. Agencies\nthat are creative in finding new ways to deliver cost efficiencies have a real advantage in their\nclient dealings.\nEffectiveness Alongwiththeongoingneedforefficiencies,there’salwaysaconcernaboutef-\nfectiveness,oraccountabilityasit’ssometimescalled,butthishasbecomeevenmoreimportantin\ndifficulttimes.Therecentrecessionforcedtheadvertisingindustrytobecomeevenmoreserious\naboutcreatingadvertisingthatdeliversresultsandthenprovingtheeffectivenessoftheadvertising\nworkonceit’scompleted.Effectivenessisathemethatyouwillseediscussedthroughout\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
