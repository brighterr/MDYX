Instead of talking about “binge” drinking, we\ntalked about “drinking too much.” Just changing the terminology we used caused a radical\nchange in the responses we received. Students know what drinking too much is. Most had\nexperienced it firsthand; all had seen it for themselves.\nThere is a line between “drinking” (which can be a lot of fun) and “drinking too much”\n(which can lead to unwelcome consequences). The more we discussed the idea of this line,\nthe more we realized we had all crossed the line at one time or another, and none of us re-\nally wanted to cross it again.\nStrategy: What We Want to Do and What We Want to Communicate\nWe want to “curb underage binge drinking.” We aren’t trying to stop drinking. As communi-\ncators, it is crucial that we accept what we can change and what we can’t change. College stu-\ndents are going to drink. However, if we can speed up this learning process of “how to drink”\nwe have the potential of avoiding unwelcome consequences and maybe even saving lives.\nWe headed back to the bars and fraternity houses to try and figure out wherethat line\nis. But, it’s not a line. It’s a drink. The line between drinking and drinking too much is ac-\ntually one drink. There is one drink between “in control” and “out of control.” There is one\ndrink between a fun night with friends and a night of regrettable consequences. There is one\ndrink where your judgment decreases and consumption increases.\nWe decided to name our “bad guy.” We didn’t have to look very far to hear how stu-\ndents refer to drinking too much. Acollege student in one of our focus groups referred to\nhis weekend as “getting stupid” and the name “The Stupid Drink” stuck.\nStrategy Our strategy was to teach students how to drink responsibly by identifying and\nstigmatizing the one drink (The Stupid Drink) that separates enjoyable drinking from\nnegative consequences that occur from drinking too much. In doing this, we hypothe-\nsized we could greatly reduce the prevalence of binge drinking on college campuses.\nTarget audience Naive drinkers on college campuses who haven’t yet learned how to\ndrink responsibly. They tend to be freshmen and sophomores away from home for the\nfirst time, but can also be juniors and seniors caught up in out-of-control social drinking\nsituations.\n608 APPENDIX\nThe “Big Idea” The Stupid Drink is the drink between drinking and drinking too much.\nFor some, The Stupid Drink might be indicated by a feeling; for some, a number of\ndrinks; and for others, it might even be one type of alcohol such as tequila.\nTonality We know authoritarian messages don’t work with this newly independent young\nadult. And although students respond well to humor, we have to be extremely careful we\ndon’t allow the seriousness of the message to get lost.\nConfirming Our Strategy\nBefore we began creating communications, we tested the idea. We explained the concept to\na group of serious college drinkers and checked back with them after a weekend of party-\ning. It worked. Our test group reported back that they figured out where their Stupid Drink\nwas and to a person really didn’t wantto drink beyond that. They reported having a lot more\nfun and feeling a lot better the day after. They were sold. And, they were safe.\nWe realized we had come upon a universal insight. We all have a stupid drink—\nprofessors, students, parents, etc. There is one drink between being in control and out of\ncontrol for all of us.\nStudents also talked about how easy it was to talk about their “stupid drink” around\nfriends as well as tell others when they were beyond their stupid drink. We knew for our\nconcept to be effective, the term had to be very natural in any setting. This was all becom-\ning very exciting.\nCREATIVE EXECUTIONS\nThe plan for our messaging is to begin several weeks before freshmen get to campus with\na postcard sent home announcing the discovery of The Stupid Drink and encouraging stu-\ndents to check out The Drinking Institute online. Because we wanted to “teach” our fellow\nstudents safe and responsible drinking habits, we created a fictitious “Drinking Institute”\nheaded by friendly scientists such as Bill Ney, the Science Guy. In a television commercial\nand viral video, The Drinking Institute announces its revolutionary discovery after years of\nresearch. It discovered The Stupid Drink—the drink between drinking and drinking too\nmuch.\nThe Drinking Institute website allows students to visit this fictitious institute, roam the\nhalls, do experiments on subjects, and come to their own conclusion about drinking too\nmuch. AFacebook application allows students to tag their friends with “symptoms of stu-\npid” after they have gone too far such as “handsy friend.” Is your best friend slurring her\nspeech? Our mobile messaging application allows you to text another with her “symptom\nof stupid” during a party. Drinking at a sporting event? The Stupid Drink billboard will\nprove an effective reminder at just the right time.\nBars love people who drink and have a good time. They don’t like patrons who get\nsick in the bar or go out and get hurt afterward. Our bar coasters with cute definitions of\nThe Stupid Drink such as “the line between ‘I’m good’and ‘my bad’” and The Stupid Drink\nID stamp will allow bars to remind patrons to have a great time, but not to go beyond their\nstupid drink. If you are drinking beer in a bar, sooner or later you will visit the restroom\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>THE STUPID DRINK<|>EVENT<|>The Stupid Drink is a concept used to describe the point at which drinking transitions from being fun to leading to negative consequences.
