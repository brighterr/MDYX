In moving the campaign to Japan, Apple’s agency, TBWA/Chiat/Day wrestled with the\nCHAPTER 8 • THE CREATIVE SIDE 253\nfact that in Japanese culture, direct-comparison ads are considered rude. The Japanese version\nwas tweaked to make the Apple more of a home computer and the PC a work tool, so the dif-\nferences were focused more on place than person.31The point is that cultural differences of-\nten require nuanced and subtle changes in ads if they are to be acceptable beyond the country\nof their origin.\nEvaluation: The Go/No-Go Decision\nHow do you decide if the creative idea is strong enough to justify the expense of creating a cam-\npaign based on it? Whether local or global, an important part of managing creative work is eval-\nuation, which happens at several stages in the creative process. Chapter 19focuses on evaluation,\nbut we’ll introduce some basics here to help you understand this important final step in the cre-\native process.\nAnew book on Bill Bernbach and the golden age of advertising, Nobody’s Perfectby Doris\nWillens,32analyzed the brilliant advertising his creative team at DDB produced during the 1960s.\nIn commenting on the book, positioning guru Al Ries observed that Bernbach was a true creative\ngenius because he had the ability to sort good ideas from bad. Ries concluded, “It’s a trait that’s\nextremely rare.”33\nSo nobody starts off being a Bernbach, but everyone can learn to be more critical about the\nadvertising they see. The first question is: Is it on strategy? No matter how much the creative peo-\nple, client, or account executive may like an idea, if it doesn’t communicate the right message or\nthe right product personality to the right audience at the right time, then it is not effective. That’s\nthe science of advertising.\nStructural Analysis The Leo Burnett agency has an approach for analyzing the logic of the cre-\native strategy that goes beyond just evaluating the strategy. The Burnett creatives use it to keep\nthe message strategy and creative concept working together, along with the head and heart ap-\npeals. This method, called structural analysis,relies on these three steps:\n1. Evaluate the power of the narrativeor story line (heart).\n2. Evaluate the strength of the product claim(head).\n3. Considerhowwellthetwoareintegrated—thatis,howthestorylinebringstheclaimto\nlife.\nBurnett creative teams check to see whether the narrative level is so high that it overpowers\nthe claim or whether the claim is strong but there is no memorable story. Ideally, these two ele-\nments will be so seamless that it is hard to tell whether the impact occurs because of the power\nof the story or the strength of the claim. Such an analysis keeps the rational and emotional sides\nof an advertisement working together.\nCopytesting Aformal method to evaluate the effectiveness of an ad, either in draft form or af-\nter it has been executed, is called copytesting.Remember: To evaluate the results, the objectives\nneed to be measurable, which means they can be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of the\ncreative strategy. Copytesting uses a variety of tools to measure and predict the impact of the ad-\nvertisement. Chapter 19explains these tools in more detail.\nAparticular problem that Big Ideas face is that the message is sometimes so creative that the\nad is remembered but not the product. That’s called vampire creativity,and it is one reason some\nadvertisers shy away from really novel or entertaining strategies. That’s also why it is important\nto copytest the effectiveness of the ad’s creative features while still in the idea stage to determine\nif there is brand linkage and memorability.\nLooking Ahead\nThat’s a brief review of the changes in message strategy prompted by the economic downturn.\nThe next step in learning about the inner workings of the creative side is to move to the execu-\ntion of message—both copy and design. We’ll talk first about copywriting in Chapter 9and then\nvisual communication in Chapter 10.\n254 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nIT’S A WRAP\nFrontier’s Still the One\nFrontier Airlines and Grey Worldwide sent an unmistakable message that airline advertising doesn’t need\nto be stuffy. Talking and singing animals broke through the clutter demonstrating another lesson: You can\nsell your audience and entertain them simultaneously, but accomplishing the client’s business goals is central\nto success. Maybe the most important lesson of this work is that a strong brand and a good story can even\nhelp a company survive bankruptcy.\nOver time the animals and their quirky personalities made an emotional connection with would-be trav-\nelers. A campaign about sending an animal to a warm weather destination is much more fun than a plain\nvanilla announcement that an airline now has a route to Mexico. Animals that sing a spirited rendition of\n“You’re Still the One” show that, in spite of hard times, Frontier is “Still a Whole Different Animal” and a brand\nworth celebrating.\nFrontier’s campaigns demonstrate both the art and science of advertising. At the same time the message\nstrategies for these campaigns resulted in a hard-nosed, business-building effort, the creative ideas also cap-\ntivated consumers. The advertising works not only because it delivers on the brand promise, but also because\ncustomers like the airline more because of the campaign and are engaged enough with the Frontier brand to\nfollow the stories of its cast of characters.\nFrontier’s advertising has been recognized with a hangar full of awards. Frontier was nominated for “best\nof show” at the International Mobius awards\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple is a technology company known for its innovative products, including the Mac system, and its creative advertising strategies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TBWA/CHIAT/DAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TBWA/Chiat/Day is an advertising agency that worked on Apple's campaign in Japan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILL BERNBACH<|>PERSON<|>Bill Bernbach was a creative genius in advertising, known for his work at DDB during the 1960s)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DORIS WILLENS<|>PERSON<|>Doris Willens is an author who wrote 'Nobody’s Perfect', a book about Bill Bernbach and the golden age of advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AL RIES<|>PERSON<|>Al Ries is a positioning guru who commented on Bill Bernbach's creative genius)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEO BURNETT AGENCY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Leo Burnett agency is known for its structural analysis approach to evaluating creative strategies in advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRONTIER AIRLINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Frontier Airlines is an airline known for its creative advertising campaigns featuring talking and singing animals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREY WORLDWIDE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Grey Worldwide is an advertising agency that collaborated with Frontier Airlines on their creative campaigns)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE<|>TBWA/CHIAT/DAY<|>TBWA/Chiat/Day worked on Apple's advertising campaign in Japan<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BILL BERNBACH<|>DORIS WILLENS<|>Doris Willens wrote a book about Bill Bernbach's contributions to advertising<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BILL BERNBACH<|>AL RIES<|>Al Ries commented on Bill Bernbach's creative genius<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRONTIER AIRLINES<|>GREY WORLDWIDE<|>Grey Worldwide collaborated with Frontier Airlines on their creative advertising campaigns<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
