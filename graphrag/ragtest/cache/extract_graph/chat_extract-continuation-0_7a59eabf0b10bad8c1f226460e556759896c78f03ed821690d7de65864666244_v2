This type of programming offers\nmovies, specials, and sports under such plans as Home Box Office, Showtime, and The Movie\nChannel. Pay networks do not currently sell advertising time.\nLocal Television Most local television stations are affiliated with a network and carry both net-\nwork programming and their own programs. Independent stationsare local stations not affiliated\nwith networks. Costs for local advertising vary, depending on the size of the market and the de-\nmand for the programs carried. For example, a major station in Houston may charge local adver-\ntisers $2,000 for a 30-second spot during network prime time. This same time slot may cost $50 in\na smaller town. Most advertisers for the local market are local retailers, primarily department stores\nor discount stores, financial institutions, automobile dealers, restaurants, and supermarkets. Ad-\nvertisers buy time on a station-by-station basis. National advertisers sometimes buy local adver-\ntising on a city-by-city basis, using spot buys.They do this to align the buy with their product\ndistribution, to “heavy-up” a national schedule to meet competitive activities, or to launch a new\nproduct in selected cities. Even some cable channels are attempting to localize their programming\nCHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 377\nto gain ground in this market. ESPN, for example, which dominates national and international\nsports viewing, is testing the use of local websites to report on hometown sports teams.\nPublic Television Although many people still consider public televisionto be commercial free, Principle\nthe FCC allows the approximately 350 Public Broadcasting System (PBS) stations some leeway If you want to reach an\nin airing commercial messages, called program underwriting. The FCC says these messages otherwise difficult-to-\nshould not ask for a purchase or make price or quality comparisons. PBS is an attractive medium reach target—the well-\nfor advertisers because it reaches affluent, well-educated households. In addition, PBS still has a educated, affluent\nhousehold—one way to\nrefined image, and PBS advertisers are viewed as good corporate citizens because of their sup-\ndo it is to underwrite\nport for noncommercial TV. Current FCC guidelines allow ads to appear on public television only\npublic television\nduring the local 2.5-minute program breaks. Each station maintains its own acceptability guide-\nprogramming.\nlines. Some PBS stations accept the same ads that appear on paid programming. However, most\nPBS spots are created specifically for public stations. Some PBS stations will not accept any com-\nmercial corporate advertising, but they do accept noncommercial ads that are “value neutral”—\nin other words, ads that make no attempt to sell a product or service.\nSyndication An important revenue stream for networks and cable channels, such as HBO, that\nproduce original programming is syndication. As in radio programming, television syndication\nrefers to content providers that sell their programs to independent firms and other cable channels\nto replay as reruns. Some of the most popular first-run programs, such as HouseandLaw & Or-\nder,are valuable properties and move quickly into syndication.\nNew Technology and Innovative Television New technology is having an impact on program-\nming options, as well as on distribution patterns and systems. Innovations, such as high-definition\nTVand interactive TV, expand advertising opportunities.\nHigh-definition TV (HDTV)is a type of TVstandard that delivers movie-quality, high-res-\nolution images. All over-the-air stations broadcast their programming in an HDTVformat. It’s\nbeen a struggle, however, getting enough HDTVprogramming broadcast to build demand on the\nconsumer side. As stations upgraded their equipment and moved to HDTVby 2009, the increased\navailability of HDTVprogramming made it necessary for consumers to upgrade to HDTVsets.\nSay you’re watching your favorite program and a commercial comes on for a product that\ninterests you. Abutton pops up on the screen that you can click with your remote and you are\nasked questions about whether you want more information, a coupon, or to give some other re-\nsponse. Cable and DVRs are making interactive televisionfeasible. The technology requires that\nadvertisers give their ads to TiVo, for example, where codes are embedded. The ads are then dis-\ntributed to TVand cable networks. When the ad airs, the digital video recorder boxes pick up the\ncoding and turn on the interactive component for that subscriber. Axe used it to show young men\nhow to use its body spray. The ad featured a motocross champion performing a motorbike stunt.\nWhile doing a back flip, the star ripped off his shirt and sprayed Axe from armpit to armpit. View-\ners were then asked to go to a different channel to learn the move. Other features included videos\nand Web pages that can be navigated by using the remote control.\nInteractivetelevisionalsoopensuptheopportunityforaddressabletelevision,whichisa\ntypeoftelevisionthatmakesitpossibleforindividualhomestoreceivetargetedandpersonalized\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WTBS-ATLANTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WTBS-Atlanta is a superstation whose programs are carried by satellite to cable operators)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WGN-CHICAGO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WGN-Chicago is a superstation whose programs are carried by satellite to cable operators)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WWOR-NEW YORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WWOR-New York is a superstation whose programs are carried by satellite to cable operators)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISH NETWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dish Network provides satellite television services and equipment in the United States)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIRECTV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DirecTV provides satellite television services and equipment in the United States)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOME BOX OFFICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Home Box Office offers pay programming and on-demand programming for an additional monthly fee)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHOWTIME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Showtime offers pay programming and on-demand programming for an additional monthly fee)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE MOVIE CHANNEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Movie Channel offers pay programming and on-demand programming for an additional monthly fee)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESPN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ESPN is a cable channel that dominates national and international sports viewing and is testing local websites for hometown sports teams)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC BROADCASTING SYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Public Broadcasting System (PBS) is a network of approximately 350 stations that allows some commercial messages under FCC guidelines)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FCC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Federal Communications Commission regulates broadcasting and allows PBS to air commercial messages under certain guidelines)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOUSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>House is a popular first-run television program that moves quickly into syndication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAW & ORDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Law & Order is a popular first-run television program that moves quickly into syndication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIVO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TiVo is a company that enables interactive television by embedding codes in ads for targeted advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AXE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Axe is a brand that used interactive television to show young men how to use its body spray)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WTBS-ATLANTA<|>WGN-CHICAGO<|>Both WTBS-Atlanta and WGN-Chicago are superstations whose programs are carried by satellite to cable operators<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WTBS-ATLANTA<|>WWOR-NEW YORK<|>Both WTBS-Atlanta and WWOR-New York are superstations whose programs are carried by satellite to cable operators<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WGN-CHICAGO<|>WWOR-NEW YORK<|>Both WGN-Chicago and WWOR-New York are superstations whose programs are carried by satellite to cable operators<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DISH NETWORK<|>DIRECTV<|>Both Dish Network and DirecTV provide satellite television services and equipment in the United States<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOME BOX OFFICE<|>SHOWTIME<|>Both Home Box Office and Showtime offer pay programming and on-demand programming for an additional monthly fee<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOME BOX OFFICE<|>THE MOVIE CHANNEL<|>Both Home Box Office and The Movie Channel offer pay programming and on-demand programming for an additional monthly fee<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHOWTIME<|>THE MOVIE CHANNEL<|>Both Showtime and The Movie Channel offer pay programming and on-demand programming for an additional monthly fee<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ESPN<|>PUBLIC BROADCASTING SYSTEM<|>Both ESPN and PBS are involved in broadcasting, with ESPN focusing on sports and PBS on public television<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FCC<|>PUBLIC BROADCASTING SYSTEM<|>The FCC regulates PBS by allowing it to air commercial messages under certain guidelines<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOUSE<|>LAW & ORDER<|>Both House and Law & Order are popular first-run television programs that move quickly into syndication<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIVO<|>AXE<|>TiVo enabled Axe to use interactive television for targeted advertising<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
