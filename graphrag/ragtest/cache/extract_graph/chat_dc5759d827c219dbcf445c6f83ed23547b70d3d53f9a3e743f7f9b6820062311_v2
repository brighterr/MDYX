Unfortunately, these ideas vary\nPrinciple\nso much that creating general guidelines for good taste in advertising is difficult. Different things Good taste is a difficult\noffend different people at different times. In addition, taste changes over time. What was offen- standard to apply\nsive yesterday may not be considered offensive today. The Odorono ad offended people in 1919, because different things\nbut would it today? By today’s standards that advertisement seems pretty tame. Today’s questions offend different people\nof taste center on the use of sexual innuendo, nudity, vulgarity, and violence. What about the Axe at different times.\nads for male body sprays? Do you find them offensive or in good taste?\nAn ad can be offensive to the general public even if the targeted audience accepts it. Brand\ncommunicators would be wise to conduct research to gauge the standards of taste for the general\npopulation as well as the specific target audience. If they fail to do so, advertisers risk alienating\npotential consumers. Such was the case with Abercrombie and Fitch’s sexually explicit ads aimed\nat young teens that spawned a grassroots campaign to stop the company’s marketing tactics. Some\nmight argue that any publicity is good publicity, and offensive advertising calls attention to your\nproduct in a memorable way.\nTheA Principled Practicebox by Herbert Rotfeld discusses this topic in more detail.\nSex Appeals and Body Image Advertising that portrays women (or men) as sex objects is con-\nsidered demeaning and sexist, particularly if sex is not relevant to the product. Sometimes ads use\nsex appeals that are relevant to the product, such as those used by Victoria’s Secret. The ethical\nquestion then is how sexy is too sexy. Transit authorities in two Canadian cities decided Virgin\nMobile’s ads were too racy for the public and asked the company to pull risqué ads from bus shel-\nters that showed embracing couples and invited viewers to “Hook up fearlessly.”6 Explicitly\nusing sex appeals to sell may not always be appropriate as Professor Rotfeld argued in the A Prin-\ncipled Practicefeature.\nPlaying on consumers’insecurities about their appearance presents advertisers with a classic\nethical dilemma because self-image advertising can be seen as contributing to self-improvement,\nbut sometimes, such advertising is questionable because it leads to dangerous practices. Some\ncritics charge that women place their health at risk in order to cultivate an unrealistic or even un-\nhealthy physical appearance. Supermodels don’t always project healthy portrayals of women.\nCritic and author Jean Kilbourne claimed, “ads are aimed at the very heart of girls’insecurities’\nbecause of the ideal image of beauty that they portray: ‘an absolutely perfect-looking young\nwoman who’s incredibly thin’.”7\nDo you think advertising sends this message? Messages that only feature thin models nor-\nmalize the thin ideal of beauty. Young women and even men can become obsessed with their\nweight to the point that they believe they are attractive only if they are unnaturally thin. The\n“Dove Campaign for Real Beauty” that you’ll read about in Chapter 5 defies the notion that\nwomen need to be thin to be beautiful.\n68 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nA PRINCIPLED PRACTICE\nPizza, Tacos, and Truck Parts:\nSex in Advertising\nHerbert Jack Rotfeld,Professor of Marketing, Auburn University\nAn advertisement for a but when many of his customers forgot his company\npizza place near a col- name or “lost” his phone number, he finally realized\nlege campus ran an that the secretaries and office managers who gave\nadvertisement in the the truckers the necessary purchase order forms\nschool paper that would never allow such lewd displays on their office\nread, “Put a hot walls.\npiece between your The misplaced marketing problem is more than\nlips.
