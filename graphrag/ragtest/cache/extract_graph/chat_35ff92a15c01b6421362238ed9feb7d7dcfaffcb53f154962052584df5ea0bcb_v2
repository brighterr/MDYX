Evaluation research\nMarket Information Formal research used by the marketing department for strategic planning\nis called marketing research. It includes surveys, in-depth interviews, observational methods,\nfocus groups (which are like in-depth interviews with a group rather than individuals), and all\ntypes of primary and secondary data used to develop a marketing plan and ultimately provide in-\nformation for a brand communication plan. Asubset of marketing research, market researchis re-\nsearch used to gather information about a particular market.\nAn example comes from Iceland, a country hard hit by the global economic downturn that\nstarted in 2007. As explained by Ingvi Logason, principal in his own advertising firm in Reyk-\njavik, “Iceland, with its overexpanded banking sector, was hit worse than any other Westernized\ncountry.” With all of its banks except one going into bankruptcy or only barely being saved by\nserious rescue activities by the government, national debt outweighed gross national production\nby 2 to 1. Iceland was on the brink of national bankruptcy. The Inside Storydetails how Logason\nand his agency guided his client, the lamb industry, through this difficult time.\nMarket information includes everything a planner can uncover about consumer perceptions\nof the brand, product category, and competitors’brands. Planners sometimes ride with the sales\nforce and listen to sales pitches, tour manufacturing plants to see how a product is made, and work\nin a store or restaurant to evaluate employee interaction with customers. In terms of marketing\ncommunication, planners test the brand’s and its competitors’advertisements, promotions, retail\ndisplays, packaging, and other marketing communication efforts.\nBrand information includes an assessment of the brand’s role and performance in the\nmarketplace—is it a leader, a follower, a challenger, or a subbrand of a bigger and better\nknown brand? This research also investigates how people perceive brand personalities and\nimages. Here are some common methods used to gather information about a brand and the\nmarketplace:\n• The Brand ExperienceWhen an agency gets a new client, the first thing the agency team\nhas to do is learn about the brand through brand research. That means learning where the\nbrand has been in the past in terms of the market, its customers, and competitors, as the\nCheetos campaign demonstrated. Also important is eliciting the corporate point of view re-\ngarding the brand’s position within the company’s line of products, as well as corporate\ngoals and plans for the brand. Another critical area of brand research is the brand’s relation-\nships with its customers. Researchers, for example, may go through all of the experiences\n170 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nTHE INSIDE STORY\nHow the Lamb Industry in Iceland\nSurvived the Economic Downturn\nIngvi Logason,Principal, H:N Marketing Communication, Reykjavik, Iceland\nIn 2009 (when this was written) the\nwhole world was facing proba-\nbly its greatest economic crisis\nsince the early 20th century.\nThis recession hit the Icelandic\npublic suddenly and it hit\nhard—obliterating purchasing\npower. Overnight the situation\nchanged the way Icelanders\nsearch and shop, as well as what\nthey want from their brands. In this\nmarket planners had to truly understand the\nrole a brand plays in the lives of its target audience clar-\nifying “what’s in it for me” in all communication.\nOne brand that my marketing communication firm\nhas handled and had to adapt to the changed market is\nIcelandic Lamb. Traditionally lamb had been around a\n29 percent share of Icelandic meat consumption with\nheavy and almost exclusive emphasis on the prime (and\nmore expensive) parts of the lamb. That left farmers with\na high percentage of the lamb unsold. Now lamb was\ndown to a 26 percent share and falling.\nAnyone could see that this was not a good situation\nwith the sharp decrease in purchasing power leading to\nfewer sales in luxury and expensive food items. Further-\nmore, sales figures showed that consumers were not go-\ning for the less expensive cuts of lamb, but rather opting\nfor other cheaper meat products. Although we were\nquick to catch the trend and see the possible sales de-\ncline, we were not sure why sales hadn’t moved to less\nexpensive lamb cuts.\nWe assembled focus groups to determine the un-\nderlying problem. With clever probing, the main prob-\nlem became clear: consumers simply did not know how\nto prepare the less costly parts—it was a forgotten art.\nLamb had become such a luxury item\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
