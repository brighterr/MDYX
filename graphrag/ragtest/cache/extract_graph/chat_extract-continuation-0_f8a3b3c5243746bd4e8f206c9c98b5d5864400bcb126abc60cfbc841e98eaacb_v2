Procter & Gamble accomplished that\nby creating identity elements for its soap brand Ivory be-\nfore anyone had thought of making a bar of soap a dis-\ntinctive product. The Ivory brand identity system also\ncalled attention to innovative features of the product.\nHere’s the background story about how Ivory came to be\none of the first and most successful brands of all time.\nBefore the Civil War, homemakers made their own\nsoap from lye, fats (cooking grease), and fireplace ashes.\nIt was a soft, jelly-like, yellowish soap that would clean\nthings adequately, but if it fell to the bottom of a pail, it\ndissolved into mush. In Victorian times, the benchmark\nfor quality soap was the highly expensive castile bar—a\npure white soap imported from the Mediterranean and\nmade from the finest olive oil.\nWilliam Procter and James Gamble, who were part-\nners in a candle-making operation, discovered a formula\nthat produced a uniform, predictable bar soap, which\nthey provided in wooden boxes to both armies during\nthe Civil War. This introduced the concept of mass pro-\nduction and opened up a huge market when the soldiers\nreturned to their homes with a demand for the bars of\nsoap. But back at home the bars of soap were still yellow\nand sunk to the bottom.\nProcter & Gamble hired a chemist to create a white\nbar equivalent to the legendary castile bar. The chemist’s\nwork represented the first time scientific-based research\nand development (R&D) was used to design a product.\nchurch listening to a scripture about ivory palaces and\nIn 1878 P&G white soap was invented. It was a modest\nproposed that the white bar be renamed Ivory Soap.\nsuccess until the company began getting requests for\nNow the great product had a great name as well as a\nthe “soap that floats.” One legend is that a worker in\ngreatproductbenefit.Ratherthanaskingforsoap—soap\n1879 accidentally left the soap-mixing machine operat-\nwas soap—and taking a bar from the barrel, customers\ning during lunch, resulting in an unusually frothy mixture.\ncouldnowaskforaspecificproducttheylikedbyname.\nRecent research, however, has found that James Gamble\nBut that wasn’t the end of P&G’s branding innova-\nmay have always intended for Ivory to float.

In 1879 one of the P&G family was in\nfound that the total impurities in Ivory added up to only\n0.56 percent, which was actually lower than that of the\ncastile bars. By turning that into a positive, Harley Proc-\nter wrote the legendary slogan that Ivory is “99 and\n44/100 percent pure.” Thus was born a pledge of qual-\nity that became one of the most famous brand slogans\nin marketing history.\nNote:To read more about the history of this famous brand, check out\nwww.ivory.com/purefun_history.htm.\nSources:Charles Goodrum and Helen Dalrymple, Advertising in America,\nNew York: Harry N.
