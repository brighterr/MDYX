What ads can you remember seeing? Do you re-\nmember to buy a new product in the store after you’ve see some advertising that intrigues you?\nDo you have favorite ads? These are all important questions to advertising professionals, as well\nas to students, professors, and critics of advertising. In this chapter we’ll try to answer these ques-\ntions about how advertising and other marketing communications work by looking at the effects\nbehind the concept of effectiveness.We are introducing effectiveness now because understanding\nCHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 99\nhow marketing communication works is a foundation for discussions in the following chapters\non consumer behavior, consumer research, and strategic planning. It’s our view that you can’t\nmake intelligent decisions in those areas unless you have some understanding of how marketing\ncommunication works.\nIn this chapter we’ll first consider advertising as communication. Then we’ll look at various\ntypes of consumer responses to messages to identify the key effects, which we organize and pre-\nsent as the Facets Model of Effects. This chapter, then, lays the groundwork for our explanation\nof effectiveness, which is an important theme in this book.\nDOES ADVERTISING WORK?\nWould it surprise you to know that a lot of professionals, as well as academics, are really not sure\nhow advertising works—or even if it works well at all? This is even more of a problem for the\nnew digital media and other forms of marketing communication.\nThis classic quote attributed to Philadelphia department store baron John Wanamaker in the\nearly 1900s sums up the issue: “I know half my advertising is wasted, but I don’t know which\nhalf.” (You can find his quotes and others about the impact of advertising on the Advertising Hall\nof Fame website, www.advertisinghalloffame.org/members.)\nWanamaker is more positive than some advertising experts. The chairman of a British pro-\nmotions company estimated that only about 1 percent of the average campaign spending actually\nworks because few people are aware of ad messages, and of those who are aware, few actually\ndo anything in response.1Research by retired Syracuse University professor John Philip Jones,\nwho worked for many years at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, led him to conclude\nthat only 41 percent of advertising actually works in terms of producing sales.2\nOf course, many professionals, including the managers of big global brands and big adver-\ntising agencies, absolutely believe that advertising works both in the short term to create sales and\nin the long term to build brands. After all, advertising is an $80 billion industry3—even larger\nwhen you consider all of the various related areas of marketing communication.\nTheproblemisthatalotofpoorlyexecutedadvertisingdoesn’tcommunicatewelltoits\nintendedaudienceorhavetheimpactitscreatorsdesired.Solet’sbeginourdiscussionofhow\nadvertisingandmarketingcommunication*workbylookinginmoredepthatitscommunica-\ntionrole.\nHOW DOES MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORK?\nAdvertising and other forms of marketing communication are first of all a form of communica-\ntion, messages that are designed to have some type of impact. In a sense, effective advertising is\na message to a consumer about a brand. It gets attention and provides information, sometimes\neven a bit of entertainment as the Ford SYNC campaign demonstrated. It is purposeful in that it\nseeks to create some kind of response, such as an inquiry, a sale, a visit to a website, or in the case\nof Ford’s SYNC, a test drive.\nThe legendary David Ogilvy would like to see advertising as relevant as a personal conver-\nsation.4He pretends he is at a dinner party and the woman next to him asks for advice. He ex-\nplains, “I give her the facts, facts, facts. I try to make it interesting, fascinating, if possible, and\npersonal—I don’t write to the crowd.”\nIn reality, however, most traditional advertising is not as personal or as interactive as a con-\nversation because it relies on mass communication. Although other forms of marketing commu-\nnication, such as personal selling and telemarketing, can deliver the personal contact of a\nconversation, Ogilvy’s comparison ignores the challenge of getting the attention of a largely dis-\ninterested audience when using mass communication. So let’s look first at how communication\nworks in general and then we’ll apply that analysis to mass media advertising and finally to the\nbroader arena of brand communication.\n*Note: It’s simpler to just say “advertising,” but in this chapter we are referring to advertising as well as the more gen-\neral area of marketing communication.\n100 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nFIGURE 4.1A\nA Basic Mass Communication Model\nThe Mass Communication Approach\nMass communication is a process, as depicted in the model in Figure 4.1a, which outlines the im-\nportant players and steps. The SMCR modeldiagrams how mass communication works: It be-\ngins with a source(S), a sender who encodes a message(M), or puts it in words and pictures. The\nmessage is presented through channels of communication (C), such as a newspaper, radio, or\nTV. The message is decoded, or interpreted, by the receiver(R), who is the reader, viewer, or lis-\ntener. Feedbackis obtained by monitoring the response of the receiver to the message. The en-\ntire process is complicated by what we refer to as noise, things that interrupt the sending and\nreceiving of the message, such as a bad connection or words with unclear meanings\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
