The word advertisementfirst appeared around 1655, and by\n1660 publishers were using the word as a heading in newspapers for commercial informa-\ntion. These messages announced land for sale, runaways (slaves and servants), transporta-\ntion (ships arriving, stagecoach schedules), and goods for sale from local merchants.\nCHAPTER 1 • THE NEW WORLD OF MARKETING COMMUNICATION 7\nBecause of the importance of commercial information, these ads were\nconsidered news and in many cases occupied more space in early news-\npapers than the news stories.\n• PersuasionAdvertising persuades people to buy things. The Industrial\nRevolution accelerated social change, as well as mass production. It\nbrought the efficiency of machinery not only to the production of goods,\nbut also to their distribution. Efficient production plus wider distribution\nmeant that manufacturers could offer more products than their local\nmarkets could consume. With the development of trains and national\nroads, manufacturers could move their products around the country. For\nwidespread marketing of products, it became important to have a recog-\nnizable brand name, such as Ivory or, more recently, Burger King. Also\nlarge groups of people needed to know about these goods, so along with\nindustrial mechanization and the opening of the frontier came even more\nuse of new communication media, such as magazines, catalogs, and bill-\nboards that reached more people with more enticing forms of persua-\nsion. P. T. Barnum and patent medicine makers were among the\nadvertising pioneers who moved promotion from identification and in-\nformation to a flamboyant version of persuasion called hype—graphics\nand language characterized by exaggeration, or hyperbole.\nOver the years, identification, information, and persuasion have been\nthe basic elements of marketing communication and the focus of adver-\ntising. So how do we define it now realizing that advertising is dynamic\nand constantly changing to meet the demands of society and the market-\nplace? We can summarize a modern view of advertising with the follow-\ning definition:\nAdvertising is a paid form of persuasive communication that uses\nmass and interactive media to reach broad audiences in order to con-\nnect an identified sponsor with buyers (a target audience), provide in-\nformation about products (goods, services, and ideas), and interpret\nthe product features in terms of the customer’s needs and wants.\nThisdefinitionhasanumberofelementsandaswereviewthem,wewillalso\npointoutwherethedefinitionischangingbecauseofnewtechnology,media\nshifts,andculturalchanges.(Anothersourcefordefinitionsintheadvertising\nandmarketingareaistheAmericanMarketingAssociationDictionary,which\nyoucanfindatwww.marketingpower.com/_layouts/Dictionary.aspx.)\nAdvertising is usually paidfor by the advertiser (Burger King, for ex-\nample) who has a product to sell(the Whopper),although some forms of ad-\nvertising, such as public service announcements (PSAs), use donated space\nand time. Not only is the message paid for, but the sponsor is identified. Ad-\nvertising began as one-waycommunication—from an advertiser to a targeted\naudience. Digital media, however, have opened the door to interesting new\nforms of two-way and multiple-way brand-related communication such as CLASSIC\nword-of-mouth conversations among friends or consumer-generated mes- P.

What are the\ning responses became a hit on YouTube when shared among friends.\nother roles they performed?\nAdvertising generally reaches a broad audienceofpotential customers,\neither as a mass audience or in smaller targeted groups. However direct-\nresponse advertising, particularly those practices that involve digital com-\nmunication, has the ability to address individual members of the audience.\nSo some advertising can deliver one-to-onecommunication but with a large\ngroup of people.\nIn traditional advertising, the message is conveyed through different kinds\nof mass media, which are largely nonpersonal messages. This nonpersonal\n8 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\ncharacteristic, however, is changing with the introduction of more interactivetypes of media, as the\nWhopper case demonstrates. Richard Edelman, CEO of the Edelman agency, emphasizes the emerg-\ning importance of word of mouth,which is personal communication through new media forms rather\nthan what he describes as “scripted messages in a paid format.”1\nMost advertising has a defined strategy and seeks to inform consumers and/or make them\nawareof a brand, company, or organization. In many cases, it also tries to persuadeor influence\nconsumers to do something, such as buy a product or check out a brand’s website. Persuasion may\ninvolveemotionalmessages as well as information. In an unusual use of messages tied to feel-\nings, the Burger King “deprivation strategy” was designed to elicit negative responses to com-\npetitors’burgers that were substituted for the Whopper.\nKeep in mind that, as we have said, a product can be a good, service, or idea. Some non-\nprofits, for example, use ads to “sell” memberships, get volunteers and donations, or advocate\ncontroversial positions.\nIs Advertising the Only Tool in the Promotional Toolkit?\nIt’s not the only tool, although it may be the biggest. In the United States, advertising is a $30 bil-\nlion industry.2Advertising often is seen as the driving force in marketing communication because\nit commands the largest budget, as well as the largest number of agencies and professionals.\nTogetanideaofthescopeoftheadvertisingindustry,considerTables1.1and1.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
