Tele-\nphones,ofcourse,startedasahard-wiredhomeandofficedeviceconnectedbyphonelines.With\nthedevelopmentofsatellite-basedandbroadbandtelecommunication,thecellphonehasbecome\nthe all-purpose personal communication tool.

The leaders in the development of these new tools have been Scandinavian\ncountries and Japan; the United States is just catching up with these high-tech countries that have\nbeen using smart phones for years.\nMessages on mobile phones usually look like small banners tucked into the corner of a Web\npage or text messages that can resemble spam. Mobile marketing agency AdMob and Google\nhave designed more visual ads, some even showing maps with a retailer’s location or apps that\nallow users to watch a commercial between levels in a video game.24\nCell phones also launched new product lines such as graphic faceplates and specialty ring\ntones. Female teenagers were leaders in exploring text messaging (TM) on their cell phones\nand teaching others (their parents, older siblings, teachers). Instant messaging (IM),in which\ntwo people chat via their computers, has been used more for business, as has the Bluetooth\ntechnology, which keeps businesspeople in touch with their companies and clients wherever\nthey are.\nIn addition to becoming essential communication, information, and entertainment tools in\nmost people lives, cell phones also open up new avenues for commercial communication.\nMobile marketingis the strategy based on reaching people on the run via their cell phones. It\nrefers to the use of wireless communication (WiFi) and GPS locational devices to reach people\non the move with geotargeting capabilities. The Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) defines\nmobile marketingas the use of wireless media, primarily cellular phones and personal digital as-\nsistants (PDAs), such as RIM’s BlackBerry. But mobile marketing is more than just cell phones\nand PDAs; it also includes laptop computers and even portable game consoles as vehicles that\ncan deliver content and encourage direct response within a cross-media communication pro-\ngram. Mobile marketing includes instant messaging, video messages and downloads, and ban-\nner ads on these mobile devices. The MMA reported that U.S. advertising expenditures on\nmobile marketing increased by more than 20 percent in 2009 and predicted similar increases dur-\ning the 2010s.25\nIt is possible, for example, to send text messages or voice mail with news about special sales\nto people’s cell phones or PDAs that use wireless technology (such as Bluetooth) when these cus-\ntomers are in the vicinity of a favorite store or restaurant. If a cell phone user, for example, regis-\nters with a favorite store, then that store can contact the user when he or she is in the neighborhood.\nThese calls can announce special deals or invite the customer in for a taste test or some other type\nof promotion. If the call is not an opt-in message, then it can be intrusive and irritating. The phones\ncan also be used to contact a store. Pizza Hut and Papa\nJohn’s customers, for example, can use their smart\nphones to place orders and, by dragging and dropping\ntoppings onto virtual pizzas, they can create their own\npersonal pizza. Domino’s features a simulated photo-\ngraphic version on its website that can be customized.26\nAlthough IM/TM advertising—primarily in the\nform of product notices—is big in Japan, it’s still seen as\nan invasion of privacy in the United States. Even with the\nhuge increase in texting, particularly by 18- to 24-year-\nolds (95 percent use texting), it’s a puzzle for marketers\nbecause, as Advertising Agereported, “it is very much a\npermission-based channel of communication.”27\nAsinotherformsofadvertising,thewaytobeless\nintrusiveistobemorerelevantandofferopt-inoptions.\nTeensmaypermitadvertisingifitofferstheminformation\ntheywant,suchasnewsaboutmusic,games,sports,cos-\nmetics,andfashion.InJapan,abarcodecanbesentfora\nThe emerging area of mobile marketing helps companies freesampleorsomeotherpromotion.Likeafreecoupon,\nconnect with customers in new ways and new places. itcanberedeemedwhenacashierscansthecode.\nCHAPTER 11 • MEDIA BASICS 347\nBranded Apps Anapp, short for application,is a piece of software than runs on your computer,\ncell phone, or social networking site.
