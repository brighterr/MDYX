It succeeded in not only getting the men to know about Coke Zero, nearly\nhalf of the target audience of young men 18–34 tried it, too. The campaign was able to increase consumer\nrecognition of the taste similarity message. Four out of 10 people who were interviewed recognized the mes-\nsage that Coke Zero tastes like Coke. The success of achieving the campaign goals is evident.\nYou might ask if this campaign was beneficial for the Coca-Cola company overall. Could it be that it can-\nnibalized its audience by shifting Coke drinkers to Coke Zero drinkers? John D. Sicher, Jr., editor and pub-\nlisher at Beverage Digest, believes the campaign’s effects have been positive. He said, “Forty-five percent of\nCoke Zero sales are incremental rather than borrowed from Diet Coke.”\nBased on the evidence, this nontraditional campaign, and its unconventional message, Coke Zero was\nawarded a Silver Effie for effectiveness.\nCase closed.\nKey Points Summary\n1.What is the difference between objectives,strategies, analysis (background research, SWOTs, key communica-\nand tactics in strategic planning and how are the three tion problem), objectives, targeting, positioning (features,\nlevels of planning connected?Objectives are what you attributes, differentiation, competitive advantage), strategic\nwant to accomplish, or goals; strategies are how you will approach (branding, positioning, category dominance, mar-\naccomplish the objectives, or the design or plan; and tactics keting mix support, consumer response), and campaign\nare the ways in which you implement the strategies, or the management (budgeting, evaluation).\nexecution.
