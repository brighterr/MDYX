Gen. Benjamin C. Freakley, commanding general of U.S. Army Accessions Com-\nmand. “We want our prospects to experience the Army brand in a relevant way, so we infuse experiential op-\nportunities into all of our marketing efforts. That way, our prospects can better understand what it’s really like\nto be a soldier and, therefore, make an informed decision about serving our nation in the Army.” Sgt. Jason\nMike, a Silver Star recipient and one of the “Real Heroes” manning the event at Andrews Air Force Base, said,\n“I hope that everyone who comes through here leaves with a greater appreciation for the Army and our men\nand women in uniform.”\nIn the first three years of its operations, the VAE provided a glimpse of soldiering in the U.S. Army to more\nthan 205,000 unique visitors, and has helped identify more than 112,000 qualified prospects to the sales force.\nIt delivered an event cost per lead that was well below its goal. Importantly, it converted leads to U.S. Army\ncontracts. Of all the qualified leads generated through the VAE program, the conversion rate far exceeded the\nstated goal. According to a 2008 New Recruit Survey Report published by U.S. Army Accessions Command,\nthe VAE became the fifth most attended Army event among new recruits. Pre-event and post-event assess-\nment surveys indicated that negative perceptions of a career in the U.S. Army were significantly dispelled as\nwell. According to the same 2008 survey, U.S. Army Accessions Command also reported that the VAE resulted\nin the highest percentage of positive change in perception of the top Army event marketing programs.\nThe operation was deemed a success as a communication campaign. The U.S. Army has been decorated\nwith numerous awards for this project, including a Silver and Gold Effie for Brand Experience and Government/\nInstitution/Recruitment, respectively.\nKey Points Summary\n1.How does the Internet work,and what roles does it play gines.Socialmediaofferanotherwaypeoplecanstayin\nin marketing communication?Most Internet advertising touchandthatincludescompanieswhousesuchmediaas\nis found on established news media sites that operate as FacebookandTwittertoconnectwiththeircustomers.\nelectronic publishers, such as www.nytimes.com,www 3.In what ways are Internet practices,issues,and trends\n.WSJ.com,andwww.ESPN.com,as well as on major search evolving?Important Internet practices that have emerged\nengines and service providers, such as Google and Yahoo!. include the need for offline advertising for websites and\nThe roles played by Internet communication include pro- new forms of brand experiences on the Web.
