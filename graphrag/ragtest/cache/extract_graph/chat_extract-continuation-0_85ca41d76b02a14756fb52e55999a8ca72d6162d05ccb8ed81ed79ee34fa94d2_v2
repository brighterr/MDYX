Both the chain and the manu-\nfacturers of the brands are interested in this data. The re-\ngional Safeway system may decide to establish a\nconsumer panel so it can track sales among various con-\nsumer groups. In scanner research,you would be asked\nto join a panel, which might contain hundreds of other\ncustomers. You would complete a fairly extensive ques-\ntionnaire and be assigned an ID number. You might re-\nceive a premium or a discount on purchases for your\nparticipation. Each time you make a purchase, you also\nsubmit your ID number. Therefore, if Safeway runs a\ntwo-page newspaper ad, it can track actual sales to deter-\nmine to what extent the ad worked. Various manufactur-\ners who sell products to Safeway can do the same kind of Scanner research reads the information from a shopper’s\ntesting.

His research has found that the\nstrongest campaigns can triple sales, while the weakest campaigns can actually cause sales to fall\nby more than 50 percent.14\nAlthough fairly expensive, single-source research can produce dependable results. Adver-\ntisements are received under natural conditions in the home, and the resulting purchases are ac-\ntual purchases made by consumers. One drawback, besides cost, is the three to six months\nrequired to set up and run this test. Critics also say that single-source research is better for short-\nterm immediate sales effects and doesn’t capture very well other brand-building effects.\nMEDIA EVALUATION\nAdvertisinghaslittlechancetobeeffectiveifnooneseesit.Analyzingtheeffectivenessofthe\nmediaplanisanotherimportantpartofevaluation.Didtheplanactuallyachievereachandfre-\nquencyobjectives?Didthenewspaperandmagazineplacementsruninthepositionsexpected\nandproducetheintendedGRPandCPMlevels?Inotherwords,didtheadvertisersgetwhatthey\npaidfor?\nA classic case of the power of media, particularly the repetition of commercials, is the\n“Please Don’t Squeeze the Charmin” campaign that began in 1964.
