Ads in newspapers and magazines\ncan carry a coupon, an order form, an address, or a toll-free or 900 telephone number. The re-\nsponse may be either to purchase something or to ask for more information. In many cases the\ndesired response is an inquiry that becomes a sales lead for field representatives.\n502 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nAclassic example of the power of direct-response\nadvertising is the “97-Pound Weakling” ads for the\nCharles Atlas body building mail-order courses that fea-\ntured a cartoon telling the story of a scrawny guy who\ndecides to bulk up after a well-built lifeguard kicks sand\nin his face and steals his girlfriend. The business was\nlaunched in 1928 when Atlas partnered with adman\nCharles Roman to promote the Charles Atlas exercise\nsystem and correspondence course. The campaign cre-\nated a multimillion-dollar business and the “97-pound\nweakling” who turned into a “he man” became a pop\nculture icon.\nCatalogs also have been effective direct-response\nmarketers for as long as there has been mail. The famous\nSears catalogs began in 1888 with a line of watches and\njewelry. In 1894 the offerings were expanded to include\nsewing machines, bicycles, saddles, musical instru-\nments and a host of new items. In 1896 the slogan\n“Cheapest Supply House on Earth” was added to the\ncover. For more on the history of this iconic direct-re-\nsponse vehicle, visit http://www.searsarchives.com/.\nBroadcast Media Adirect-response commercial on ra-\ndio or TVcan provide the necessary information (usu-\nally a simple, easy-to-remember toll-free phone number\nor Web address) for the consumer to request information\nor even make a purchase. Radio’s big advantage is its\nhighly targeted audience. In contrast, television is a\ngood medium for direct marketers who are advertising a\nbroadly targeted product.\nDirect-response advertising on television used to\nCLASSIC\nbe the province of late-night TVwith pitches for Vege-\nFor most of its life, the Sears catalog was sent to homes via the\nmatics and screwdrivers guaranteed to last a lifetime. As\nPostal Service and shoppers could order directly from the “Wish\nmore national marketers, such as GEICO, move into the\nbook” with their merchandise also delivered to them by mail. Some\nmedium, the direct-response commercial is becoming\nsurprising offerings included the Sears Motor buggy from 1909 to\nmore general in appeal, selling clothes and entertain-\n1912 and from 1908 to 1940 Sears sold some 75,000 mail-order\nhomes from its catalogs. ment as well as insurance and financial services.\nDirect-response TV also makes good use of the\ninfomercial format. Infomercials blur the lines be-\ntween retail and direct response. Infomercials have\nbeen around since the emergence of the cable industry and have become a multibillion-dollar\nindustry. An infomercial is typically 30 or 60 minutes long and tends to be played during non-\nprime-time periods. The Salton-Maxim Juiceman infomercial took the company from $18 mil-\nlion to $52 million in sales overnight and made a marketing superstar of George Foreman. The\nSalton commercial made Juiceman the brand to buy, whether direct from television or from a\nlocal department store or mass merchant.\nToday, the infomercial is viewed as a viable medium because (1) consumers now have con-\nfidence in infomercials and the products they sell; (2) with the involvement of upscale advertis-\ners, the quality of infomercial production and supportive research has improved; (3) consumers\ncan be better segmented and infomercials are coordinated with respect to these audiences; and\n(4) infomercials can easily be introduced into foreign markets. Marketers are more likely to use\nthe infomercial format if their product needs to be demonstrated, is not readily available through\nretail outlets, and has a relatively high profit margin.\nTelebrands, a direct-response TV (DRTV) marketer, for many years used pitchman Billy\nMays until he died in 2009. Using a reality show format, the company offered tryouts for the\nMays replacement. Even AdAgecolumnist Larry Dobrow tried out for the position. Mays was\nthe undisputed king of TVpitching and sold as much as 70 percent of the gadgets offered on air.\nCHAPTER 16 • DIRECT RESPONSE 503\nA leading direct-response auto insurer, GEICO uses its Gecko character as a spokes-creature to sell its products on\ntelevision, as well as in print.\nThe Telebrands president admitted that “you can double the response with the right pitch person\nvs. no pitch person.”12\nCable television lends itself to direct response because the medium is more tightly targeted\nto particular interests. QVC and the Home Shopping Network reach more than 70 million house-\nholds and service their calls with huge phone banks.\nThe Internet and New Forms of Direct Response\nDirectmarketerssawtheInternet’spotentialearly.Actually,directmarketing—particularlycata-\nlogmarketing—isthemodelfore-commerce.Amazon.comistheleaderofthepack,butothercom-\npaniesthatsellmerchandisedirectincludeColumbiaHouseOnline(www.columbiahouse.com),\neBags (www.eBags.com), and CDNow (www\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHARLES ATLAS<|>PERSON<|>Charles Atlas was a bodybuilder who launched a mail-order bodybuilding course in 1928, becoming a pop culture icon through direct-response advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARLES ROMAN<|>PERSON<|>Charles Roman was an adman who partnered with Charles Atlas to promote the Charles Atlas exercise system and correspondence course)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEARS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sears is a retail company known for its iconic catalogs that began in 1888, offering a wide range of products and pioneering direct-response marketing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEICO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GEICO is a leading direct-response auto insurer known for using its Gecko character in advertising to sell insurance products)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TELEBRANDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Telebrands is a direct-response TV marketer known for using pitchmen like Billy Mays to sell products on television)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILLY MAYS<|>PERSON<|>Billy Mays was a famous TV pitchman who sold a significant portion of gadgets on air for Telebrands until his death in 2009)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGE FOREMAN<|>PERSON<|>George Foreman is a marketing superstar known for his association with the Salton-Maxim Juiceman infomercial, which significantly boosted sales)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QVC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>QVC is a cable television network that specializes in home shopping and direct-response marketing, reaching over 70 million households)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOME SHOPPING NETWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Home Shopping Network is a cable television network that specializes in home shopping and direct-response marketing, reaching over 70 million households)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON.COM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amazon.com is a leading e-commerce company that sells merchandise directly to consumers, modeled after catalog marketing)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARLES ATLAS<|>CHARLES ROMAN<|>Charles Atlas partnered with Charles Roman to promote the Charles Atlas exercise system<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEARS<|>GEORGE FOREMAN<|>Sears and George Foreman are both associated with successful direct-response marketing campaigns<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEICO<|>TELEBRANDS<|>Both GEICO and Telebrands use direct-response advertising to reach consumers<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TELEBRANDS<|>BILLY MAYS<|>Billy Mays was a pitchman for Telebrands, significantly boosting their sales<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QVC<|>HOME SHOPPING NETWORK<|>QVC and the Home Shopping Network are both cable television networks specializing in home shopping and direct-response marketing<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMAZON.COM<|>SEARS<|>Amazon.com and Sears both utilize direct-response marketing strategies, with Amazon.com being a leader in e-commerce<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
