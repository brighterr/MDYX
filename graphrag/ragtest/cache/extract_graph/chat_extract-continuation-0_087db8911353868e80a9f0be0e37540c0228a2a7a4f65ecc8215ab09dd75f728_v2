Public opinion,the term describing what\na group of people thinks, expresses beliefs based on their experiences with people, events, insti-\ntutions, or products.\nThe public relations strategist researches the answers to two primary questions about public\nopinion to design effective public relations programs. First, which publics are most important to\nthe organization, now and in the future? Second, what do these publics think? Public opinion is\nsometimes confused with mass opinion. Public opinion differs from mass opinion in that public\nopinion examines specific subgroups rather than a more general mass audience. Particular em-\nphasis falls on understanding the role for each of the publics of opinion leaders,important peo-\nple who influence the opinions of others\nReputation: Goodwill, Trust, and Integrity\nPublic goodwill is the greatest asset any organization can have. Awell-informed public with a\npositive attitude toward an organization is critical to the organization’s survival—and that is why\ncreating goodwill is the primary goal of most public relations programs.\nSometimes a totally unexpected crisis can threaten an organization’s respect and trust. For\nexample, managers at Domino’s Pizza had to deal with two employees in a North Carolina store\nwho thought it would be funny to post a YouTube video of themselves messing with ingredients—\nthink “mozzarella curl in the nostril” and “sneezing on a salami.” It wasn’t real funny to the com-\npany when it had to place ads nationwide apologizing for the antics of the two.3\nBeyond responding to immediate issues, a public relations program that is tuned to creating\nPrinciple\ngoodwill operates as the conscience of the organization. Creating goodwill demands that both\nPublic relations is the\npublic relations professionals and the clients they represent act with integrity. Howard Ruben- conscience of the company,\nstein, an elder statesman in public relations, advises clients and colleagues that deliberately de- with the objective of\nceiving is “a career limiting move.” He has a paperweight in his office at his agency to remind creating trust and\nhim, “If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.”4 maintaining the\nTo underscore the importance of acting ethically as a prerequisite for creating goodwill, pub- organization’s integrity.\nlic relations organizations have created codes of ethics, which encourage ethical behavior of in-\ndustry members. The Public Relations Society of America’s Code of Professional Standards for\nthe Practice of Public Relationsspells out core values of conduct, such as truth, accuracy, fair-\nness, and responsibility to the public. It also includes specific provisions regarding the free flow\nof information, fair competition, disclosure of information, protection of confidential and private\ninformation, and avoidance of conflicts of interest.5Other industry organizations, such as the In-\nternational Association of Business Communicators (IABC) and the Council of Public Relations\nFirms, offer similar codes.\nIt is critical for public relations professionals to act ethically. It is equally important for the\nclients and organizations they represent to act with integrity. The trust on which goodwill is based\ncomes from corporate integrity. One communication expert who has experience with multinational\n462 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\ncorporations and the U.S. State Department contends that corporate reputation and corporate re-\nsponsibility are inseparable.6\nAreputation for integrity involves more than image. Image is a perception based on mes-\nPrinciple\nsages delivered by advertising and other marketing communication tools. Reputation, however,\nReputation is earned\nbased on what you do, is based on an organization’s actual behavior. Image mirrors what a company says about itself,\nnot on what you say about but reputation reflects what other people say about the company.7\nyourself. The value of a good reputation is difficult to measure. Although considered a soft asset,one\nthat is not usually included in a company’s financial statement, it can be significant in determin-\ning company and brand value. The lack of a good reputation can be devastatingly costly, as British\nPetroleum discovered after weeks, even months, of trying to deal with an oil leak in the Gulf of\nMexico and its decision to reimburse businesses harmed by the spill.\nComparing Public Relations and Advertising\nDesigning ads, preparing written messages, and buying time or space are the key concerns of ad-\nvertisers. Their objective is to create the consumer awareness and motivation that deliver sales.\nThe goal of public relations specialists is communicating with various stakeholders, managing\nthe organization’s image and reputation, creating positive public attitudes, and building strong re-\nlationships between the organization and its constituents.\nUltimately, the difference between advertising and public relations is that public relations\ntakes a longer, broader view of the importance of image and reputation as a corporate competi-\ntive asset and addresses more target audiences. Public relations and advertising also differ in how\nthey use the media, the level of control they have over message delivery, and their perceived cred-\nibility. Daniel Edelman, founder and chairman of Daniel J. Edelman, Inc., a major public rela-\ntions firm, describes this as the “golden age of public relations,” in part because of the many ways\nPR engages with its publics who are active participants in the\ncommunication process.8Here are some specific differences\nbetween public relations and advertising:\n• Media UseIn contrast to buying advertising time and\nspace, public relations people seek to persuade media\ngatekeepers to carry stories about their company.\nGatekeepersinclude writers, producers, editors, talk-\nshow coordinators, and newscasters. Although public re-\nlations has a distinguished tradition, people often\nmistake it for publicity,which\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DOMINO'S PIZZA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Domino's Pizza is a well-known pizza delivery and carryout chain that had to manage a public relations crisis due to inappropriate behavior by employees<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOWARD RUBENSTEIN<|>PERSON<|>Howard Rubenstein is a respected figure in public relations known for advising clients on ethical practices<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC RELATIONS SOCIETY OF AMERICA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Public Relations Society of America is an organization that provides a code of ethics for public relations professionals<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BUSINESS COMMUNICATORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The International Association of Business Communicators is an organization that offers ethical guidelines for business communicators<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COUNCIL OF PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Council of Public Relations Firms is an organization that provides ethical standards for public relations firms<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DANIEL J.
