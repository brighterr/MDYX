C. Nielsen is the research company that dominates the television measurement industry.\nExposure is television’s equivalent to circulation. Exposure measures households with sets\nturned on, a population referred to as households using television (HUT). But a HUT figure\ndoesn’t tell you if anyone is watching the program. Remember from Chapter 11that we defined\nanimpressionas one person’s opportunity to be exposed one time to an ad. Like print, the im-\npressions from television—the number of viewers exposed to a program—might be greater than\nthe number of households reached since there may be more than one viewer watching and the\nCHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 379\ncommercial may be repeated several times in a program or during a time period. We add all of\nthese impressions up and call them gross impressions.\nFor television programs, the exposure is estimated in terms of number of viewers. The 2010\nSuper Bowl was watched by 106 million people, making it the most watched telecast ever, sur-\npassing the viewership of the 1983 M*A*S*H final episode. Following those programs, the 1996\nDallas vs. Pittsburgh Super Bowl game drew 97 million viewers and the 2007 Super Bowl fea-\nturing the Chicago Bears and Indianapolis Colts, attracted some 93 million viewers.\n• RatingsThesegrossimpressionfiguresbecomeverylargeanddifficulttoworkwith,\nwhichiswhythetelevisionindustry,similartoradio,usesratings(percentageofexposure)\ninstead.Ratingsareaneasiermeasurementtoworkwithbecausetheyconverttherawfig-\nuretoapercentage.Whenyoureadaboutatelevisionshowhavingaratingof20that\nmeansthat20percent,orone-fifthofallhouseholdswithtelevisions,weretunedintothat\nprogram.Notethatoneratingpointequals1percentofthenation’sestimated114million\nTVhomes;that’swhyplannersdescribethisprogramashaving20ratingpoints,orper-\ncentagepoints.A20ratingisactuallyahugefigure,sincethefragmentationofcablehas\ndiversifiedtelevisionwatchingandmadeitverydifficulttoget20percentofthehouse-\nholdstunedtoanyoneprogram.\n• ShareAbetter estimate of impressions might be found in a program’s share of audience,\nwhich refers to the percent of viewers based on the number of sets turned on during a spe-\ncific broadcast period. The share figure for a particular program is always larger than its rat-\ning, since the base is smaller. For example, if the Super Bowl gets a rating of 40 (40 percent\nof all households with television), its share would be 67 if the total HUTwas 60 percent. In\nother words, the Super Bowl has 2/3 (40 divided by 60 (cid:4)67) of all households that have\ntheir television sets turned on during the Super Bowl.\nIndependent rating firms, such as A. C. Nielsen, provide the most commonly used measure\nof national and local television audiences. Nielsen periodically samples a portion of the televi-\nsion viewing audience, estimates the size and characteristics of the audiences watching specific\nshows, and then makes these data available, for a fee, to advertisers and ad agencies, which use\nthem in their media planning.\nNielsen’s calculations are based on audience data from about 5,000 measurement instru-\nments, called people meters,which record what television shows are being watched, the number\nof households that are watching, and which family members are viewing. The recording is done\nautomatically; household members indicate their presence by pressing a button. These are placed\nin randomly selected households in the 210 television markets in the United States. The company\nalso uses viewer diaries mailed out during the sweepsperiod, which are quarterly periods when\nmore extensive audience data and demographics are gathered. About 1 million diaries are re-\nturned each year.\nNielsen continues to add people meters in its top markets to track local viewing patterns. Meters\nare used only to determine what show is being watched, and not the specific demographics of\nwho is watching it. Demographic data come from diaries. Anew locally based meter system\nwould allow Nielsen to identify the age, race, and sex of viewers on a nightly basis. Note that\nthese ratings are based on programs, and are not measures of specific advertisements.\nOne interesting finding from an analysis of ratings is that even in this age of DVRs, the lead-\nin show does matter. Fox’s American Idol, for example, has been a strong lead-in to other Fox shows\nsuch as Fringe. Another Nielsen finding during the recent recession is the power of ethnic media.\nFor example, the number one TVstation in Los Angeles isn’t one of the networks, it’s Spanish-lan-\nguage KMEX. And it’s not just LA’s top station, Nielsen ranks it as the number one station in the\nUnited States with viewers ages 18 to 49.33\nSomething not measured by all of these metrics is the dedication of a program’s superfans.\nWhen NBC proposed dropping Chuck, fans launched a campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and TV\nblogs in defense of their favorite program. Realizing the significance of the attachment, Subway\njumped in as an ally. To demonstrate the marketing power of ChuckTV.net, a consumer-generated\ncampaign called “Finale & Footlong” urged fans to buy foot-long sandwiches from Subway to\neat as they watched the season finale. The effort was successful, and NBC announced it would\nrenew the show.34\n380 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nTelevision Advertising\nThe first\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>A.
