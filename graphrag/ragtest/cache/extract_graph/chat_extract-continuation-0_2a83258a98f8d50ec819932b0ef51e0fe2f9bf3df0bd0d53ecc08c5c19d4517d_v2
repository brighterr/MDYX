How are IMC tools,campaigns,and programs evaluated?\nThe Colorado Pass—The Coolest Club\non the Slopes!*\nHere’s the problem: How do you not only maintain share of market but in-\ncrease business for a ski resort in a competitive landscape? I work for Vail\nResorts and that’s one of our biggest challenges.\nAlthough the business from the destination market is important to the finan-\ncial health of the company, so are season passes. Season-pass sales are a signifi-\ncant contributor to the bottom line and provide revenue stability by locking in\nrevenue early in the ski season. Lift ticket revenue is 35 percent of all company rev-\nenue; season passes represent approximately 33 percent of that lift ticket revenue.\nIn fact, most season passes are purchased before the season even begins. How-\never, season-pass purchases are conducted in a very competitive environment be-\ncause our resorts go up against other Colorado resorts to secure the largest share\nof the 5 million skiers in the local market.\nOur company is in a unique position to attract skiers and snowboarders be-\ncause of its five mountains—Vail, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge, Keystone, Heavenly-\nLake Tahoe—and Arapahoe Basin (a partner resort). Our largest competitors in\nColorado, where competition is the fiercest, include Copper Mountain, Winter Park,\nAspen, and Steamboat Springs. The company offers a few different types of season\npasses, but we’ll focus on the Colorado Pass™, our marquee pass.\nOne of our strengths is our robust customer databases, which contain trans-\nactional information (a history of products purchased) and traditional marketing in-\nformation. The combination of the two permits very strong database segmentation\nfor e-mail and direct-mail efforts. We also track revenue generated from those ef-\nforts so that we can assess their ROIs and strengthen the next campaign. We can\nalso tell if a guest has booked a trip or purchased a product through our e-mails or\ndirect mail and can ensure that they aren’t served up the same message again—\nkeeping our communication effective and meaningful.\nVail Resorts has more than 500,000 total e-mail\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PINNACLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pinnacle is a brand known for producing upscale pens in Switzerland, featuring long-lasting cartridges and various forms and widths)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOM<|>PERSON<|>Tom is involved in a business venture with Wendy, focusing on marketing strategies for their new business)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WENDY<|>PERSON<|>Wendy is involved in a business venture with Tom, focusing on marketing strategies for their new business)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRANDREVIVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BrandRevive is a client for whom a campaign is being developed, focusing on integrated brand communication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CENTURY COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Century Council is involved in a campaign called \"The Stupid Drink\" aimed at increasing consistency and impact)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAIL RESORTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vail Resorts is a company managing multiple ski resorts, focusing on increasing market share and season-pass sales)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLORADO<|>GEO<|>Colorado is a competitive market for ski resorts, where Vail Resorts competes with other resorts for skiers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLORADO PASS<|>EVENT<|>The Colorado Pass is a marquee season pass offered by Vail Resorts, contributing significantly to their revenue)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOM<|>WENDY<|>Tom and Wendy are partners in a business venture, discussing marketing strategies<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VAIL RESORTS<|>COLORADO<|>Vail Resorts competes in the Colorado market against other ski resorts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VAIL RESORTS<|>COLORADO PASS<|>Vail Resorts offers the Colorado Pass as a key product to attract skiers and snowboarders<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
