In the Frontier Airlines talking animals\ncommercials, for example, the repartee between the characters is as important to the message as\nthe words themselves. Note how the dialogue between Jack the Rabbit and Larry the Lynx\nbounces back and forth in the “Leather Seats” commercial. Also note the brand identity text in\nthe middle. This structure is called a “donut” because it uses an attention-getting idea to open and\nclose with brand copy embedded in the middle.\nJack the Rabbit: I’ll tell you, Lar, the tarmac never looked better.\nLarry the Lynx: I’ll say.\nJack: New planes. New cities. New leather seats.\nLarry: Pretty exciting stuff, huh?\nJack: Hey, uh, Larry, what’s leather made from?\nLarry: Cowhide.\nJack: Oh. So that’s why there are no cows on the tails of our planes.\nLarry: It’d be creepy.\nGRAPHIC: New planes. New cities. New leather seats.\n[MUSIC UNDER] Awhole different animal. FrontierAirlines.com. Frontier.\nLarry: Wanna moment of silence for the cows?\nJack: Sure.\nBoth: That’s enough.\nJack: Wanna grab a burger?\nLarry: I’m starving.\nSource:Courtesy of Frontier Airlines and Grey Worldwide.\nMusic is also important in most commercials. Sometimes it is just used as background; at\nother times, the song is the focus of the commercial. In recognition of the role of music in adver-\ntising, Universal Music released a CD in 2001 called “As Seen on TV: Songs from Commercials,”\na collection of tunes that have become popular—or resurrected—thanks to their use in TVcom-\nmercials. Included among the 20 songs are “Mr. Roboto” by Styx, “Right Here, Right Now” by\nFatboy Slim, “Lust for Life” by Iggy Pop, and “Got to Give It Up” by Marvin Gaye. All of these\nsongs have been used effectively in a television commercial. Clash’s “London Calling” song be-\ncame the theme for a highly successful sales event for Jaguar.\nOther TV Tools The creative tools examined next are the setting, casting, costumes, props, and\nlighting—all of which the copywriter must describe in the script. The setting, or set,is where the\naction takes place. It can be something in the studio, from a simple tabletop to a constructed set\nthat represents a storefront or the inside of a home, or it can be a computer creation layered\nbehind the action. Commercials shot outside the studio are said to be filmed on location,which\nmeans the entire crew and cast are transported somewhere away from the studio.\nFor many commercials, the most important element is the people, who are called talent.\nFinding the right person for each role is called casting.People can be cast as:\n• Announcers(either onstage or offstage), presenters, introducers.\n• Spokespersons(or“spokes-animals,”suchastheGeicoGeckoand\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SUSAN BOYLE<|>PERSON<|>Susan Boyle is a Scottish singer who gained fame after her performance on Britain's Got Talent, which defied audience expectations and created a strong emotional impact)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRITAIN'S GOT TALENT<|>EVENT<|>Britain's Got Talent is a television talent show where Susan Boyle's performance became a pivotal moment, showcasing her unexpected singing talent)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMON COWELL<|>PERSON<|>Simon Cowell is a judge on Britain's Got Talent known for his initial cynicism towards Susan Boyle's performance, which contributed to the dramatic narrative of her story)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRONTIER AIRLINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Frontier Airlines is an airline company known for its commercials featuring talking animals like Jack the Rabbit and Larry the Lynx)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACK THE RABBIT<|>PERSON<|>Jack the Rabbit is a character in Frontier Airlines commercials, known for his humorous dialogue with Larry the Lynx)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARRY THE LYNX<|>PERSON<|>Larry the Lynx is a character in Frontier Airlines commercials, known for his humorous dialogue with Jack the Rabbit)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSAN BOYLE<|>BRITAIN'S GOT TALENT<|>Susan Boyle's performance on Britain's Got Talent was a pivotal moment that showcased her unexpected talent<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUSAN BOYLE<|>SIMON COWELL<|>Simon Cowell's initial cynicism towards Susan Boyle's performance contributed to the dramatic narrative of her story<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JACK THE RABBIT<|>LARRY THE LYNX<|>Jack the Rabbit and Larry the Lynx engage in humorous dialogue in Frontier Airlines commercials<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRONTIER AIRLINES<|>JACK THE RABBIT<|>Jack the Rabbit is a character featured in Frontier Airlines commercials<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRONTIER AIRLINES<|>LARRY THE LYNX<|>Larry the Lynx is a character featured in Frontier Airlines commercials<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
