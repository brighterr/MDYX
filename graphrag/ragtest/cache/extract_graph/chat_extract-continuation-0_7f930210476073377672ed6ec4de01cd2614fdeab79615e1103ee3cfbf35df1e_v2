They some-\ntimes ask the same questions of competing brands.\nTracking studies show how a marketer’s brand is performing over time, especially after\nchanges are made in the marketing communication. Because several different measures are taken,\nfindings can indicate if there is an attention-getting problem, a recall problem (saw message but\ncan’t remember what it said), a trial problem (remembered the advertising but not moved to try\nthe brand), or a repeat problem (tried the brand but have not repurchased for some reason).\nBrand tracking is an approach that tracks the performance of the brand rather than or in ad-\ndition to the advertising. The assumption is that with fragmented media and an abundance of\nhigh-quality but similar products, it is more important to track the brand because it reflects the\nquality of the customer’s brand relationship. That’s at the heart of the Colorado Pass Club cam-\npaign. Instead of focusing on attributes and claims about a product, this research identifies how\ncustomers are involved with the brand and whether they are more favorably disposed toward it\nthan toward other brands. As Peppers and Rogers point out, you also need a centralized customer\ndatabase that allows you to track customer activity across channels.7\nThis analysis as depicted in Figure 19.3is also based on the factors identified in the Facets\nModel of Effects.\nAd/MC Response Brand Response FIGURE 19.3\nTracking Brand Response\nAwareness BrandSalience\nPerception Understand Brand Meaning Action\nMessage Behavioral\nRegisters Response\nBelieve Brand Preference\nConnect Identification with Brand\nBrand tracking studies generally use sets of brand-related questions, but Bain & Company,\na highly respected consulting firm, is promoting the use of a single-question test to track attitudes\nto a brand. Called net promoter, it tracks the response to a simple question: “How likely is it that\nyou would recommend us to a friend or colleague?”8Another single measure is brand penetra-\ntion,which is the number of customers who purchase the brand relative to the total population in\nthe market.9\nAlthoughthesesinglemeasuresareusefulasabroadindicationofbrandeffectiveness,the\nother questions found in brand tracking studies, such as those about awareness and credibility,\nforexample,areparticularlyimportantinanIMCprogrambecausetheyprovidediagnosticin-\nformationaboutareasofmarketingcommunicationthatmightneedtobechangedorrefined.\nBecausespendinginformationenterstheanalysis,muchofthefocusoftrackingstudiesis\nonthetargetmarket,theselectionofmediavehicles,theschedule,themarketingcommunica-\ntion mix, and the media mix.Account planners use several methods to collect tracking data,\nsuch as the attitude tests discussed earlier and wave analysis, consumer diaries, and pantry\nchecks:\n• WaveAnalysisWaveanalysislooksataseriesofinterviewsduringacampaign.Thetracking\nbeginswithasetofquestionsaskedofarandomsampleofconsumersonapredetermined\ndate.Afterthepersonisqualifiedashearingorseeingthead,theresearcherasksaseriesof\nfollow-upquestions.Theanswersserveasabenchmarkandallowadjustmentsinthemessage\ncontent,mediachoice,andtiming.Perhapstwomonthslater,theresearchermakesanotherse-\nriesofrandomcallsandasksthesamequestions.Thesecondwaveiscomparedwiththefirst\nuntilmanagementissatisfiedwiththead’smarketpenetrationandimpact.\n• Consumer DiariesSometimes advertisers ask a group of representative consumers to keep a\ndiary during a campaign. The consumers record activities such as brands purchased, brands\nused for various activities, brand switches, media usage, exposure to competitive promotions,\n588 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nand use of coupons. The advertiser can then review these consumer diariesand determine fac-\ntors such as whether the message is reaching the right target audience and whether the audience\nis responding to the message as intended. One common unfavorable finding from consumer\ndiaries is that no attitude or behavioral change occurred because of exposure to the campaign.\n• Pantry ChecksThepantry checkprovides much of the same information as the diary\nmethod but requires little from the consumer. Aresearcher goes to homes in the target mar-\nket and asks what brands or products they have purchased or used recently. In one variation\nof this procedure, the researcher counts the products or brands currently stocked by the con-\nsumer. The consumer may also be asked to keep empty packages, which the researcher then\ncollects and tallies.\nTest Markets Atest marketmight serve to evaluate product variations, as well as elements of\na campaign or a media mix. These are generally conducted in two or more markets with the same\nnumber of similar markets chosen to act as controls. In the control markets the researcher can ei-\nther (1) run no advertising or (2) continue to run the old ad. The new advertising (or product vari-\nation) is used in the test cities.
