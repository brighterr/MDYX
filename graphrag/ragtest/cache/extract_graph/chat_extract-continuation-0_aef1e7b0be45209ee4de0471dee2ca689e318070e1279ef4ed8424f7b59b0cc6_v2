Kuni “needed\nsomething that would stand out and give them instant name recognition with the people at smart.”\nThe idea was to send a set of kits before sending the official paperwork proposal. “They were all\nshrink wrapped. They came with scissors, glue, colors, points of interest for each city, smart cars,\ndealership buildings, and even customers ready to buy.” Kuni was successful in winning two\nsmart centers in Portland and Denver with this promotion.\nTypically companies spend more than half of their total promotion budget on promotions di-\nrected at the trade, which is to say that although consumer promotion is highly visible, trade pro-\nmotion is equally important as a marketing communication strategy. Let’s look at the types of\ntrade promotion.\nWhat Are the Types of Trade Promotion?\nTrade advertising directed at wholesalers and retailers provides trade members with information\naboutthenewproductanditssellingpoints.Inaddition,tradepromotiontechniques,especiallyprice\ndiscounts, point-of-purchase displays, and advertising allowances, motivate retailers to provide\nshelfspaceforproductsandconsumerpromotions.Resellers,theintermediariesinthedistribution\nchannel,employmillionsofpeople,includingsalespeopleinretailandthoseinwholesaling,who\nhelpdistributetheproductsmanufacturersmake.TheKingCornmanufacturerinourfictionalex-\namplewillbemoreencouragedthattheproductisacceptableifresellersarewillingtocarryandhelp\npromoteit.Manypromotionaldevicesdesignedtomotivateresellerstoengageincertainsalesac-\ntivitiesareavailabletothemanufacturer.Herearethemostcommontypesoftradepromotiontools:\n• Retailer(Dealer)KitsMaterialsthatsupportretailers’sellingeffortsorthathelprepresenta-\ntivesmakesalescallsonprospectiveretailingcustomersareoftendesignedassaleskits.\nCHAPTER 17 • PROMOTIONS 529\nTheKuniAutomotivekitsaregoodexam-\nplesofthistypeofpromotionalsalesmateri-\nals.Saleskitscontainsupporting\ninformation,suchasdetailedproductspeci-\nfications,how-todisplayinformation,and\nadslicks—printadsthatarereadytobesent\ntothelocalprintmediaassoonasthere-\ntailerordealeraddsidentification,location,\npromotionprice,orotherinformation.\n• Trade Incentives and DealsSimilar to con-\nsumer price deals, a manufacturer may re-\nward a reseller financially for purchase of a\ncertain level of a product or support of a\npromotion. These promotional efforts can\ntake the form of special displays, extra pur-\nchases, superior store locations, or greater\nlocal promotion. In return, retailers can re-\nceive special allowances, such as discounts, Nintendo launched its Wii game with demonstrations at entertainment\nfree goods, gifts, or cash from the manufac- and video game trade shows.\nturer. The most common types of trade\ndealsare buying allowances for increasing\npurchases and advertising allowances, which include deals on cooperative advertising and\ndisplay allowances, or deals for agreeing to use promotional displays.\n• ContestsAs in the case of consumer sales promotion, advertisers can develop contests and\nsweepstakes to motivate resellers. Contests are far more common than sweepstakes, mainly\nbecause resellers find it easy to tie contest prizes to the sale of the sponsor’s product. Asales\nquota is set, for example, and the retailer or person who exceeds the quota by the largest per-\ncentage wins the contest.\n• Point-of-PurchasePromotionsAccordingtothePoint-of-PurchaseAdvertisingInterna-\ntional(POPAI)association,themarketing-at-retailindustryincludesthreeforms:manufac-\nturer-designeddisplaysdistributedtoretailerswhotheirproductsandcreateapersonality\nfortheirstores,andsignsanddisplaysusedbyretailerstocuetheirbrandimagesanddif-\nferentiatetheirstoresfromthoseofcompetitors.13Thesearereferredtoaspoint-of-pur-\nchase(PoP)materials.AlthoughPoPformsvarybyindustry,theycanincludespecial\nracks,displaycartons,banners,signs,pricecards,andmechanicalproductdispensers,\namongothertools.\n• Trade Shows and ExhibitsThetrade showis a place where companies within the same in-\ndustries gather to present and sell their merchandise and to demonstrate their products. Ex-\nhibits are the spaces that are designed to showcase the product.\nHow Is Trade Promotion Used?\nThe ultimate gauge of a successful trade promotion is whether sales increase. Trade promotions\nare primarily designed to get the cooperation of people in the distribution channel and to encour-\nage their promotion of the product to consumers. Sales promotion brings resellers to that point of\nconviction. There are two primary roles for a trade promotion:\n1. Trade SupportTo stimulate in-store merchandising or other trade support (for example,\nfeature pricing, superior store location, or shelf space)\n2. ExcitementTo create a high level of excitement about the product among those responsi-\nble for its sale.\nIn addition, trade promotion is also used to accomplish other marketing objectives, such as mani-\npulating levels of inventory held by wholesalers and retailers and expanding product distribution\nto new areas of the country or new classes of trade.\nDemand: Push-and-Pull Strategies As explained in Chapter 3, manufacturers hope to see their\ntrade partners push a product. To understand the role of trade promotion, consider how sales pro-\nmotion is used in push-and-pull strategies.
