And they did so by creating the beloved bovines that could do\nthe selling for them.\nThe company couldn’t outspend the competition. It couldn’t even afford a na-\ntional campaign on television, which is where most of its competitors were adver-\ntising. So it decided to advertise where its competitors weren’t—on billboards.\nCopywriters kept the idea simple and fun (after all, they are selling chicken sand-\nwiches) and the copy to a minimum.\nFor Chick-fil-A and its agency, overcoming the challenge turned out to be eas-\nier than expected. Chick-fil-A’s “Eat Mor Chikin” three-dimensional billboard cam-\npaign helped break the fast-food hamburger pattern. The witty use of Holstein\ncows encouraging the target audience to “Eat Mor Chikin” instead of beef pro-\nvided a bold brand personality that broke through industry clutter. Why? The mes-\nsage and execution were simple, the cows were funny, the creative idea was\nunexpected, and the call to action was powerful.\nIn this chapter you will learn what it takes to write effective copy. You will read\nabout different techniques for a variety of media. You will also learn what it takes\nfor companies such as Chick-fil-A to create memorable advertising that works.\nDid the charming cows successfully moo-ve consumers to eat more Chick-fil-A?\nHoof it to the end of the chapter to see the results.\nSources:www.chick-fil-a.com; information courtesy of Mike Buerno, The Richards Group, “Winners Showcase,” www.effie.org;\nwww.lamaroutdoor.com/outdoorfiles.\nWords and pictures work together to produce a creative concept. However, the idea behind a cre-\native concept in advertising is usually expressed in some attention-getting and memorable phrase,\nsuch as “Curiously Strong Mints” for Altoids or “Eat Mor Chikin.” Finding these “magic words”\nis the responsibility of copywriters who search for the right way to warm up a mood or soften con-\nsumer resistance. They begin with the strategy outlined in the previous chapter, which is usually\nsummarized in a creative brief. Then, working with an art director, and perhaps a creative direc-\ntor, the creative team searches for Big Ideas, in the form of magic words and powerful visuals that\ntranslate the strategy into a message that is attention getting and memorable. This chapter de-\nscribes the role of the copywriter as part of this team and explains the practice of copywriting in\nprint, broadcast, and Internet advertising.\nWHAT IS THE LANGUAGE OF COPYWRITING?\nSome creative concepts are primarily visual, but intriguing ideas can also be expressed through\nlanguage; and a truly great Big Idea will come to life in the interaction between the words and\npictures. For example, a long-running campaign for the NYNEX Yellow Pages illustrates how\nwords and pictures work together to create a concept with a twist. The campaign used visual\nplays on words to illustrate some of the headings in its directory. Each pun makes sense when\nthe visual is married with the heading from the directory but neither the words or the pictures\nwould work on their own. One commercial in the series included three train engineers with over-\nalls, caps, and bandannas sitting in rocking chairs in a parlor and having tea to illustrate the\n“Civil Engineering” category; a picture of a bull sleeping on its back illustrates the category\n“Bulldozing.”\nCHAPTER 9 • COPYWRITING 261\nAlthough advertising is highly visual, words are crucial\nin four types of advertisements:\n1. ComplexIf the message is complicated, particularly if\nit is making an argument, words can be more specific\nthan visuals and can be read over and over until the\nmeaning is clear.\n2. HighInvolvementIftheadisforahigh-involvement\nproduct,meaningtheconsumerspendsalotoftime\nconsideringit,thenthemoreinformationthebetter.\nThatmeansusingwords.\n3. ExplanationInformation that needs definition and ex-\nplanation, like how a new wireless phone works, is\nbest delivered through words.\n4. AbstractIf a message tries to convey abstract qualities,\nsuch as justice and quality, words tend to communicate\nCLASSIC\nthese concepts more easily than pictures.\nThe NYNEX ads feature puns based on Yellow Pages\ncategory headings. This ad, which is directed to media\nThe Copywriter buyers, uses that same creative Big Idea with a visual\npun on the heading “Amusement Devices” in the\nThe person who shapes and sculpts the words in marketing\ndirectory.\ncommunication is called a copywriter. Copy is the text of\nan ad or the words people say in a commercial. Asuccess-\nful advertising copywriter is a savvy marketer and a literary master, sometimes described as a\n“killer poet.” Many copywriters have a background in English or literature. They love words\nand search for the clever twist, the pun, the powerful description, the punch, the nuance, as well\nas the rhyme and rhythm of speech. They use words that whip and batter, plead, sob, cajole,\nand impress. They know the meanings, derivations, moods, and feelings of words and the re-\nverberations and vibrations they create in a reader’s mind. Aclassic ad, titled “The Wonderful\nWorld of Words,” expresses this fascination.
