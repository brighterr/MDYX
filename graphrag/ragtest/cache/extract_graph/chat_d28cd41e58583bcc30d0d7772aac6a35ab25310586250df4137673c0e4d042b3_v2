Consider a watch that costs $500—what does that price say? On one hand, it may say\nthat it’s a prestige or quality product; on the other hand, it might suggest that the watch is expen-\nsive, maybe too expensive. In fact, the meaning of the price is dependent on the context provided\nby the marketing communication, which puts the price in perspective.\nPlace (Distribution) It does little good to offer a good or service that will meet customers’needs\nunless you have a mechanism for making the product available and handling the exchange of pay-\nment for the product. What marketers call distributionincludes the channels used to make the\nproduct easily accessible to customers.\nPuma, for example, is growing the market for its shoes and athletic apparel because of its\nunusual approach to distribution. Its channel marketing strategy delivers Puma products to ex-\nclusive and mass-market audiences, selling its edgy designs to trendy retailers and then placing\nits more mainstream products in mall stores. Foot Locker might sell the GVspecial, a style based\non a retro Puma tennis shoe from its glory days 30 years ago; at the same time an independent\nfashion store might carry a basketball shoe in fabrics like snakeskin or lizard. In recent years,\nPuma has expanded its distribution program to include its own stores, which greet customers with\na unique shopping environment reflecting the personality of the Puma brand.\nThe choice of a distribution channel also sends messages. The image of an athletic shoe, like\nPuma, can be quite different if it’s sold in Kmart, as opposed to Nordstrom. Marketing managers\nconsider a variety of channels when choosing distribution strategies.\nThe Internet has brought another distribution question. “Clicks or bricks” is a phrase used to\ndescribe whether a product is sold online (clicks) or in a traditional store (bricks). Another distri-\nbution strategy involves the use of intermediaries, such as retailers. Direct marketing compa-\nnies, such as Lands’End and Dell, distribute their products directly without the use of a reseller.\nCHAPTER 2 • INTEGRATED BRAND COMMUNICATION 43\nThe sale is totally dependent on the effectiveness of the direct-response advertising. The more fa-\nmiliar strategy of distributing the product through one or more distributors and retailers is what\nwe described earlier as channel marketing.\nAnother distribution-related strategy involves the distinction between push and pull strategies.\nApush strategydirects marketing efforts at resellers, and success depends on the ability of these in-\ntermediaries to market the product, which they often do with their own advertising. In contrast, a pull\nstrategydirects marketing efforts at the consumer and attempts to pull the product through the chan-\nnel by intensifying consumer demand. The decision to use a push or pull strategy determines, to some\nextent, the audience to be targeted and the nature of the demand to be addressed by the message.\nMarketing Communication The last of the Four Ps is promotion,or what we call marketing com-\nmunication(marcom, for short), which includes such tools as advertising, public relations, sales pro-\nmotion, direct response, events and sponsorships, point of sale, digital media, and the communication\naspects of packaging, as well as personal sales, and a number of new forms of online and place-based\ncommunication that have emerged recently. The rest of the book is focused on this element—our goal\nis to help you understand how marketing communication works to support a marketing plan.\nIn Figure 2.2, note how we positioned marketing communication in the center of the Four Ps.\nThe point is, as you may remember from our First Principle of IMCin Chapter 1that everything\ncommunicates.In practice, we can rephrase that to say everything in the marketing mix can send a\nmessage.How the product is designed and how it performs, where the brand is sold, and at what\nprice—all of these marketing decisions send messages about the brand’s position, quality, and image.\nIn fact, we can rephrase that first principle again as “Everything a brand does,and some-\nPrinciple\ntimes what it doesn’t do,can send a message.”Unintentional messages come from brand experi-\nEvery part of the\nences; for example, a long wait on a customer service help line or the inability of a company marketing mix, not\nrepresentative to answer a product safety question sends the message that the company doesn’t just marketing\nvalue a customer’s time or safety. Those messages can be more powerful—in a negative way— communication—\nthan anything said in the advertising. That’s why it’s necessary to monitor all marketing elements sends a message.\nfrom a communication perspective.\nThe same creative spirit that drives Puma’s product design also drives its marketing com-\nmunication,whichtypicallyusesnontraditionalwaystoconnectwithcustomers,suchaswordof\nmouthandothermarcomprogramsthatpromotethebrandonthestreetandonthefeetofitsdevo-\ntees,aswellasontheInternet.RetailerspraisePumaforitseye-catching,in-storemerchandising\ndisplays.OthercleverideasincludepromotionsatsushirestaurantsduringtheWorldCupheldin\nJapanandSouthKorea.Pumagotawell-knownsushicheftocreateaspecialPumasushirollthat\nwasservedinselectJapaneser\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
