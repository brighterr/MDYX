Following complex sampling strategies, they made their way through everything from\napartment buildings to rural farm areas, with their sampling road map designed to maximize\nthe randomness and representativeness of the population they studied. It wasn’t surprising to\nsee this laborious and oftentimes even dangerous approach to collecting survey data re-\nplaced by telephone interviewing by the 1970s.\n• Phone InterviewsAs access to telephones increased after World War II, calling soon became\nthe survey mode of choice, as it was much less expensive and far less invasive than sending\ninterviewers out to people’s homes. The listing of phone numbers in phone directories gave\nresearchers the perfect source from which they could draw a random sample,which means\neach person in the population has an equal chance of being selected to be in the sample. Al-\nthough telephone interviewing was more practical than going from door to door, researchers\nlost the ability to interact directly with their participants when communicating just by tele-\nphone, especially when there was a need to show pictures or samples of what they were\nevaluating. However, telephone surveys were not only more cost effective but necessary as\npeople stopped answering their doors due to solicitation efforts (door-to-door sales were\nvery common at that time) and concerns over personal safety.\nBut over time, telephone interviewing too faced its challenges. In the late 1980s and\nearly 1990s, telemarketing efforts became so pervasive that consumers sought ways to make\nit stop, from the use of call-screening devices such as answering machines and Caller ID to\nsigning up on the National Do Not Call Registry, which put legal ramifications behind unso-\nlicited phone calls. Although marketing research calls were exempt from this legislation, be-\ncause nothing is being sold, research calls were screened out with the rest as consumers\nfortified their privacy efforts. Today it is not uncommon for up to 60 percent of households\n176 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nto not answer their phones when called for a survey. Just as door-to-door surveying met its\nend as more cost-effective and acceptable alternatives became available, researchers once\nagain need to look for new alternatives for gathering survey data.\n• Mail SurveysAs household addresses became readily available after the Second World War,\nmail surveys increased in use because researchers could pull addresses from city directories.\nSpecialized research companies sold lists of addresses to direct marketers and these lists also\nwere used by researchers. Mail surveys were popular because they didn’t use live interview-\ners and thus were even less expensive than telephone surveys. In terms of survey design, the\nmail surveys have to be extremely easy to understand and all of the questions need to be\ncarefully tested because an interviewer won’t be present to clarify respondents’questions.\nMany variables determine the response rate, such as the interest level of the topic to the re-\nspondent, personalization of the message, the quality of the paper, the design of the enve-\nlope, and the inclusion of a prepaid return envelope. In spite of all the testing that has been\ndone on mail survey design, the problem continues to be a low return rate, in addition to the\nloss of direct contact with the respondent.\n• Internet SurveysToday, the world of data collection is changing again. Landline telephones\nare on the decline as cell phones become more popular and are beginning to be used for re-\nsearch. Unlisted phone numbers are becoming more common. Mail surveys have become\nlargely ineffective, with response rates sometimes as low as the 1 to 3 percent range, which\ncan fail to meet the statistical criteria necessary for valid random sampling. Researchers\nhave been forced by these changes to find new ways to collect data from respondents. Tele-\nphone and mail surveys are gradually being replaced by\nonline survey methods.\nThe Internet has opened up new opportunities for\ncollecting data (see the A Matter of Practice:Part 1fea-\nture). In Chapter 7you’ll read about the Billings, Mon-\ntana, rebranding campaign in which the campaign was\nlaunched with an online survey of more than 1,000 peo-\nple.We have printed here the screen download, “Take the\nSurvey,” from this effort.\nIn addition to survey research, the Internet can also be a\nuseful tool for monitoring online behavior. Jason Cormier, co-\nfounder of social-media agency Room 214, explains that mar-\nketing communication research can be based on the data\nprovided by members of social networks such as Facebook.\nThe rebranding campaign for Billings began with a broad\nOne example of this type of research is pay per click.
