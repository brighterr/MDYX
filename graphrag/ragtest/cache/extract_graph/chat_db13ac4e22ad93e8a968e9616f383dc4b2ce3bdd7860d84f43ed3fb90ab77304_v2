Reach category thought leaders and influencers in a way that will motivate them to initiate\nmeasurable word of mouth (WOM) and other positive brand messages.\n430 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nThe first of these objectives is the most common. It recognizes that you can seldom ever\nreach 100 percent of your target audience. It also acknowledges that a certain level of frequency\nwill be necessary for the brand messages to been seen/heard/read. The second objective would be\nfor a product where the message is more complex; through research (and judgment) it has been\ndecided that prospects need to be exposed to the message at least five times to be effective. In this\ncase frequency is more important than reach. Put another way, it is more important to reach a\nsmall portion of the audience five or more times and have them respond than it is to reach a ma-\njor portion fewer than five times and have little or no response.\nObjectives 3 and 4 deal directly with impact. To achieve these objectives, media buyers will\nhave to find media vehicles and contact points, such as events and sponsorships, where interaction\nwith the brand and its users is possible as opposed to using more passive media such as traditional\nmass media. Note that objective 4 is not measurable as stated.\nStep 3: Media Strategies\nStrategic thinking in media involves a set of decision factors and tools that help identify the best\nway to deliver the brand message. Regardless of whether a company spends a few hundred dollars\non one medium or millions of dollars on a variety of media, the goal is still the same: to reach the\nright people at the right time with the right message.\nMedia strategyis the way media planners determine the most cost-effective way to reach\nthe target audience and satisfy the media objectives. Specific media strategies are based on ana-\nlyzing and comparing various ways to accomplish the media objectives, and then selecting the\napproach that is estimated to be the most effective alternative. The idea is that there are always\nmultiple ways to reach an objective, but which way is the best?\nStrategies That Deliver Reach and Frequency In certain situations, for example, when the ob-\njectives call for high reach, the strategies used would involve creating broad exposure using many\nmedia vehicles. For example, high-reach strategies might be used in order to provide reminders\nfor a well-known brand or to introduce a new product that has a broadly defined target market.\nIf the objectives specify high frequency, then the media strategies will probably be narrower\nin focus with a more limited list of media vehicles. That would be the case for niche products with\ntightly defined target markets (low reach) or for products that need a high level of information and\nexplanation. High-frequency strategies are also used to counter competitive offers and to build the\nbrand’s share of voice in a highly cluttered category. Sometimes a low-frequency objective is spec-\nified when there is less need for repetition. If you are advertising a two-liter Coke for 89 cents, you\ndon’t need to repeat the message a lot, but if you are trying to explain how DVR systems work,\nthen you may need more frequency.\nMedia Mix Selection The reach and frequency objectives also lead to decisions about the me-\ndia mix. We mentioned earlier that you can rarely generate an acceptable reach level with just one\nmedia vehicle. Most brands use a variety of targeted media vehicles, called a media mix,to reach\ncurrent and potential customers. ESPN, for example, uses TV, magazines, radio, and the Internet,\nas well as original programming on its own ESPN channel, to promote its programs.\nMedia mixes are used for a number of reasons. The first is to reach people not reached by\nthe first or most important medium. Using a variety of media vehicles distributes the message\nmore widely because different media tend to have different audience profiles. Of course, these\ndifferent audience groups should generally fit within the brand’s target market.\nSome people even reject certain media: television advertising, for example, is considered in-\ntrusive and Internet advertising is irritating to some people. Other reasons for spreading the plan\nacross different media include adding exposure in less expensive media and using media that have\nsome attractive characteristics that enhance the creative message. On the other hand, an Ad Age\ncolumnist believes media planners shouldn’t give up traditional media just because digital media\nhave become “sexy” and are seen as having lower costs.4\nStill, the reason for choosing a particular medium or a set of media vehicles depends on the\nmedia objectives. What media will best deliver what effects—and can you reinforce and extend\nthose effects with a mix of media? If audience reach is an objective, then television still reaches the\nlargest audience; if frequency is important, then radio may be the best media vehicle to use. Print\nand television are considered more trustworthy, so they might be used by a media planner for a cam-\nCHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 431\npaign that seeks to establish credibil-\nity for a brand or believability for a\nproduct claim. The Practical Tips\nbox summarizes the reasons media\nplanners choose various media.\nAn analysis of one industry’s\nmedia mix choices presents an inter-\nesting argument about the logic of\nthe media mix.
