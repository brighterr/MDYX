In the United States, advertising is a $30 bil-\nlion industry.2Advertising often is seen as the driving force in marketing communication because\nit commands the largest budget, as well as the largest number of agencies and professionals.\nTogetanideaofthescopeoftheadvertisingindustry,considerTables1.1and1.2,which\ngivesomeindicationofthesizeoftheadvertisingindustrybybreakingoutthetop10advertising\ncategoriesandadvertisers.InTable1.1lookathowspendingchangedinthecourseofayearfrom\n2008to2009basedonThirdQuarter(JanuarytoSeptember)figures.Whichcategoriesandad-\nvertisers were on the increase and which decreased and what do you think accounts for those\nchanges?\nAs we said, advertising’s original purpose was to sell something, but over the years, other\npromotional tools, with different sets of strengths, have developed to help meet that objective.\nFor example, providing information, particularly about some new feature or a new product, is\nsometimes better handled through publicity or public relations. Direct-response advertising,\nsuch as catalogs and flyers sent to the home or office, can also provide more information in\nmore depth than traditional ads that are limited in space and time. Specialtiesthat carry brand\nlogos as reminders or incentives to buy are handled by sales promotioncompanies. Communi-\ncation with employees and shareholders about brands and campaigns is usually handled by\npublic relations.\nInotherwords,avarietyofpromotionaltoolscanbeusedtoidentify,inform,andpersuade.\nProfessionals see differences in all of these areas, but many people just see them all as\nTable 1.1 Top Ten Advertising Categories by Ad Expenditure\n2009 Advertising\nCategory Spending ($m) % Change Since 2008\n1.
