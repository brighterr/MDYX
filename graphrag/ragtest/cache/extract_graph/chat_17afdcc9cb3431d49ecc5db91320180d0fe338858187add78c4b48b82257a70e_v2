Both words and pictures are\ndesigned to create exactly the right impact. Because of the number of visual and audio elements,\nas well as the many ways they can be combined, a television commercial is one of the most com-\nplex of all advertising forms. It is also an ideal form for storytelling. Copywriters who write\nscripts for television commercials are masters of the emotional moment as researcher Charles\nYoung explains in the A Matter of Practicefeature.\nVideo and Motion When we watch a commercial, we are more aware of what we’re seeing than\nanything else. Copywriters keep in mind that visuals and motion, the silent speech of film, should\nconvey as much of the message—the Big Idea—as possible. Likewise, emotion, which is the ef-\nfect created by storytelling, is expressed convincingly in facial expressions, gestures, and other\nbody language. Because television is theatrical, many of the copywriter’s tools, such as charac-\nters, costumes, sets and locations, props, lighting, optical and computerized special effects, and\non-screen graphics, are similar to those you would use in a play, television show, or movie.\nAudio As in radio, the three audio elements are music, voices, and sound effects, but they are\nused differently in television commercials because they are connected to a visual image. The copy-\nwriter may have an announcer speak directly to the viewer or engage in a dialogue with another\nperson, who may or may not be on camera. The copywriter writes the words they will say and\nblocks out on paper how this “talk” happens. Acommon manipulation of the camera–announcer\nrelationship is the voice-over,in which an announcer who is not visible describes some kind of\naction on the screen. Sometimes a voice is heard off camera, which means you can’t see the\nspeaker and the voice is coming from the side, behind, or above.\nCHAPTER 9 • COPYWRITING 279\nA MATTER OF PRACTICE\nHow the Emotional Pivot Works in a Story\nCharles Young, Founder and CEO, Ameritest\nTo investigate the power of emo- see strong negative emotions at the beginning of the\ntional engagement in a video, video shown with strong spikes in the red line.
