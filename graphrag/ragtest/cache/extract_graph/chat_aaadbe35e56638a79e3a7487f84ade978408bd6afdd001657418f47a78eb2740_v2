During the 1930s and 1940s, Daniel Starch, A. C. Nielsen, and\nGeorge Gallup founded research organizations that are still part of today’s advertising industry.\nDuring and after the Great Depression, Raymond Rubicam emerged as an advertising power\nand launched his own agency with John Orr Young, a Lord & Thomas copywriter under the name\nof Young and Rubicam. Their work was known for intriguing headlines and fresh, original ap-\nproaches to advertising ideas.\nTargeting,the idea that messages should be directed at particular groups of prospective buy-\ners, evolved as media became more complex. Advertisers realized that they could spend their\nbudgets more efficiently by identifying those most likely to purchase a product, as well as the best\nways to reach them. The scientific era helped media better identify their audiences. In 1914 the\nAudit Bureau of Circulation (ABC) was formed to standardize the definition of paid circulation\nfor magazines and newspapers. Media changes saw print being challenged by radio advertising\nin 1922. Radio surpassed print in ad revenue in 1938.\nThe world of advertising agencies and management of advertising developed rapidly in the\nyearsafterWorldWarII.TheJ.WalterThompson(JWT)agency,whichstillexiststoday,ledthe\nboominadvertisingduringthisperiod.Theagency’ssuccesswasduelargelytoitscreativecopyand\nthemanagementstyleofthehusband-and-wifeteamofStanleyandHelenResor.Stanleydeveloped\ntheconceptofaccountservicesandexpandedtheaccountexecutiveroleintostrategydevelopment;\nHelendevelopedinnovativecopywritingtechniques.TheResorsalsocoinedthebrand namecon-\nceptasastrategytoassociateauniqueidentitywithaparticularproductaswellastheconceptof\nstatusappealtopersuadenonwealthypeopletoimitatethehabitsofrichpeople(www.jwt.com).\nTelevision commercials came on the scene in the early 1950s and brought a huge new rev-\nenue stream to the advertising industry. In 1952 the Nielsen rating system for TVadvertising be-\ncame the primary way to measure the reach of TV commercials.\nThis period also saw marketing practices, such as product differentiation and market seg-\nmentation incorporated into advertising strategy. The idea of positioning, carving out a unique\nspot in people’s minds for the brand, was developed by Al Ries and Jack Trout in 1969.\nThe Creative Revolution The creative power of agencies exploded in the 1960s and 1970s,\na period marked by the resurgence of art, inspiration, and intuition.
