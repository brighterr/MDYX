Public relations objectives are designed by PR planners to make changes in the pub-\nlic’s knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to a company, brand, or organization. Usually,\nthese objectives focus on creating credibility, delivering information, and building positive im-\nages, trust, and corporate goodwill.\nAcompany may also seek to change behavior, but that is a difficult task. Before changing\nbehavior, a communication effort may need to change people’s beliefs, attitudes, and feelings. In\nmany PR efforts, these communication effects are easier to accomplish and measure than behav-\nior change. Typical public relations objectives include:\n• Creating a corporate or organization brand\n• Shaping or redefining a corporate reputation\n• Positioning or repositioning a company or brand\n• Moving a brand to a new market or a global market\n• Launching a new product or brand\n• Disseminating news about a brand, company, or organization\n• Providing product or brand information\n• Changing stakeholder attitudes, opinions, or behaviors about a brand or company\n• Creating stronger brand relationships with key stakeholders, such as employees, sharehold-\ners and the financial community, government, members (for associations), and the media\n• Creating high levels of customer (member) satisfaction\n• Creating excitement in the marketplace\n• Creating buzz (word of mouth)\n• Involving people with the brand, company, or organization through events and other partici-\npatory activities Principle\n• Associating brands and companies with good causes. Before changing behavior,\na communication program\nChange Agent Strategies Changing the attitudes that drive behavior is central to public rela-\nmay need to change\ntions programs. Change agentprograms can be internal strategies focused on employees (some- beliefs, attitudes, and\ntimes called internal marketing) or external and focused on other publics, such as customers and feelings.\nother stakeholders. Regardless of the reason for change,\n“communication with principal stakeholders ranks high in\nthe hierarchy of factors that predict success. Communication\nis second only to the main stakeholders’participation in the\nprocess.”18\nInvolvement Strategies Public relations uses participation\nto intensify stakeholder involvement with a company or\nbrand. Involvement can create interest and a feeling of ex-\ncitement, but more importantly it can drive loyalty. Getting\npeople to participate in an action plan is one way to drive be-\nhavior change. For example, Pizza Hut’s “Book It” effort is\nan incentive program used by schools to offer free pizzas to\nreward students for reading.\nThe Big Idea\nCreative ideas are just as important in public relations as in\nadvertising—and for the same reason: to get attention. The\nClark County Desert Conservation Program in Nevada wanted\nto promote desert environments and threats to their ecology.\nMojave Max, a desert tortoise that is at least 50 years old, be-\ncame the group’s mascot and announces the arrival of spring,\njust like Punxsutawney Phil does in the East.

Critics say the over-\nexposure was in poor taste, but other PR experts\nsay it was an example of a stunt that will be\ntalked about for years.
