In accordance with\n*This chapter opening story was contributed by Jennifer Wolfe-Kimbell, Senior Marketing Manager at Vail Resorts,\nBroomfield, Colorado. 577\n578 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nthe “canned spam” laws, everyone on the list has opted in and asked for e-mail\npromotions and information. This is a perfectly qualified database of customers—\nthey own our product and raised their hands for more information.\nAs we headed into the selling season for 2009–2010 season passes, the mar-\nketing department was charged with ensuring that (1) our loyal pass holders stayed\nloyal and renewed—locking them in for the season, (2) previous pass holders re-\nturned, and (3) individuals with competitor passes converted to the Colorado Pass.\nOnce we had secured a healthy base of season-pass holders we had to focus\non generating revenue for the various lines of business within the company (lodg-\ning, ski school, rentals, dining). The challenge for us was that it had been a partic-\nularly difficult landscape. The recession was in full swing and we had to contend\nwith cautious consumers, elevated gas prices (something the drive market was sen-\nsitive to), and a relatively low snow season (this group lives for snow days).\nBeyond encouraging our pass holders to renew their passes, what could we do\nto take advantage of that pass holder database?\nThe concept of the Colorado Pass Club (CPC) was introduced as the\n2006–2007 ski season wound down. The objectives for the CPC were to distance\nthe Colorado Pass from competitive passes by offering elevated benefits. In par-\nticular, we wanted to create a sense of community among Colorado Pass holders.\nMoving forward, we wanted to continue to drive awareness of the inclusive and ex-\nclusive aspects of the pass program.\nTo further the sense of community and ownership within our pass holder group\nwe developed the tagline “It’s Why I Live Here.” This tagline strategically positions\nour resorts and having a pass with other iconic Colorado experiences. Skiing, and\nbeing outdoors, is an integral part of living in Colorado. We felt that this statement\nspoke to a broad market, tapped into sense of pride and exclusivity about living in\nColorado, and complemented the CPC efforts well.\nOur CPC program included biweekly e-mails full of promotions, offers, and dis-\ncounts exclusively for pass holders. Promotions ranged from dining and event tick-\nets to deeply discounted lodging, ski tune-ups, and discounts on gear. We also\ngave away tickets to sporting events, free mountain lunches, gas cards, and tickets\nto music events. Called “Random Acts of Pass Holder Kindness,” these offers were\ndiverse enough to create a strong response and a lot of interest and to elevate the\nperceived value of the season pass.\nMany of our efforts were also supported by radio spots and a special CPC web-\nsite that recapped the contents of our biweekly e-mails. Slowly these e-mails\nstarted creating buzz in the pass holder community, and soon they were being for-\nwarded to friends and family.\nNot only did the CPC e-mails generate interest and excitement with Colorado\nPass holders, they generated trackable revenue—everything from lodging pur-\nchases to ski school lessons, to equipment rentals and, of course, season pass re-\nnewals. In fact, our e-mail programs were one of the strongest performing channels\nfor our promotions!\nWe decided to leverage the passion around our season passes and launched a\nreferral program, rewarding skiers for referring their friends to buy a pass—furthering\nour intent of building a community. We were able to test various versions of e-mails—\nwe learned that simpler was better and started to reframe offers by coming up with\na few high-impact offers rather than several small gestures.\nAs the program continues to evolve, we have learned quite a bit about our\npass holders and have begun to not only offer them great benefits and expressions\nCHAPTER 19 • EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS 579\nof appreciation, we engage them in a dialogue and use this group for surveys\nabout product attributes and program improvements.\nWe also designed unique ways to engage them with content by running con-\ntests asking why they haven’t skied more. When our pass holders responded with\nstories about job loss, bad equipment, the need for improved ski technique, we re-\nsponded by finding one pass holder a job, giving gift certificates to replace equip-\nment, and signing them up for free ski school! The pass holder community loved it.\nThe result cemented the Colorado Pass Club as the most important club for\nColorado skiers. You can find out more about what we achieved by turning to the\nend of the chapter and reading It’s a Wrap.\nThroughout this book you’ve read about the effectiveness of\nadvertising. We’ve emphasized that effective campaigns do\nmore than win awards for creativity.
