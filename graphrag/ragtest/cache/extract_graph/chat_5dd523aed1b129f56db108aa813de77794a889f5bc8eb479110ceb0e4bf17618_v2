What are their emotional links to the brand?\nQualitative methods often are used early in the process of developing a brand communica-\ntion plan or message strategy for generating insights, as well as questions and hypotheses for ad-\nditional research. They are also good at confirming hunches, ruling out bad approaches and\nquestionable or confusing ideas, and giving direction to the message strategy. However, because\nqualitative research is typically done with small groups, researchers cannot project their findings\nto the larger population.\nRather than drawing conclusions, qualitative research is used to answer the question why, as\nwell as generate hypotheses that can be tested with quantitative methods.3As Sally Reinman,\nworldwide market planner at Saatchi & Saatchi, wrote for this book, research is more than num-\nbers. She explains:\nResearch processes are more varied and exciting than ever before.
