The Virtual Army Experience is a great example\nof how the new media can be used to engage prospects and persuade them to commit. In this chap-\nter we will discuss a number of interactive media, including the Internet, e-mail, and social me-\ndia, that connect people in a network of word-of-mouth communication.

New operating systems, called platforms, include not only the\niPhone, which has been the innovative leader, but also Research in Motion’s (RIM) Blackberry\nand Google’s Android. MySpace, Facebook, Wikipedia, Craigslist, YouTube, Flickr, and Google\nare just a few of the sites that provide new tools that permit users to customize messages and in-\nteract, which creates new ways of looking at media use by consumers.
