Most recently, Save-A-Landmark\nrefurbished the National Civil Rights Museum (seen in opening photo), originally\nthe Lorraine Motel and site of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Hampton\nhas donated more than $2.5 million and hundreds of thousands of volunteer hours\ntoward the project.\nFor more information about how these efforts have affected Hampton’s repu-\ntation as a company that cares, turn to the end of the chapter and read the It’s a\nWrapfeature.\nSources:Eric Litchfield, Cohn & Wolfe; www.hamptonlandmarks.com.\nWhen you hear about Hampton taking responsibility to improve the communities where its ho-\ntels are located, doesn’t that make you feel good about deciding to sleep there? You don’t have\nto think hard to discover lots of other corporations and organizations trying to make their audi-\nences feel good about their brand and gain the goodwill of the public, which is one objective of\npublic relations. We focus our discussion in this chapter on the role of public relations in an or-\nganization, exploring how goodwill can be used effectively in a marketing communication pro-\ngram. You’ll read about the types of PR programs, planning, and tools, and also about gauging\ntheir effectiveness.\nWHAT IS PUBLIC RELATIONS?\nPublic relations is a fundamental communication discipline covering a wide range of functions\nthat help an organization connect with the people it touches. Those functions include internal re-\nlations, publicity, advertising, press agentry, public affairs, lobbying, issues management, in-\nvestor relations, and development.\nPublic relations is used to generate goodwill for an organization. That mission is as broad in\nscope as the definition suggests: “Public relationsis the management function that establishes\nand maintains mutually beneficial relationships between an organization and the publics on\nwhom its success or failure depends.”1Afield that is rapidly changing and growing, public rela-\ntions is increasingly used to build and maintain reciprocal relationships through dialogue and\ntwo-way communication in our networked society.\nPublic relations focuses on all the relationships an organization has with its various publics.\nBypublics,we mean all the groups of people with which a company or organization interacts:\nemployees, members, customers, local communities, shareholders, other institutions, and society\nat large. Another term for this is stakeholders,which refers more specifically to people who have\na stake, financial or otherwise, in a company or organization. In the Hampton case, the “Save-A-\nLandmark” campaign reaches multiple publics, including the residents of the areas where the ho-\ntels are located, travelers, and its employees.\nPublic relations is practiced by a wide range of organizations—companies, governments,\ntrade and professional associations, nonprofit organizations, the travel and tourism industry, ed-\nucational systems, labor unions, politicians, organized sports, and the media. Most organizations\nhave in-house public relations departments that handle the organizations’public relations work,\nalthough many also hire outside public relations agencies. Public relations is a dynamic, global\nCHAPTER 15 • PUBLIC RELATIONS 461\nprofession. One organization, The Global Alliance for Public Relations and Communications\nManagement, represents 160,000 pros in about 70 countries. Find out more about this group at\nwww.globalalliancepr.org.\nOn one level, public relations is a tactical function in that PR staff produce a variety of com-\nmunication tools to achieve corporate image objectives. On a higher level, it is a management\nfunction that monitors public opinion and advises senior corporate managers on how to achieve\npositive relationships with various audiences (publics) to effectively manage the organization’s\nimage and reputation. Its publics may be external (customers, the news media, the investment\ncommunity, the general public, government bodies) and internal (shareholders, employees).\nSir Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPPGroup, one of the largest advertising and marketing services\ngroups in the world, believes that “public relations and public affairs are probably higher up on\nthe CEO’s agenda than advertising, market research, or other forms of specialist communication.”\nAs Sorrell notes, public relations practitioners have “access to the CEO’s office,” which can give\nthem more influence on corporate policies.2\nPublic Opinion\nPublic relations programs are built on an understanding of public opinion on issues critical to the\norganization, such as the company’s impact on the environment and its local community or work-\ners’rights and how a company deals with its employees. Public opinion,the term describing what\na group of people thinks, expresses beliefs based on their experiences with people, events, insti-\ntutions, or products.\nThe public relations strategist researches the answers to two primary questions about public\nopinion to design effective public relations programs.
