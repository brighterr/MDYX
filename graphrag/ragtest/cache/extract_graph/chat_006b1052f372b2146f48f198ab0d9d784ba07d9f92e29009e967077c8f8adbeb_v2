Although English is the dominant language on the Internet, some\nadvertisers who want to provide different websites for different countries have trouble ensuring\nconsistency across all sites. Another issue is exchange rates. Companies must decide whether to\noffer prices in their own currency or in the local currency. For example, one Canadian shopper\nreported that books on a Canadian website were cheaper than the same books on Amazon.com.In\naddition, some companies make different offers available in different countries.\nMarketersmustalsokeepinmindthetechnologicaldifferencesamongtheworldwideInter-\nnetaudiences.Usersinsomecountrieshavetopayper-minutechargesandthereforewanttoget\nonandoffquickly,whichprecludessophisticatedgraphicsthattakealongtimetoload.Inother\ncountries,usershaveaccesstofastlinesandmayexpectmoresophisticatedInternetprogramming.\nIssues in Internet Advertising\nTwo issues online advertisers continue to study are measuring Internet advertising and privacy\nconcerns.\nCHAPTER 13 • DIGITAL MEDIA 413\nMeasurement The advantages of the Internet as a potential advertising vehicle are tremen-\ndous, with rapid, near instantaneous feedback and results chief among them. Rather than wait\nweeks or months to measure the success of a campaign, marketers can instead run ad tests on-\nline, measure meaningful results within days, and quickly invest in the best performers with\nminimal switching costs. One problem, however, is the question of what to measure—readers,\nviewers, visitors, repeat visits, responses, sales? And how do such metrics equate to the reach of\nother media?\nConsiderhits(the number of times a particular site is visited), viewers (the number of view-\ners to a site), unique visitors (the number of different viewers during a particular time period), and\npage views (the number of times viewers view a page). These measures track a consumer through\na website, but they offer no insights as to motivation, nor do they tell us whether a visitor paid any\nattention to the surrounding ads.\nThe primary method currently used to measure consumer response to Internet advertising is\nclick-through (the number of people who click on a banner ad). Many Internet advertisers con-\nsider this measure insufficient, and a host of private research providers have emerged to expand\non that measure. For example, Denver-based Match Logic identifies for its clients what viewers\ndo next after not clicking on a banner ad.\nArecent problem is click fraud,which refers to clicks made either to make money for the\nsponsoring site or to damage a competitor. NewCars.comfound itself under attack with a large\nnumber of clicks coming from Bulgaria, Indonesia, and the Czech Republic. With pay-per-click,\nthe company had to pay a search engine every time a Web surfer clicked on its link. There’s even\na company, Click Forensics, that specializes in detecting click fraud.55\nInternet Targeting and Privacy In addition to providing information, e-businesses also capture\ninformation and use it to direct their marketing communication efforts to make messages more\npersonal and relevant to consumers. This is true for Internet advertising as well as e-mail adver-\ntising and direct marketing, which we will discuss in Chapter 16.\nEvery time you order something from Amazon.com,for example, the company keeps track\nand starts building a profile of your interests. When you go to Amazon the next time, the site will\nprobably open with an announcement about some new book or CD that might interest you. If you\nhave given Amazon permission, it will also send these announcements to you by e-mail. In other\nwords, companies that collect data about the behavior of their customers can better target them\nwith advertising messages and personalized special promotional offers. We referred to this ear-\nlier as behavioral targeting. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) has an online campaign\nthat addresses the privacy issue.\nBut there are other tracking mechanisms, such as cookies,which are little electronic bugs,\nthat can be placed on your computer by a Web server to track your movements online. They don’t\ndo anything bad, like a virus does, but they do report back to their owners what sites you visited\nand from that they build an online profile about you and your interests. On the good side, cookies\nlet companies store information about your preferences so you don’t have to retype everything\nevery time you go to that site.\nAre cookies a bad practice or\ngood? Critics say they are an invasion\nof privacy, but marketers say they are\njustawaytogathermarketinginforma-\ntionwithoutthetedioussurveyorregis-\ntration process. In fact, many people\nrecognizethetrade-off:Iftheyprovide\na company with information, they will\ngetmorepersonalizedserviceinreturn.\nFor more information about how you\ncangetyourInternetserviceproviderto\nremove cookies, check out the website\nwww.webwasher.com.\nMany people have issues with the\nA public service campaign created pro bono by WPP’s Schematic agency, the\ncollection of personal information. Their “Advertising Is Creepy” ads are designed to educate consumers about\nconcern is with how the information is behavioral targeting and privacy issues.\n414 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nused and whether its use violates their privacy. AOL, for example, assembles a huge database of cus-\ntomer information, some of which it sells to other direct marketers. It admits this practice in its pri-\nvacy policy, which is published on its website. It also buys information about its subscribers from\nother outside database suppliers, which it can use to better target\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
