Art directors\nchoose a serif or sans serif\nfont, as well as a font’s\nsize and style, to support\nthe tone of the advertising\nmessage.\nWhere the type sits on the\nad and how it relates to\nthe margin has an effect\non the ad’s overall look.\nHere is a set of different\nsizes for the Times Roman\ntypeface.\nResearch has shown that\nsome typography presen-\ntations, such as those shown\nhere—all cap letters, reverse\ntype, overly ornamental\ntype, and surprinted type—\ncan hinder the reading\nprocess, which creates\na legibility problem.\nFIGURE 10.1\nThe Art of Type\n302 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\n• Typeface variations that come from manipulating the shape of the letterform\n• The edges of the type block and its column width\n• The size in which the type is set (vertical height)\n• Legibility,or how easy it is to perceive the letters.\nGenerally speaking logos are designed to last for a long time, but sometimes brands change\nthe design and typography in an attempt to modernize the look or match the mood of the country.\nAn example comes from the Great Recession period when a number of major brands, such as\nKraft and Walmart, among others moved from their all-cap presentations to lower case. The idea\nwas to make their logos look softer and less stiff.5\nDesign Principles\nThe arrangement of the pieces in a print ad or video shot is governed by basic principles of de-\nsign. The design has both functional and aesthetic needs—the functional side makes the visual\nmessage easy to perceive; the aesthetic side makes it attractive and pleasing to the eye.\nPrinciple These design principles guide the eye by creating a visual path that helps the viewer scan the\nDesign is usually improved elements. For example, dominant elements that are colorful or high in contrast (big versus small,\nby simplifying the number light versus dark) catch the viewer’s attention first. How all of the elements come together is a\nof elements. Less is more. function of the unity and balance of the design. Direction or movement is the way the elements\nare positioned to lead the eye through the arrangement. Simplicity is also a design principle, one\nthat is in opposition to visual clutter. In general, the fewer the elements, the stronger the impact,\nan idea expressed in the phrase “less is more.” Another saying is KISS, which stands for “Keep\nIt Simple, Stupid.” The Frontier “Caribou” ad is a powerful image because of its use of a simple\nhorizontal photo across a two-page spread.\nLet’s look at how these design principles are used in print layout and in the composition of\na picture or photograph.\nSometimes the most powerful images are the simplest in structure—just a wide horizontal landscape with a swimming\ncaribou leaving a trail in the water and a plane flying above him. Notice how the antlers point to the Frontier plane with a\ncaribou on its tail. The whole composition is designed to pull your eye to the right and then up.\nCHAPTER 10 • VISUAL COMMUNICATION 303\nPrint Layout\nFor print advertising, once art directors have chosen the images and typographic elements, they\nmanipulate all of the visual elements on paper to produce a layout. Alayoutis a plan that imposes\norder and at the same time creates an arrangement that is aesthetically pleasing.\nDifferent layouts can convey entirely different feelings about a product. For example, look\nat the two ads for work boots. The ACG “Air Krakatoa” boot ad screams “waterproof!” signaling\nthe boots’ability to stand up to the most serious weather conditions. In contrast, the ad for the\nDunham boot looks like a work of fine art. The difference between the two campaigns clearly lies\nwith the visual impact that comes from the layouts as well as the imagery.\nTypes of Layouts Here are some common types of ad layouts an art director might use:\n• Picture WindowAcommon layout format is one with a single, dominant visual that occu-\npies about 60 to 70 percent of the ad’s space. Underneath it is a headline and copy block.\nThe logo or signature signs off the message at the bottom. The Altoids ads are of this style.\n• All ArtThe art fills the frame of the ad and the copy is embedded in the picture. The Frontier\n“Caribou” ad is an example.\n• Panel or GridThis layout uses a number of visuals of matched or proportional sizes. If the\nad has multiple panels all of the same size, the layout can look like a window pane or comic\nstrip panel. The Dunham boot ad uses two side-by-side panels.\n• Dominant Type or All CopyOccasionally, you will see layouts that emphasize the type\nrather than the art, or even an all-copy advertisement in which the headline is treated as type\nart, such as the ACG ad. Acopy-dominant ad may have art, but it is either embedded in the\ncopy or placed in a subordinate position, such as at the bottom of the layout.\n• CircusThis layout combines lots of elements—art, type, color—to deliberately create a\nbusy, jumbled image. This is typical of some discount store ads or ads for local retailers,\nsuch as tire companies.\n• NonlinearThis contemporary style of layout can be read starting at any point in the image. In\nother words, the direction of viewing is not ordered, as in the “What a Ride”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
