There are three primary tech-\nniques: coincidental surveys, attitude tests, and tracking studies. The first two assess communi-\ncation responses; tracking studies evaluate actual behavior.\nThecoincidental surveytechnique is most often used with broadcast media. Random calls\nare made to individuals in the target market. By discovering what stations or shows people are\ntuned to, the researcher can determine whether the target audience has seen/heard the ad and, if\nso, what information or meaning the audience members now have of the brand. This technique\ncan be useful in identifying basic problems. For example, several years ago Pepsi discovered that\nthe use of Madonna as a spokesperson was a terrible mistake.\nInChapter4wediscussedtherelationshipbetweenanattitude—afavorableorunfavorable\ndispositiontowardaperson,brand,idea,orsituation—andconsumerbehavior.Thisrelationship\nisthebasisofattitudetests.Researcherssurveyindividualswhowereexposedtothead,asking\nquestionsaboutthespokesperson,thetoneofthead,itswording,andsoforth.Resultsthatshow\nstrongnegativeattitudescoresmayprompttheadvertisertopullanadimmediately.Afavorable\nattitudeindicatesthatpeoplearemorelikelytopurchaseabrandthaniftheyhaveanunfavorable\nattitude.\nTracking Studies Studies that periodically (generally every three or six months) measure top-\nof-mind brand awareness (first brand mentioned) are called tracking studies.These studies can\n586 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nA MATTER OF PRACTICE\nFinding Moments of Truth\nCharles E.
