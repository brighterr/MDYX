As Mendelsohn says, “Behind every famously great idea, there is a perhaps with the interests of the\nless flashy, but immensely powerful insight.” Insights are the fuel that fires the ideas. Agreat in- consumer and the features\nof the brand.\nsight always intersects with the interests of the consumer and the features of the brand by identi-\nfying the value that the brand has for the consumer.\nThrough the process of strategic and critical thinking, the planner interprets consumer re-\nsearch in terms of a key consumer insight that uncovers the relevance factor—the reason why\nconsumers care about a brand message. Consumer insights reveal the inner nature of consumers’\nthinking, including such things as mind-sets, moods, motivations, desires, aspirations, and mo-\ntives that trigger their attitudes and actions.\nFinding the “a-ha” in a stack of research reports, data, and transcripts, which is referred to\nasinsight mining,is the greatest challenge for an account planner. The Account Planning Group\n(APG) association describes this process on its website (www.apg.org.uk) as “peering into nooks\nand crannies without losing sight of the big picture in order to identify a key insight that can trans-\nform a client’s business.”\nMendelsohn describes insight mining as “a deep dive” into the meaning of a brand look-\ning for “major truths.” She explains that the planner engages in unearthing the relationship (if\nthere is any) that a target audience has with a brand or product and what role that brand plays\nin their lives. Understanding the brand/consumer relationship is important because account\nplanners are taking on the position of the agency’s brand steward. As Abigail Hirschhorn, chief\nstrategic planning officer at DDB explains, “Our work puts our clients in touch with the souls\nof their brands.”26\nThe account planning tool kit is made up of questions that lead to useful insights culled from\nresearch. Here is a set of questions that can lead to useful insights:\n• What is a realistic response objective (perception, knowledge, feelings, attitudes, symbolic\nmeanings, behavior) for this target group?\n• What are the causes of their lack of response?\n• What are the barriers to the desired response?\n• What could motivate them to respond in the desired way?\n• What is the role of each element in the communication mix to motivate them or remove a\nbarrier?\n214 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nHere’s an example of how data analysis works: Imagine you are working on a cookie ac-\ncount. Here’s your brand share information:\n2009 Share (%) 2010 Share (%)\nChoco Nuts (your brand) 50 40\nSweet ’n Crunchy (your main competitor) 25 30\nWhat’s the problem with this situation? Obviously your brand is losing market share to your\nprimary competitor. As a result, one of your goals might be to use a marketing communication\nmix to drive higher levels of sales. But that goal is so broad that it would be difficult to determine\nwhether communication is sufficient to solve the problem. Let’s dig deeper and consider another\nset of data about household (HH) purchases in a year.\n2009 HH Purchases 2010 HH Purchases\nChoco Nuts 4 3\nSweet ’n Crunchy 2.5 3\nWhat problem can you identify here? It looks like your loyal brand users are reducing their\npurchases at the same time Sweet ‘n Crunchy customers are increasing their purchases. It may\neven be that some of your customers are switching over to Sweet ’n Crunchy. Astrategy based on\nthis information might be to convince people that your brand tastes better and to remind your\nloyal customers of the reasons they have preferred your brand. Those goals can be accomplished\nby marketing\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
