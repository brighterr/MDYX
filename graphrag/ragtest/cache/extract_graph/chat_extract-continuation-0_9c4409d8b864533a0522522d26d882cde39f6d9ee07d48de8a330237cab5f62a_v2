He defines MPR as the process\nof planning and delivering programs that encourage sales and contribute to customer satisfaction\nby providing communication that addresses the needs and wants of consumers.\nMPR is different from a more general public relations approach in its consumer, brand, and\nsales focus. However, the need to establish a credibility platform is similar in both; that’s what\nPR brings to marketing and is PR’s greatest strength in an integrated marketing communication\nprogram. In other words, MPR supports marketing’s product and sales focus by increasing the\nbrand’s credibility with consumers.\nAnexampleofMPRisapublicrelationspushengagedinrecentlybysomeschooldistricts\ntorecruitstudentsandthestatefundingthataccompanieshigherenrollments.Washington,D.C.,\nandDenverPublicSchooldistrictsaretwoexamplesofpublicschoolshopingtocommunicate\na positive image, attract more students and convince voters to support school levies and bond\nissues.16\nThis has been a review of different types of public relations programs and should give you\na sense of the breadth of the activities, as well as the career opportunities in this field.
