An old advertising axiom is “Use a rifle, not a\nshotgun.” In other words, use the headline to tightly target the right audience.\n• Stop and GrabThe headline must work in combination with the visual to stop and grab the\nreader’s attention. An advertisement by Range Rover shows a photo of the car parked at the\nedge of a rock ledge in Monument Valley with the headline, “Lots of people use their Range\nRovers just to run down to the corner.”\n• IdentifyThe headline must also identify the product and brand and start the sale. The selling\npremise should be evident in the headline.\n• Change Scanning to ReadingThe headline should lead readers into the body copy. For\nreaders to move to the body copy, they have to stop scanning and start concentrating. This\nchange in mind-set is the reason why only 20 percent of scanners become readers.\nHeadlinescanbegroupedintotwogeneralcategories:directactionandindirectaction.Direct-\nactionheadlinesarestraightforwardandinformative,suchas“KeepYourBodyStrong,”whichis\noneinaseriesof“HealthyPeople”postersforJohnson&Johnson.Thecopyassociatesthehealth\nofyourbodywiththehealthofnature.Itcloseswithalinethatpullsthesetwothoughtstogether:\n“Yourbodyisjustlikenature.Keepitstrongwithdailyphysicalactivityandbringyourplanetto\nbalance.”Notehowthisstructureofthemessageisconsistentinthe“Mind”and“Spirit”posters.\nDirect-action headlines are highly targeted, but they may fail to lead the reader into the mes-\nsage if they are not captivating enough. Indirect-action headlinesare not as selective and may\nnot provide as much information, but may be better at drawing the reader into the message and\nbuilding a brand image.\nHere are some common types of direct-action headlines:\n• AssertionAn assertion is a headline that states a claim or a promise that will motivate some-\none to try the product.\n• CommandAcommand headline politely tells the reader to do something.\n• How-to HeadsPeople are rewarded for investigating a product when the message tells them\nhow to use it or how to solve a problem.\n• News AnnouncementsNews headlines are used with new-product introductions, but also\nwith changes, reformulations, new styles, and new uses. The news value is thought to get at-\ntention and motivate people to try the product.\nCHAPTER 9 • COPYWRITING 269\nkeep your mind flowing. keep your spirit pure.\nEven though you can't see it, the air\nThe ocean is always moving to\nis always breathing life into the\nkeep the world fresh and healthy.\nEarth.

Puzzling statements, ambi-\nguities, and questions require the reader to examine the body copy to get the answer or ex-\nplanation. The intention is to pull readers into the body copy.\n• AssociationsThese headlines use image and lifestyle to get attention and build interest.\nAn ad for the Motorola Talk About™two-way radio demonstrates the problem of bad re-\nception in the headline: “Help, I Think I Need a Tourniquet!” That headline then draws us into\nthe underline which makes the point that, if the reception isn’t clear, the headline can sound like\n“Well, I think I’ll eat a turnip cake!” This headline, which played with the similar sounds of\nwords, and other curiosity-provoking lines are provocative and compel people to read on to find\nout the point of the message. Sometimes these indirect headlines are called “blind headlines” be-\ncause they give so little information. Ablind headlineis a gamble. If it is not informative or in-\ntriguing enough, the reader may move on without absorbing any product name information, but\nif it works as an attention getter, it can be very effective.\n270 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nHow to Write Other Display Copy\nNext to the headline, captions have the second highest readership.
