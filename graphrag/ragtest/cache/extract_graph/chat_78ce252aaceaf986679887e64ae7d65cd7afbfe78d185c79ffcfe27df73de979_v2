How did the purchase process happen? Was it\nsomething you needed or just something you wanted? These are the kinds of questions marketers\nand advertisers ask about their customers. Consumer behavior describes how individuals or\nCHAPTER 5 • SEGMENTING AND TARGETING THE AUDIENCE 131\ngroups select, purchase, use, or dispose of products, as well as the needs and wants that motivate\nthese behaviors. As we proceed through this chapter, keep asking yourself these questions about\nyour own consumer behavior and that of your friends and family.\nAs our opening story stressed, marketing communication planners need to understand what\nappeals to customers and why. Then they need to be able to describe prospective customers us-\ning characteristics that help predict the likelihood that they will respond to a brand message and,\nultimately, buy the brand.\nThere are various ways to segment consumers and target a market. One way is to divide them\nPrinciple\nby the type of market they represent—either business or consumer—this leads to business-to-\nBuyers may not be the\nbusiness(B2B) or business-to-consumer(B2C) marketing strategies. Another way is to refer users and users may not\nto them either as (1) those who shop for and purchase the product (purchasers or customers), be the buyers. Buyers and\n(2) those who actually use the product (users), or (3) influencers—people who help the buyer users often have entirely\nmake a brand choice (children, trendsetters, family, and friends). This distinction is important be- different needs and wants.\ncause purchasers and users can have different needs and wants. In the case of children’s cereals,\nparents (the purchasers) often look for nutritional value and a decent price. In contrast, children\n(the users) may look for a sweet taste and a package with a prize inside.\nBefore we review how consumers make a buying decision, let’s consider the various factors\nthat influence them: their cultural affinities, their family and friends, their personal needs, and\ntheir experiences with a brand. Figure 5.1is a general model of consumer behavior. It is also a vi-\nsual road map for this chapter. We will begin by discussing three types of influences that affect\nthe way consumers make purchasing decisions. Then we’ll use that knowledge to explain how\naudiences are profiled, segmented, and then targeted with specific types of messages.\nFIGURE 5.1\nPsychological\nInfluences on Consumer\nInfluences\nDecision Making\nState of Mind\nNeeds and Wants\nSelective Perception\nSatisfaction\nMotivations\nAttitudes and Values\nPersonality\nPsychographics\nSocial/Cultural Behavioral\nInfluences Influences\nCulture Consumer Quantity Usage\nSocial class Decision Brand Relationship\nReference groups Innovation\nMaking\nFamily\nDemographics\nMarket Segment\nTarget Audience\n132 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nCultural Influences\nCP(cid:2)Bisknownforadvertisingthatweavesculturalinsightsintosometimesoff-the-walladvertis-\ningmessages,aswiththeOldNavySuperModelquins.Inotherwords,marketingcommunication\nthatmovespeopleoftenbuildsonorconfrontsdeep-seatedculturalvalues.Cultureismadeupof\ntangible items (art, literature, buildings, furniture, clothing, and music) and intangible concepts\n(history, knowledge, laws, morals, customs, and even standards of beauty) that together define a\ngroupofpeopleorawayoflife.Cultureislearnedandpassedonfromonegenerationtothenext.\nGenerally culture is seen as providing a deep-seated context for marketing communication,\nbut popular culture—what we see on television, sports, fashion, and music among other areas—\nis dynamic. Lee Clow, chairman and chief creative direct of TBWA/Worldwide, who also created\nthe legendary “1984” Macintosh commercial discussed in Chapter 1, observed that “you have to\ndo advertising at the speed of culture.” He was referring to the transformation brought by the In-\nternet and other new forms of digital communication, but his point is that “culture is moving very\nfast and it’s very responsive.”1\nNorms and Values The boundaries each culture establishes for “proper” behavior are norms,\nwhich are simply rules we learn through social interaction that specify or prohibit certain behav-\niors. The source of norms is our values,particularly cultural values, which represent our under-\nlying belief systems. In the United States, we value freedom, independence, and individualism;\nin other countries, particularly some Asian and Latin countries, people value families and groups\nmore than individualism. Of course, there are some universals—most people value good health\nand most women want to look good. An example of ads that appeal to Americans’nostalgia is the\n76 campaign aimed at truckers.\nValues are few in number and hard to change.
