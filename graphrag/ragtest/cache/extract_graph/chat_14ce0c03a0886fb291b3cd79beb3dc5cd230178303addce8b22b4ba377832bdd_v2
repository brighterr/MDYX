Another variation allows advertisers to market their\nproducts on other branded websites without sending people away from the site they’re visit-\ning. General Motors, for example, has used a mini-site on the Shell Oil site, which the\nviewer can access and enlarge later. This type of advertising generally gets a higher click\nrate than banners or display ads; the portal About.comestimates that 5 percent of the people\nwho see the sites click on them.\n• Superstitialsare thought of as the “Internet’s commercial” and are designed to work like\nTVads.
