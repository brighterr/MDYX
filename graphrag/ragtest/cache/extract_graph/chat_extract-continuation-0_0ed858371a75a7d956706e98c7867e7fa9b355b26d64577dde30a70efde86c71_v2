However, interactive communicationsuch as Ogilvy’s idea of advertising\nas personal conversation, is two-way communication—a dialogue or conversation—and market-\ning communication is moving in that direction. The difference between one-way and two-way\ncommunication is that two-way communication,is interactive, and the source and receiver change\npositions as the message bounces back and forth between them (think ping-pong)—the source be-\ncomes the listener and the receiver becomes the sender. Figure 4.2is a model of how two-way\ncommunication works.\nThe interest in buzz marketingis an indication of an important trend in marketing commu-\nnication strategy that is moving beyond two-way communication. In social marketing there are\nmultiple conversations occurring in the network. In terms of the old notion of source and receiver,\ninteractive communication means people are contacting companies through the Web or by phone,\n102 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nFIGURE 4.2\nAn Interactive Communication Model\nThe basic communication model is modified here to show how interactive communication works as a conversation or dialogue. Note how the source and\nreceiver change positions as the message bounces back and forth between them.\nand they are talking to one another in a circle of comments about products and brands. As one ex-\npert in interactive telecommunication explained, “We’re living through the largest expansion of\nexpressive capability in the history of the human race.”5Inevitably, that means advertising must\nchange to also become more interactive.\nInteractivity is important because, in addition to a purchase, consumers today can react to a\nmarketing communication message in many other ways: by responding with comments, phone\ncalls, and e-mail inquiries to sales personnel and customer service. They initiate communication,\nas well as receive it. If advertisers want to overcome the impersonal nature of mass communica-\ntion, they need to learn to receive (i.e., listen to) as well as send messages to customers.\nPermission marketingreflects this desire for more interactive and sensitive communication. The\nidea behind permission marketing is that you ask people if it is okay to contact them or you rely\non them to contact you first in order to open the door for follow-up conversation.\nDialoguecreatesnewwaystolistentocustomers.Inthetraditionalcommunicationmodel,cus-\ntomers’responses,orfeedback,aregatheredprimarilythroughresearch,butinnewerapproachesto\ncommunication,feedbackoccursinareal-timeenvironmentofongoingcommunication.Thisfeed-\nbackisachievedbyusingmoreinteractiveformsofmarketingcommunication(personalselling,cus-\ntomerservice,onlinemarketing)andmonitoringtheresponsesandcustomer-initiateddialoguethat\ncomesthroughresponsedevicessuchastoll-freenumbersande-mailaddresses.\nMore than capturing feedback, some companies are designing programs specifically to so-\nlicit ideas from customers and even get them involved in product design using their own web-\nsites, blogs, Facebook, and even Twitter. UserVoice is a San Francisco–based company that sets\nup forums on clients’websites that encourage customers to contribute and vote on ideas.6(Check\nouthttps://uservoice.com.)\nInadditiontolisteningandgeneratingfeedback,theInternethasalsochangedourconversa-\ntionsinwaysDavidOgilvywouldneverhavedreamed.Forexample,textingusesashorthandcode\nwithanentirelynewsetofspellingcodes.Twitterlimitsconversationto140charactersandhasmade\nbrevitycool.Andnowhashtags,whicharemashed-togetherphrasesmarkedwithahashsymbol\n(thepoundsign)thatindicateswhattopicthetweetaddresses,havecreatedanewwayoforganiz-\ninginformation.Thehashtagislikeapauseinaconversationwherethespeakersays,“whatwe’re\ntalkingabouthereisthefutureofnewspapers(#futureofnewspapers).Thehashtagisalsoalinkthat\nmakesitpossibletoinstantlysearchtheInternetforothercommentsonthattopic.7\nTwo-way communication is one of the objectives of an integrated marketing communication\n(IMC)-focused program because it helps create long-term customer relationships with a brand.\nThe growth of permission marketing,a practice that invites consumers to sign up for messages or\nself-select themselves into a brand’s target market, mirrors the shift from one-way to two-way\ncommunication. It’s a way to build a respectful relationship with a customer.\nWHAT ARE THE EFFECTS BEHIND EFFECTIVENESS?\nWhat are the effects that make an advertisement effective? Consider your favorite commercials—\ndo they grip you emotionally? (Think Hallmark and Dove soap.) Do they have a compelling\nmessage? (The “1984” commercial we introduced in Chapter 1is a good example.) How about\nlearning something—do you think about things because of something you heard or read in an ad?\nCHAPTER 4 • HOW MARKETING COMMUNICATION WORKS 103\n(Think the Wii campaign.)
