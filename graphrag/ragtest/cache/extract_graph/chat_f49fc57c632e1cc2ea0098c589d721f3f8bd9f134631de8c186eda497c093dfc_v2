These participant observers then\nmeet with the company’s managers, planners, and marketing staff to discuss their impressions.19\nThe case of Eight O’Clock coffee is an example of the use of a videotaped ethnographic study.\nThe brand’s agency, New York–based Kaplan Thaler, got 14 families in Pittsburgh and Chicago\nto use video cameras to record their typical mornings in order to identify the various roles that\ncoffee played in their morning rituals.20\nDirect observation and ethnographic research have the advantage of revealing what people\nactually do, as distinguished from what people say they do. It can yield the correct answer when\nfaulty memory, a desire to impress the interviewer, or simple inattention to details would cause\nan interview answer to be wrong. The biggest drawback to direct observation is that it shows what\nis happening, but not why. Therefore, the results of direct observation often are combined with\npersonal interviews afterward to provide a more complete and more understandable picture of at-\ntitudes, motives, and behavior.\nThe McCann agency is dedicating a $2.5 million research effort to understanding the lives of\nlow-income Latinos from Mexico to Chile.21Anew division named “Barrio” studies the marketing\nefforts of its clients, such as Nestlé and Danone. It has transformed conference rooms into “bode-\ngas” (corner grocery shops) and sent employees to live with families amassing some 700 hours of\nvideo recordings. The reason is that practical insights into low-income groups are hard to find,\nyet these people are consumers, too, and marketers need to understand their needs as emerging\neconomies bring new lifestyles to the disadvantaged.\nDiaries Sometimes consumers are asked to record their activities through the use of diaries.\nThesediariesare particularly valuable in media research because they tell media planners exactly\nwhat programs and ads the consumers watched. If comment lines are provided, then the activi-\nties can also be accompanied by thoughts. Beeper diaries are used as a way to randomize the\nrecording of activities. Consumers participating in the study are instructed to grab the diary and\nrecord what they are doing when the beeper goes off. Diaries are designed to catch the consumer\nin a more realistic, normal life pattern than you can derive from surveys or interviews that rely on\nconsumers to remember their activities accurately. This can also lead to a helpful reconstruction\nof a typical day in the life of a consumer.\nAnexamplecomesfromDunkin’Donuts.ReginaLewis,formerlyvicepresidentofconsumer\nandbrandinsights,explainedthatsheusedayoungadultdiarystudytodeterminewhenthistarget\naudiencestartsdrinkingcoffee.Sherecruited20peopleinfivecities.Fromtheirrecords,Lewisand\nher team had hundreds of points of observations.At research centers, the participants were then\naskedtoexplainwhatwasgoingonwhentheythoughtabouthavingcoffee—whatday,whattime,\nwhyaretheythinkingaboutcoffee,andsoforth.Fromthatresearch,theteamlearnedthatmany\nyoungadultswant“chuggable”coffee,particularlybecausetheywantanimmediatecaffeinehit.As\naresult,theydrinkicedcoffeebecausehotcoffeeistoohotandtheycan’tgettheircaffeineshotfast\nenough.Dunkin’respondedwith“TurboIce”coffeewithanextrashotofespresso.22\n182 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nOther Qualitative Methods Marketing communication planners are always probing for rea-\nsons, feelings, and motivations behind what people say and do. To arrive at useful consumer\ninsights, they use a variety of interesting and novel research methods. In particular, they use sto-\nries and pictures. Cognitive psychologists have learned that human beings think more in images\nthan in words. Most research continues to use words to ask questions and obtain answers, but re-\ncent experiments with visual-based research opens up new avenues of expression that may be bet-\nter able to uncover people’s deep thoughts.\nResearchers use pictures, as well as other tools to uncover mental processes that guide con-\nsumer behavior. Professor Larry Soley refers to these methods as projective techniques,which\nmeans they ask respondents to generate impressions rather than respond to more controlled quan-\ntitative surveys and rating systems. He describes projective techniques as psychoanalytic.23\nHarvard Business School professor Gerald Zaltman believes that the conventional wisdom\nabout consumer research, such as using interviews and focus groups that rely on talking to peo-\nple and grilling them about their tastes and buying habits, is only good for getting back predictable\nanswers. If you ask people what they think about Coke, you’ll learn that it is a “high-energy,\nthirst-quenching, fun-at-the-beach” kind of drink. But that may not be an adequate description of\nhow people really feel about the soft drink.24\nHereisacollectionofsomeofthemoreimaginativewaysqualitativeresearchersuseprojec-\ntivetechniquesas\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
