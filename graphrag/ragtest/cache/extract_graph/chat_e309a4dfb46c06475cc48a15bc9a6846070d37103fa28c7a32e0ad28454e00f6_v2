Well, Flip had had enough. He decided to offer Frontier an ultimatum:\nEither they send him to Mexico, or he would quit.”\nCouzens and Ennis conceptualized the commercials as a news story which would\nunfold and evolve in real time. The “Flip to Mexico” campaign featured ads with Flip,\nfake news spots on Flip’s demand that he be allowed to fly to Mexico, staged\nprotests, podcasts, blogs, Flip’s anthem on iTunes, and a Flipmobile that was con-\nspicuous around Denver to generate awareness. Fans caught the spirit and started\ndemonstrating on Flip’s behalf. The four-week campaign culminated in an ad that\nplayed during the Super Bowl announcing that Flip was finally going to Mexico.\n“Leather Seats”\nAnother commercial shows how the concept was extended with different types of\nmessages the airline wanted to deliver. Jack the Rabbit and Larry the Lynx an-\nnounce new aircraft, new destinations and new seats in one commercial. The bril-\nliant copy captivates the audience, as these two characters ponder why there are\nnot any cows on the tails of the airplanes. They conclude tails with cows probably\nwould not be appropriate, given the new leather seats.\nYouwillreadanothercampaignthatdemonstratestheextendabilityofthetalk-\ninganimalconceptinthecaseopenerforChapter16,whichillustratesagreataward-\nwinningspecialpromotiontogetpassengerstobooktheirFrontierflightson-line.\nWhat can you learn from talking animals?

This chapter explores\nhow the two dimensions come together as creative strategy—the logic behind the message. We also\nexamine how the strategy works with creative ideas to deliver a message’s objectives. This includes\na discussion of a planning tool called a creative brief,which provides direction for the execution of\nthe Big Idea and for the evaluation of the creative strategy. We discuss the characteristics of creative\npeople and the process of creative thinking, with the aim of showing how you can be a more cre-\native thinker. The chapter ends with a discussion of the implementation of creative strategy.\nSCIENCE AND ART?\nEffective advertising is successful because the right media delivers the right message to the right\ntarget audience at the right time. In Part 2 we concentrated on how marketing communication\nworks and how it’s planned, and in Part 4 we’ll consider the media and how a message is deliv-\nered. In Part 3—the next three chapters—we’ll concentrate on how the message is created. It’s\nimportant to keep in mind, however, that like two hands clapping, media and message need to\nwork together to create effective communication. In fact, planning the message usually happens\nsimultaneously with planning the media. Figure 8.1diagrams this relationship.\nCHAPTER 8 • THE CREATIVE SIDE 227\nFIGURE 8.1\nMarketing Communication\nMedia and Message\nPlan and Strategies\nStrategy Work in Parallel\nMessage Planning Media Planning\nThe Creative Target and\nBrief Media Research\nMessage Media\nObjectives Objectives\nBig Idea\nMedia Mix\nSelection\nMessage Execution\nScheduling\nand\nCopywriting Budgeting\nDesign and Media Buying\nProduction\nMedia\nAdaptions for IMC\nTactics\nareas & international\ncampaigns\nMonitoring\nEvaluation\nEvaluation\nObjectives and\nEffects\nCopy Testing\nPerformance\nResults\n228 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nEffective marketing communication is not only focused on media and messages, it’s also a\nproduct of both logic and creativity. The message plan, for example, is a rational analysis of a\nproblem and what’s needed to solve that problem. The advertisement itself translates the logic of\nthe planning decisions into a creative idea that is original, attention getting, and memorable, such\nas the idea of talking animals as “spokes-characters” for Frontier airlines.\nBeyond originality, Stuhlfaut and Berman say that creativity is not an open-ended process—\nit is directed at achieving objectives. They also emphasize that creative strategy is a problem-\nsolving process,1 and problem solving demands creative thinking—the mental tool used in\nfiguring things out. Big Ideas and Big Plans both call for creative thinking.\nIn their book Creative Strategy in Advertising,Drewniany and Jewler say that an ad “needs\nPrinciple\nto contain a persuasive message that convinces people to take action.” To be creative, however,\nEffective advertising is a\nproduct of both science they suggest that the message must connect the target audience to the brand in a relevant and un-\n(persuasion) and art expected way. They explain, “Great advertising starts with a problem from the client and ends\n(creativity). Big Ideas and with a solution for consumers.”2This description of creative advertising supports the principle\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
