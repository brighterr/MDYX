Heavy users typically buy the most of a product category or a brand’s share of Principle\nthe market. An old rule of thumb called the Pareto rule states that 20 percent of the market typi- In many product\ncally buys 80 percent of the products. That explains why the heavy-user category is so important categories, 20 percent of\nto marketers and why planners make special efforts to understand this key customer group. Heavy the users buy 80 percent\nusers and brand loyal buyers are usually a brand’s most important customers, and they are the of the products.\nmost difficult for competitors to switch away from a brand. Switchersare people with low lev-\nels of brand loyalty who may be willing to try a new brand.\nWe mentioned in a previous chapter that experience marketing has become an important\nidea. You know the old saying that “getting there is half the fun.” The experience of shopping, for\nsome women, is as important as, or maybe more important than, what they buy. In a larger sense,\nour decisions are often based on what our experience has been with the brand—how well it per-\nformed, how easy it was to use, how well customer service responded to questions, and so forth.\nInnovation and Adoption Another type of behavior has to do with how willing people are to try\nsomething new and how willing they are to risk buying new products. Everett Rogers developed\nthe classification system which he called the diffusion of innovation curve,to identify innovation\nandadoptionbehaviors. This adoption processis identified in terms of personal behavior and\nhow the behavior reflects the speed with which people are willing to try something new, such as\ninnovators,early adopters,early majority,late majority,andlaggards.37This system is directly\nrelated to the willingness of people to try new products, which reflects the speed of diffusionof\nnew ideas. See Figure 5.6for an interpretation of Rogers’Diffusion of Innovation model.\nThe innovator category, which is the group of brave souls willing to try something new, rep-\nresents only about 2.5 percent of the population. Obviously this group and the early adopter cat-\negory are important groups for marketers launching new products. Risk taking is a personality\ncharacteristic, but it drives behavior in the area of trying a new product. Perceived riskis your\nview of the relationship between what you gain by trying something new and what you have to\nlose if it doesn’t work out. In other words, how important is the consequence of not making a good\ndecision? Price is a huge barrier for high-involvement products; personal status and self-image\nmay be a risk barrier for a fashion product.\nEarly adopters have been studied by SRI International, the consulting company behind the\nVALS segmentation scheme. Its clients often ask for guidance about identifying early adopters of\ninnovative products. Cheri Anderson, an SRI consultant, explains the company has discovered\nthat early adopters:\n• Are people involved in unusual activities and whose level of activity will disproportionately\naffect the behaviors of others\n• Have many weak social contacts\n• Are masters of their own universes\n• Are high media users\n• Have a more complex history of personal and sexual relationships\nWho are these people? SRI’s research has found that “contrary to popular belief, there is no\none innovator or early adopter group but adoption patterns vary with the product category. Early\nadopters are in different strata and roles in society and cannot be identified by demographics\n150 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nFIGURE 5.6\nThe Diffusion of Innovation\nThis version of Rogers' diffusion of Innovation model shows the usual bell curve with data estimating the percentage of people in the standard adaption\ncategories, however, it also presents a percentage line that estimates the cumulative effect of successive groups of consumers adopting a new idea until it\neventually reaches a saturation level.\nSource:Tungsten,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Rogers.Based on Rogers, E. (1962) Diffusion of innovations. Free Press, London, NY, USA.\nalone. Anderson explains why early adopters are important to research firms such as SRI: “By un-\nderstanding what motivates and de-motivates different early adopter groups, we can help our\nclients identify targets and steer their brands for successful market entry.”\nTrends and Fads The phenomenon of trends and fads is related to lifestyle and psychographic\nfactors, as well as the fascination with choice in a consumer culture. We’ve seen “acre homes”\nand fancy bathroom retreats, as well as low-carb diets, healthy food (oat bran, antioxidants), nat-\nural products, fitness fads and personal trainers, hybrid cars, carbon trading, simple life (don’t buy\nthings), and local products (don’t buy things that use a lot of gas in transportation to get to your\nlocal store). Even Girl Scout cookies are trying to appeal to people by using new formulations\nthat are low in trans fats.38\nYoung people are particularly involved in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
