In the Corporate\nAngel Network ad, for example, the headline is\n“Cancer Patients Fly Free.”\n• OverlinesandUnderlinesThese are phrases or\nsentences that either lead into the headline or\nfollow up on the thought in the headline. They\nare usually set in smaller type than the\nheadline. The purpose of the overlineis to set\nthe stage, and the purpose of the underline is\nto elaborate on the idea in the headline and\nserve as a transition to the body copy. The\nunderlineleads into the body copy as\ndemonstrated in the DuPont ad: “Find food\nthat helps prevent osteoporosis.”\n• Body CopyThe text of the ad. It’s usually\nsmaller-sized type and written in paragraphs or\nmultiple lines. Its purpose is to explain the idea\nor selling point.\n• SubheadsUsed in longer copy blocks,\nsubheads begin a new section of the copy.\nThey are usually bold type or larger than the\nbody copy. Their purpose is to make the logic\nclear to the reader. They are useful for people\nwho scan copy and they help them get a sense of what the\ncopy says. The Corporate Angel Network ad uses\nsubheads.\n• Call-OutsThese are sentences that float around the visual,\nusually with a line or arrow pointing to some specific\nelement in the visual that they name and explain. For\nexample, Johnson & Johnson once ran an ad that used call-\nouts as the main pieces of the body copy. The head read:\n“How to bathe a mommy.” Positioned around a picture of\na woman are short paragraphs with arrows pointing to\nvarious parts of her body. These call-outsdescribe the\ngood things the lotion does for feet, hands, makeup\nremoval, moisture absorption, and skin softening.\n• CaptionsA sentence or short piece of copy that explains\nwhat you are looking at in a photo or illustration. Captions\naren’t used very often in advertising because the visuals are\nassumed to be self-explanatory; however, readership\nstudies have shown that, after the headline, captions have\nhigh readership.\n• TaglinesA short phrase that wraps up the key idea or\ncreative concept that usually appears at the end of the\nbody copy. It often refers back to the headline or opening\nphrase in a commercial. For example, see the line, “Need a\nlift? Just give us a call. We’ll do the rest,” in the Corporate\nAngel Network ad.\n• SlogansA distinctive catch phrase that serves as a motto\nfor a campaign, brand, or company. It is used across a\nvariety of marketing communication messages and over an\nextended period of time. “What happens in Las Vegas\nstays in Las Vegas” is a tourism slogan that hints at the\npleasures you don’t enjoy at home.\n• Call to ActionThis is a line at the end of an ad that\nencourages people to respond and gives information on\nhow to respond. Both ads—Corporate Angel Network and\nDuPont—have response information: either an address, a\ntoll-free phone number, an e-mail address, or Web address.\n268 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nattention and communicate the creative concept. This clutter-busting Big Idea breaks through the\ncompetitive messages. It comes across best through a picture and words working together, as the\nDuPont ad illustrates. The headline carries the theme (“To Do List for the Planet”) and the un-\nderline (“Find food that helps prevent osteoporosis”) makes a direct connection with the visual.\nPeople who are scanning may read nothing more, so advertisers want to at least register a\npoint with the consumer. The point has to be clear from the headline or the combination of head-\nline and visual. That’s particularly true with outdoor boards. Researchers estimate that only\n20 percent of those who read the headline in advertising go on to read the body copy, so if they\ntake away anything from the ad, it needs to be clear in the headline.\nPrinciple Headlines need to be catchy phrases, but they also have to convey an idea and attract the\nGood headlines interrupt right target audience. Tobler has won Effie awards for a number of years for its clever headlines\nreaders’ scanning and and visuals. For Tobler’s Chocolate Orange, the creative concept showed the chocolate ball be-\ngrab their attention. ing smacked against something hard and splitting into orange-like slices. The headline was\n“Whack and Unwrap.” The next year the headline was “Smashing Good Taste,” which speaks to\nthe candy’s British origins and to the quirky combination of chocolate and orange flavors. The\nheadline and visual also tell consumers how to “open” the orange into slices—by whacking it.\nAgencies copytest headlines to make sure they can be understood at a glance and that they\ncommunicate exactly the right idea. Split-run tests (two versions of the same ad) in direct mail\npieces have shown that changing the wording of the headline while keeping all other elements\nconstant can double, triple, or quadruple consumer response. That is what experts, such as ad leg-\nend David Ogilvy, state that the headline is the most important element in the advertisement.6Be-\ncause headlines are so important, some general principles guide their development and explain\nthe particular functions they serve:\n• TargetAgood headline will attract only those who are prospects—there is no sense in at-\ntracting people who are not in the market. An old advertising axiom is “Use a rifle, not a\nshotgun.” In other words, use the headline to tightly target the right audience.\n• Stop and GrabThe headline must work in combination with the visual to stop and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE ANGEL NETWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate Angel Network is an organization that provides free flights for cancer patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUPONT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DuPont is a company that creates advertisements, such as one promoting food that helps prevent osteoporosis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON & JOHNSON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Johnson & Johnson is a company known for its advertisements, including one that uses call-outs to describe the benefits of a lotion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOBLER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tobler is a company recognized for its creative advertising, particularly for its Chocolate Orange product)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAS VEGAS<|>GEO<|>Las Vegas is a city known for its tourism slogan \"What happens in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE ANGEL NETWORK<|>DUPONT<|>Both Corporate Angel Network and DuPont are mentioned as examples of organizations using effective advertising techniques<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE ANGEL NETWORK<|>JOHNSON & JOHNSON<|>Both Corporate Angel Network and Johnson & Johnson are mentioned as examples of organizations using effective advertising techniques<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUPONT<|>JOHNSON & JOHNSON<|>Both DuPont and Johnson & Johnson are mentioned as examples of organizations using effective advertising techniques<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOBLER<|>DUPONT<|>Both Tobler and DuPont are mentioned as examples of organizations using effective advertising techniques<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOBLER<|>JOHNSON & JOHNSON<|>Both Tobler and Johnson & Johnson are mentioned as examples of organizations using effective advertising techniques<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAS VEGAS<|>TOBLER<|>Las Vegas and Tobler are both mentioned in the context of effective slogans and advertising<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
