Evaluation of communication for foundations and nonprofit organizations\nis an emerging field, and challenges to assessing effectiveness are many. Activities and behaviors\nbeing measured are complex and campaigns are often a multi-phase effort. There are no standard\nand widely accepted guidelines for communication evaluation for the nonprofit sector. Nonethe-\nless, measuring success of a campaign begins with setting objectives and evaluating the progress\ntoward achieving the objectives.22\nInternational marcom is difficult to evaluate because of market differences (e.g., language,\nlaws, cultural norms) and the acceptability of various research tools. There may also be incompati-\nbilities among various measurement systems and data analysis techniques that make it difficult to\ncompare the data from one market with similar data from another market. An international evalua-\ntion program for advertising should focus, at least initially, on pretesting because unfamiliarity with\ndifferent cultures, languages, and consumer behaviors can result in major miscalculations. Pretest-\ning helps the advertiser correct major problems before miscommunication occurs. To evaluate the\nglobal/local question, the best approach is to test two ads that are both based on the global adver-\ntising strategy: a locally produced version of the advertising and an original ad produced locally.\nCHAPTER 19 • EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS 599\nCampaign and Program Evaluation\nWhileitisidealtoknowhoweachmarketingcommunicationfunctionhasperformed,thereality\ninmostcampaignsisthatavarietyoffunctionsandmediaareusedtoreachandmotivatecustomers\ntorespond.Timeisafactoraswell.Wementionedinthebeginningofthischapterthatthereisa\ndebateaboutadvertising’sabilitytoimpactshort-termsalesresultsaswellaslong-termbranding.\nUniversity of Southern California Professor Gerard Tellis reminds us that advertising not\nonly has instantaneouseffects (consumer responds immediately) but also carryovereffects (de-\nlayed impact).23Any evaluation of campaign effectiveness needs to also be able to track both\ntypes of effects over time. Differential effects also complicate the ongoing evaluation of IMC pro-\ngrams that operate with a 360-degree total communication philosophy, although tracking may be\neasier in some ways because the evaluation is continuous.\nThe Synergy Problem The problem with evaluating campaigns—particularly IMC campaigns—\nis estimating the impact of synergy. Intuitively we know that multichannel communication with\nmessages that reinforce and build on one another will have more impact than single messages\nfrom single sources; however, that can be difficult to prove. As Bob Liodice, CEO of the Associ-\nation of National Advertisers, observes, “there is no single, consistent set of metrics that tran-\nscends discipline-centric measurements.”24\nIf the campaign planning is well integrated, which means each specialty area cooperates with\nall others in message design, delivery, and timing, then there should be a synergistic effect. This\nmeans that the overall results are greater than the sum of the individual functional areas if used\nseparately.\nAnumber of studies have attempted to evaluate IMC impact by comparing campaigns that use\ntwo or three tools to see what is gained when more message sources are added to the mix. For ex-\nample, a study by the Radio Ad Effectiveness Lab reported that recall of advertising is enhanced when\na mix of radio and Internet ads are used rather than just website advertising alone.25Astudy published\nin the Journal of Advertising Researchdeveloped\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
