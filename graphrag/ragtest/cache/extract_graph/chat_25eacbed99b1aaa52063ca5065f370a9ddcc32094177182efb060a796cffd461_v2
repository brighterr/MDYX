Here is the creative brief that shows the thinking behind the\ncampaign:\n• Why are we advertising at all?To create awareness for an evening alternative ride service.\n• What is the message trying to do?Make the new ride service appealing to men in order to\nreduce the number of alcohol-related crashes.\n• What are their current attitudes and perceptions?“My car is here right now. Why wait?\nThere are few options available anyway. I want to keep the fun going all night long.”\n• What is the main promise we need to communicate?It’s more fun when you don’t have to\nworry about driving.\n• What is the key moment to which we tie this message?“Bam! The fun stops when I need to\nthink about getting to the next bar or getting home.”\n232 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\n• What tone of voice should we use?The brand character is rugged, cool, and genuine. We\nneed to be a “straight-shooter” buddy on the barstool next to the target. They do not want to\nbe preached to or told what to do. We need to communicate in a language to which they can\nrelate. (Words like programmay cause our audience to tune out.)\nMessage Objectives In planning creative strategies, what do you want the message to accom-\nplish? What message objectives would you specify for the Road Crew campaign in order to meet\nthe goal of reducing alcohol-related crashes by 5 percent?\nSome experts say advertising’s role is to create awareness or announce something; others\nsay it is to inform or persuade.4Hard-nosed businesspeople say the only real objective is to create\nsales. In some cases, the objective is to build or change demand for a brand. In Chapters 4and 7,\nwe introduced the concept of the Facets Model of Effects(Figure 8.3). Here is a review of some\ncommon advertising objectives that relate to the most critical facets of effectiveness:\n• See/hearCreate attention, awareness, interest, recognition.\n• FeelTouch emotions and create feelings.\n• Think/UnderstandDeliver information, aid understanding, create recall.\n• ConnectEstablish brand identity and associations, transform a product into a brand with dis-\ntinctive personality and image.\n• BelieveChange attitudes, create conviction and preference, stimulate trust.\n• Act/DoStimulate trial, purchase, repurchase, or some other form of action, such as visiting a\nstore or website.\nOf course, these effects are also driven by the demands of the marketing situation, target au-\ndience insights, and the needs of the brand. We mentioned that the primary goal of the Road Crew\ncampaign was to reduce the number of alcohol-related crashes. Other objectives involved creat-\ning awareness of the ride service program and positive attitudes toward it and establishing a cost-\nFIGURE 8.3\nFacets Model of Effects\nsee/hear feel\nPerception Emotion\nthink/understand believe\nCognition Persuasion\nconnect act\nAssociation Behavior\nCHAPTER 8 • THE CREATIVE SIDE 233\nefficient level of rides in the first year of operations, which involved fund-raising, the solicitation\nof volunteers, and other community support. The heart of the problem uncovered by the Road\nCrew research, however, was a gap between awareness (don’t drink & drive), attitudes (risky,\nscary, potentially dangerous), and behavior(get someone else to drive). The campaign was de-\nsigned to address this gap and encourage the target audience’s behavior to change in accordance\nwith their attitudes and awareness.\nTargeting The target decision is particularly important in planning a message strategy. For\nexample, we mentioned in the media chapters that advertisers have a difficult time reaching\nyoungmen.NewcableTVprograms,aswellasWebandcellphoneopportunities,aredevel-\nopingtodeliverthiscriticaldemographic,butwhatshouldthemessagesayinthesenewme-\ndiaformats?\nThe target audience for the Wisconsin Road Crew campaign was identified as 21- to 34-year-\nold single men with a high school education and employed in blue-collar jobs. They were the pri-\nmary target for the ride service because research found that this group is responsible for the most\nalcohol-related crashes, they kill more people than any other age group, and they themselves\nare most likely to die in an alcohol-related crash. What moves this group? Research found that\nmany of these guys tended to worry about driving home drunk as the\nend of the evening approached and this worry took the edge off an oth-\nerwise delightful end of the evening. So the ride service made their\nevening more fun because it reduced their worry.\nBranding and Positioning The demands of the brand are also impor-\ntant considerations. Brand positions and brand images are created\nthrough message strategies and brought to life through advertising ex-\necutions. Finding the right position is difficult enough, but figuring out\nhow to communicate that position in an attention-getting message that\nis consistent across multiple executions and various media is difficult.\nThe classic “Think Small” campaign that launched the VWBeetle is\nan example of advertising that created a powerful brand at the same\ntime it carved out a unique position in a cluttered automobile market.\nBrand communication creates symbols and cues that make brands\ndistinctive, such as characters, colors, slogans, and taglines, as well as\nbrand personality cues. Burger King has taken on market leader Mc-\nDonald’s by being cool, as evidenced by the power of its icon with an\nattitude—the Burger King king, which is only one of a group of brand\nicons that lend personality, emotion, and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
