Often, one company’s weakness is another company’s opportunity. Planners strive\nto identify these opportunities and leverage them in the brand’s advertising.\n• Athreatis a trend or development in the environment that will erode business unless the\ncompany takes action. Competition and economic downturns are common threats. Advertis-\nCHAPTER 7 • STRATEGIC PLANNING 197\ning planners ask themselves how they can address a threat if it is a critical factor affecting\nthe success of the brand.\nIn the Coke Zero case, the strength of the brand lies with the Coca-Cola tradition as “the real\nthing.” The opportunity existed to transfer that Coke magic to a calorie-free version of the flag-\nship brand. The weakness is the association of diet drinks with women. The threat lies with the\nidea that “diet drinks” have an unpleasant taste.\nKey Problem(s) The key word in the title of this section is analysis,or making sense of all the\ndata collected and figuring out what the information means for the future success of the brand.\nAdvertising planners must analyze the market situation for communication problems that affect\nthe successful marketing of a product, as well as opportunities the advertising can create or ex-\nploit. Analyzing the SWOTs and identifying any problems that can be solved with an advertising\nmessage are at the heart of strategic thinking. An example of locating a timing opportunity is il-\nlustrated by the Special K “2-Week Challenge” that capitalized on consumers’ goals to lose\nweight after the holidays.\nAdvertising can solve only message-related problems such as image, attitude, perception,\nandknowledgeorinformation.Itcannotsolveproblemsrelatedtoprice,availability,orquality,\nalthoughitcanaddresstheperceptionofthesemarketingmixfactors.Forexample,amessagecan\nspeaktotheperceptionthatthepriceistoohigh,oritcanportrayaproductwithlimiteddistribu-\nPrinciple\ntionasexclusive.Inotherwords,advertisingcanaffectthewayconsumersperceiveprice,avail-\nAdvertising can only solve\nability,andquality.Theadvertiser’sbasicassumption,however,isthatthecampaignworksifit message-related or\ncreatesanimpression,influencespeopletorespond,andseparatesthebrandfromthecompetition. perception problems.\nSHOWCASE\nThis two-week Kellogg’s Special K challenge promises customers they will lose up to six pounds\nin two weeks by replacing two meals a day with Special K and eating a sensible third meal. Reaching\nconsumers at the moment they are in need of a weight-loss solution and delivering a simple diet in the\ncontext of their environment—in this case posters in department store dressing rooms, health clubs,\ndoctor’s offices, hair or nail salons, and bridal salons—was very effective. Business results included an\noverall increase in the poster markets of 20 percent over nonposter markets.\nThese two posters for Special K were contributed by Amy Hume, communications\nconsultant in the Integrated University Communications office at the University of\nColorado–Denver. Hume is a graduate of the University of Colorado–Boulder\nand was an associate media director at Starcom Worldwide where she\nhandled this mini-campaign for Special K. She and her work were nominated\nfor inclusion in this book by professor Tom Duncan.\n198 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nObjectives\nAfter planners have examined the external and internal environments and defined the critical areas\nthat need to be addressed, they can develop specific objectives to be accomplished during a spec-\nified time period. Objectivesare formal statements of the goals of the advertising or other mar-\nketing communication. They outline what the message is designed to achieve in the long term and\nhow it will be measured.\nMain Effects and Objectives Remember from Chapter 4the six categories in The Facets Model\nof Effects: perception, emotion, cognition, persuasion, association, and behavior. These main ef-\nfects also can be used to identify the most common consumer-focused objectives. For example,\nhere are some sample objectives for each category, as well as sample ads and campaigns that we\nhave discussed in this or previous chapters:\n• Perception ObjectivesGrab attention; create awareness; stimulate interest; stimulate recog-\nnition of the brand or the message; create brand reminder.\nExample:“1984” ad for Macintosh launch\n• Emotional/Affective ObjectivesTouch emotions; cue the psychological appeal; create brand\nor message liking; stimulate brand loyalty; stimulate desire.\nExample:Burger King “Whopper Freakout” campaign\n• Cognition ObjectivesEstablish brand identity; establish or cue the brand position; deliver\ninformation; aid in understanding features, benefits, and brand differences; explain how to\ndo or use something; stimulate recall of the brand message; stimulate brand loyalty; brand\nreminder.\nExample:“Wii would like to play” launch\nThe Facets Model of Effects\nsee/hear feel\nPerception Emotion\nthink/understand believe\nCognition Persuasion\nconnect act\nAssociation Behavior\nCHAPTER 7 • STRATEGIC PLANNING 199\n• Association ObjectivesEstablish or cue the brand personality or image; create links to sym-\nbols and associations; connect to positive brand experiences.\nExamples:Ford’s “SYNC” campaign for Hispanics, Old Navy’s “SuperModelquins”\n• Persuasion ObjectivesStimulate opinion or attitude formation; change or reinforce opinion or\nattitude; present argument and reasons; counterargue; create conviction or belief; stimulate\nbrand preference or intent to try or buy; reward positive or desired response; stimulate brand\nloyalty; create buzz or word of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COCA-COLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Coca-Cola is a globally recognized beverage company known for its flagship product, Coke, which is marketed as \"the real thing.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COKE ZERO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Coke Zero is a calorie-free version of Coca-Cola's flagship brand, designed to capture the magic of Coke without the calories.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPECIAL K<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Special K is a brand of breakfast cereal produced by Kellogg's, known for its weight-loss challenge that involves replacing meals with Special K products.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KELLOGG'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kellogg's is a multinational food manufacturing company known for its breakfast cereals, including Special K.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMY HUME<|>PERSON<|>Amy Hume is a communications consultant at the University of Colorado–Denver and a former associate media director at Starcom Worldwide, involved in the Special K campaign.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO–DENVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Colorado–Denver is an educational institution where Amy Hume works as a communications consultant.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STARCOM WORLDWIDE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Starcom Worldwide is a media agency where Amy Hume worked as an associate media director, handling campaigns like Special K.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOM DUNCAN<|>PERSON<|>Tom Duncan is a professor who nominated Amy Hume and her work for inclusion in a book.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COCA-COLA<|>COKE ZERO<|>Coke Zero is a product of Coca-Cola, designed to offer a calorie-free version of the traditional Coke<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPECIAL K<|>KELLOGG'S<|>Special K is a product line of Kellogg's, focusing on weight-loss solutions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY HUME<|>SPECIAL K<|>Amy Hume contributed to the Special K campaign as a communications consultant<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY HUME<|>UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO–DENVER<|>Amy Hume works as a communications consultant at the University of Colorado–Denver<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMY HUME<|>STARCOM WORLDWIDE<|>Amy Hume was an associate media director at Starcom Worldwide, where she handled the Special K campaign<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOM DUNCAN<|>AMY HUME<|>Tom Duncan nominated Amy Hume and her work for inclusion in a book<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
