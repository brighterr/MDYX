Typically, the higher the purchase level, the greater\nthe benefits.\nToday loyalty programs are synonymous with the word frequent.The frequent flyer club,\nfirst created by United and American Airlines in 1981, is the model for a modern continuity pro-\ngram. These programs offer a variety of rewards, including seat upgrades, free tickets, and pre-\nmiums based on the number of frequent flyer miles accumulated. Although the frequent flyer\nprograms were originally established to create customer loyalty, they have turned into a rewards\nprogram. For example, people can earn miles through credit card purchases. Continuity programs\nwork in competitive markets in which the consumer has difficulty perceiving real differences be-\ntween brands. TGI Friday’s, for example, has used a “Frequent Fridays” program with several\nmillion members. The key to creating a successful loyalty program is offering memorable incen-\ntives that consumers want.\nMarketerslikemembershipprogramsbecausetheyalsogenerateinformationforcustomer\ndatabases. The enrollment application at TGI Friday’s, for example, captures name, address,\ntelephone number, birth date, and average visit frequency. The database can also record the\nrestaurant locations, date, time, purchase amount, and items ordered on each visit.

In brand licensing, a\ncompany with an established brand “rents” that brand to\nother companies, allowing them to use its logo on their prod-\nucts and in their advertising and promotional events. Fashion\nmarketers such as Gucci, Yves St. Laurent, and Pierre Cardin\nhave licensed their brand names and logos for use on every-\nthing from fashion accessories to sunglasses, ties, linens, and\nluggage, and they do this because it makes them money and\nextends their brand visibility. The PGATour is a golf brand\nthat has become recognizable through an elaborate, inte-\ngrated marketing campaign. Charles Schwab, the financial\ninvestment house, has used the PGATour logo as a part of its\nadvertising. This lets the company associate its brand with a\ngolf event that has a lot of interest and positive associations\nfor the target audiences.\nTie-Ins and Cross Promotions Another type of cooperative\nmarketing program is a tie-inorcross promotion,which is\nan effective strategy for marketers using associations be-\ntween complementary brands to make one plus one equal\nthree.
