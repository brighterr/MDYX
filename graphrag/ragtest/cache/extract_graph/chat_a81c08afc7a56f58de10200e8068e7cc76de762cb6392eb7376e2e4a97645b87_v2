Human footwear maker Teva created sandals for\nan Asian elephant with foot problems. The result was an article and photo that ran as a news items.\nPR expert Tom Harris calls this type of media coverage “an endorsement that money can’t buy.”29\nMedia relations is often seen as the most important core competency for PR professionals.\nMedia relations specialists know media that would be interested in stories about their companies.\nThey also develop personal contacts with reporters and editors who write regularly on topics\nrelated to their organization’s industry. As Carole Howard, author of a media relations book, ex-\nplains, “Good media contacts proliferate once they are established.”30In addition to personal con-\ntact, the primary tool used in media relations is the news release, along with press conferences\nand media tours.\nNews Releases Thenews releaseis the primary medium used to deliver public relations mes-\nsages to the various external media. Although the company distributing the news release controls\nits original form and content, the media decide what to present and how to present it. What the\npublic finally sees, then, is not necessarily what the originating company had in mind, and so this\nform of publicity offers less control to the originating company.\nThe decision to use any part of a news release is based on an editor’s judgment of its news\nvalue.News valueis based on such considerations as timeliness (something just happened or\nis about to happen), proximity (a local angle), impact (importance or significance), or human\ninterest.\nNews releases must be written differently for each medium, accommodating space and time\nlimitations. Traditional journalism form is followed, which means the 5Wformat is standard—in\nother words, the release should lead with answers to questions of who, what, why, when, where,\nand how. The more carefully the news release is planned and written, the better the chance it has\nof being accepted and published as written. Note the tight and simple writing style in the news\nrelease from global public relations and communication firm Weber Shandwick.\nThe news release can be delivered in a number of ways—in person, by local deliveryservice,\nby mail, by fax, or by e-mail. Sometimes a company is hired that specializes in distribution, such\nas the U.S. Newswire. Originally these companies sent news releases by mail or delivery services,\nCHAPTER 15 • PUBLIC RELATIONS 475\nThe format of this\nForimmediaterelease\npiece from Weber\nContact:\nCassieCataline|703.852.5709 Shandwick shows a\nccataline@kettler.com typical news release\nOR\nEricaChlada|410.558.2100 format.
