Regardless of the economy, new media, changes in culture, etc. I don’t accept\nthat these superficial changes in the marketing environment are relevant in terms of\nhow intelligent business practices should be conducted.\nSo what are the immutable principles that guide the practice of marketing commu-\nnication? Advisory Board member Regina Lewis, who has been in charge of consumer\ninsights for InterContinental Hotel Group and Dunkin’Brands, says:\nI believe firmly that even—especially!—in a downturn, the basics of branding by con-\nnecting with consumer values lie at the heart of success. During tough economic times,\nuniquely positioning your brand (a strategy based on knowing how consumers think\nand feel about your brand versus competitive brands) is essential. And communicating\nabout your brand in a way that is highly meaningful to consumers becomes more im-\nportant. This is my philosophy.\nViewpoints of Bill Weintraub, retired Coors chief marketing officer, and Regina Lewis, vice\npresident of Global Consumer Insights for the InterContinental Hotel Group\n2\nChapter 1 • The New World of Marketing Communication\nChapter 2 • Integrated Brand Communication\nChapter 3 • Brand Communication and Society\nWe agree with Weintraub and Lewis that branding, positioning, and communication are the\nfoundations of brand success. We’ve elaborated on their thoughts to compile seven principles that\nwe believe express marketing and marketing communication basics—even in economic down-\nturns. These principles are central themes in this textbook:\n1. BrandBuild and maintain distinctive brands that your customers love.\n2. PositionIdentify your competitive advantage in the minds of consumers.\n3. ConsumeFocus on consumers and match your brand’s strengths to consumer needs\nand wants.\n4. MessageIdentify your best prospects and engage them in a brand conversation.\n5. MediaKnow how to best reach and connect with your target audience.\n6. IntegrateKnow how to connect the dots and make everything in the marketing com-\nmunication toolkit work together.\n7. EvaluateTrack everything you do so you know what works.\nAs you will see in this book, effective advertising and marketing communication are\nfounded on basic, enduring principles. The principles and practices described in this book pro-\nvide direction even when the economy crashes. That doesn’t mean that brand communication is\nunchanging. In fact, the practices are dynamic and continually adapting to changing marketplace\nconditions. But the basic principles are unchanging even in times of change.\nIn the chapters that follow, these principles and practices will be explained, as will the key\npractices of advertising and marketing communication. In Part 1, the first two chapters focus on\ndefining advertising and marketing and explaining where marketing communication fits. Chapter 3\nanalyzes the ethics and social responsibility of marketing and communication.\n3\n1\nThe New World\nof Marketing\nCommunication\nIt’s a Winner\nCampaign: Company: Agency: Award:\n“Whopper Burger King Crispin Porter (cid:2) Grand Effie and\nFreakout” Bogusky Gold Effie in\nRestaurants category\nR\nE\nT\nP\nA\nH\nC\n4\nCHAPTER KEY POINTS\n1. What is advertising,how has it evolved,and what does it do in modern times?\n2. How have the key concepts of marketing communication developed over time?\n3. How is the industry organized—key players,types of agencies,and jobs within agencies?\n4. How is the practice of advertising changing?\nIngredients for a Burger Freakout\nImagine the reaction store managers would receive if they announced to their\ncustomers, “Today this Burger King is a Whopper-free zone.” No more Whop-\npers. That’s precisely what happened in a Las Vegas Burger King. The an-\nnouncement was part of a social experiment designed to see how consumers\nwould react if they couldn’t get their beloved burgers. In the process it showed the\npower of advertising to be relevant and effective in confirming that the Whopper\nis “America’s favorite burger,” and it increased sales. Here’s the inside scoop.\nAd agency Crispin Porter (cid:2) Bogusky (CPB) faced this challenge: the Crispin\nteam had to “take a product that has been around for 50 years and sells more than\na billion units annually and make it interesting enough that the campaign would in-\ncrease sales during a highly competitive period.” And they had to do it using no\nmarketing tools other than advertising. Adding to the challenge, CPB had to ac-\ncomplish this in a competitive environment: McDonald’s consistently outspends\nBurger King three to one.\nThe solution: CPB knew that America loves the Whopper. The agency figured\nit wasn’t enough to just announce that BK’s burger is the best. Who would care?\nInstead of telling facts about the product, the agency figured it had to demonstrate\nthat it was the best burger in a compelling manner. Here’s your first advertising les-\nson:To convince consumers, show them the truth about the product—don’t just\ntell them about it—and do it memorably.\nJust who eats Whoppers? Burger King knows its core demographic (its biggest\ngroup of consumers) is 18- to24-year-old males, and it sure knows how to connect\nwith those dudes.
