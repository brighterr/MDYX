Typ-\nically, marketers align themselves with partners\nthat provide numerous complementary elements, including common target audiences, purchase\ncycle patterns, distribution channels, retailer penetration, and demographics to drive their prod-\nucts and promotions through retail channels and into the minds of consumers.\nAn interesting, although questionable, promotion was Bud Light’s use of “Fan Cans” in col-\nlege colors. It raised questions about licensing and rogue “tie-in” strategies that aren’t sanctioned\nby the schools. In the fall of 2009, Anheuser-Busch had a great idea to tie in with the start of col-\nlege football season by issuing Bud Light in cans with collegiate colors, some 27 different color\ncombinations to be exact. “Show your true colors with Bud Light” the promotional materials an-\nnounced. Retailers reported that Bud Light’s “Fan Can” promotion seemed to be a hit among foot-\nball fans in those cities where wholesalers choose to participate.19\nSeveral problems surfaced with this promotion. Some universities complained that the col-\nored cans infringed on the schools’trademark licensing. Anheuser-Busch agreed not to offer the\npromotion in areas where the schools protested. Others complained that it promoted drinking\namong students, many of whom were underage. AFederal Trade Commission senior attorney,\nJanet Evans, followed up on that complaint expressing “grave concern” about its impact on un-\nderage drinking.\nThe company responded that it takes the problem of underage drinking very seriously.\nAnheuser-Busch’s vice president of corporate social responsibility explained that these cans were\nonly being made available in communities where purchasers must be age 21 or older to drink.\nAnheuser-Busch stood by its rights to sell Bud Light using colors associated with universities—\nand to sell these cans to college fans. Furthermore, there are lots of fans who are not underage and\nthink the game-day promotion is cool.\nPROMOTION STRATEGY\nAsweexplainedinChapter2,promotionsarejustoneelementofthemarketingcommunication\nmixavailabletomarketers.Herewediscussthestrategybehindtheuseofpromotions,aswell\nashowadvertisingandpromotionscomplementeachother,particularlyinbuildingbrands.\nPromotion Objectives\nOur earlier discussion of the use of promotion identified a number of reasons for using promo-\ntions, and these can easily be translated into objectives.
