Häagen-Dazs kicked off its multifaceted efforts to help solve the\nhoneybee mystery by giving substantial research grants to Penn State and UC\nJef I. Richards, University of Texas, and Joseph E. Phelps, University of Alabama, contributed to the review of this\nchapter.\n63\n64 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nDavis scientists. An expert advisory “Bee Board,” comprised of scientists and bee-\nkeepers, served as sources for news media. Häagen-Dazs created advertorials, ad-\nvertising that looks like editorial matter in newspapers or magazines, about the bee\nproblem, which ran in key magazines, such as National GeographicandGourmet.\nHäagen-Dazs even created a new flavor, Vanilla Honey Bee, and earmarked the\nprofits for CCD research.\nOther components of the program spread the message to its audience. The\nwww.helpthehoneybees.comsite educated consumers about the crisis and invited\ntheir involvement. The online presence allowed consumers to purchase T-shirts and\neven send “bee-mail” to friends. Häagen-Dazs funded a six-minute documentary\nabout CCD that is available on the Serious Eats website (www.seriouseats.com). A\n“Bee Dance” video was launched on YouTube. Häagen-Dazs encouraged con-\nsumer involvement by distributing more than a million free bee-friendly seeds in\nHD loves HB packets.\nHäagen-Dazs counted on the people who heard its message to spread the\nword. For example, a reader who happened to be an employee of Whole Foods\nread the National Geographicpiece and inspired Northern California Whole Foods\nstores to create honeybee displays featuring Häagen-Dazs and CCD.\nAlthough the bee problem was the center of the communication, selling a\nbrand was still important. Häagen-Dazs hopes that when you crave premium ice\ncream, you’ll choose its Vanilla Honey Bee or Dulce de Leche over Ben & Jerry’s\nCherry Garcia or Phish Food flavors, partly because it’s a brand that cares.\nWas this effort to be socially responsible successful? In what ways? Turn to the\nend of the chapter to see how Häagen-Dazs measured the effectiveness of these\nefforts.\nSources:“Häagen-Dazs Loves Honey Bees,” Effie Awards Brief of Effectiveness, www.nyama.org;www.helpthehoneybees\n.com;Michael Bush, “Häagen-Dazs Saves the Honeybees,” May 8, 2009, http://adage.com;Gavin O’Malley, “Viewers\nSwarm to Häagen-Dazs Bee-Friendly Viral Video,” August 21, 2008, www.mediapost.com;Juliana Barbassa, “Food Com-\npanies Target Honey Bee Health Problems,” December 1, 2008, www.nytimes.com;“Häagen-Dazs Brand Boosts Image\nand Sales with ‘Häagen-Dazs Loves Honey Bees’ Campaign,” www.ketchum.com;“Häagen-Dazs: Honey, Let’s Lick the\nProblem,” June 2009, www.advertolog.com.\nCaring for the environment and promoting a product can be mutually beneficial, as the “Häagen-\nDazs Loves Honey Bees” case demonstrates. By raising public awareness about the plight of the\nhoneybees, Häagen-Dazs also benefited its ice cream business. This chapter reminds us that as\ncommunicators we make choices. We have the power to use our talents to leave the world a bit\nbetter than we found it. This chapter helps you explore the impact of brand communication on so-\nciety. We present ongoing debates about the power of advertising, look at issues related to social\nresponsibility, and contemplate emerging issues related to digital media. You will examine your\npersonal and professional ethics related to brand communication. Finally, you will read about the\nlegal aspects of advertising and regulatory processes that are in place to make sure harmful com-\nmunication is minimized.\nWHAT IS THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF BRAND COMMUNICATION?\nHäagen-Dazs’s campaign to align itself with a good cause demonstrates that marketing commu-\nnication might help make the world a little better. The Häagen-Dazs case shows that marketers\ncan think beyond the campaign’s immediate benefits to consider how their actions might affect a\nlarger sphere—society and the natural environment. Donating a fortune to help the unfortunate,\nas Bill and Melinda Gates of Microsoft fame have done, is another way for companies to prove\ntheir worth. Think about all of the companies such as Nestlé, Coca-Cola, AT&T, Target, and Wal-\nmart who pitched in to help victims of the Haiti earthquake.\nCHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY 65\n“Avon Commits $1 Million to Support Relief Efforts” in earthquake-\nravaged Haiti. “Coca-Cola Commits to Climate Friendly Refrigeration.”\n“Kraft Foods Employees Honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s Legacy\nAcross the Country.” These headlines1 demonstrate that professional\nbrand communicators have the potential to do good, although too many\nexamples show that communicators sometimes fail to act responsibly.\nAdvertisingandotherformsofmarketingcommunicationareusedef-\nfectivelyforsocialmarketing,aswellasforsellingstuff,whichalsocanbe\nagoodthing.Advertisingcanbeusedtocounterbadbehaviorsandpromote\ngood behavior.
