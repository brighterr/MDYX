Part of that deal was to limit or control the shows available online in order protect ca-\nble subscriptions.51\n• Xbox game players can access Twitter and Facebook from the game’s console making it\npossible for players to tweet their progress, share notes, and compete in real time.

It doesn’t have memory or run Windows, but instead\naccesses websites that provide those services.53\nTagging, Hashtags, and Tag Clouds Search marketing is driven by keywords—the concept or\nthing that you are searching for. In many of the social marketing formats, the posts are catego-\nrized by tags. Similar to keywords, users of Twitter have created tagging, a way to track key-\nwords by inserting a hash symbol (#) before a word in a Tweet. In effect, you have “tagged” that\nword and it becomes a category. Your note, as well as others with the same hashtag,will show\n412 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nup as posts on www.hashtags.org.People tweeting about a\nbrand or company will tag their post with a # symbol plus\nthe company name. Others can follow the tag to see related\nmentions about the brand or company.\nBeyond Twitter mentions, tag cloudsare visual repre-\nsentations of the use of keywords in searches and tags in so-\ncial networking. A tag cloud creates a collage of words\nassociated with a certain phrase or name. The frequency of\nuse determines the weight or size of the associated word in\nthe network (or cloud) of associations. Originally popular-\nized by the photo-sharing site Flickr, tag clouds were created\nfrom search keywords to help users find photos and videos\nthat had something in common. Tag clouds have been useful\nin search engine optimization for Web pages. Hashtags and\ntag clouds have been used by brands and their planners to an-\nalyze the network of brand associations referenced on other\nsites and messages. They give you a quick view of the most\ntalked about topics. For example, study the tag cloud for the\nPhelps Group (www.thephelpsgroup.com), an IMC agency\nin Santa Monica, California.\nUsing the Internet across Borders Because the Internet has\na global reach,it offers real strength to global marketers.

First, not everyone around the globe has the access or\nSource:http://blog.thephelpsgroup.com/blogs/thephelpsgroup/default.aspx. ability to use the Internet via a computer, but the number of\nInternet users is growing exponentially. The Internet audi-\nence is growing faster internationally than it is in the United States, particularly in developing\ncountries such as China and India.\nAdvertising and sales promotion laws differ from country to country. Differences in privacy\nlaws between Europe and the United States are expected to force American companies to change\nthe way they collect and share the consumer information they monitor and retrieve from cus-\ntomers’ Web behavior. Web censoring is also a problem in certain countries with controlled\neconomies, such as China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam. State\ncontrol of the Internet leads to filtering of political information and suppression of criticism, as\nwell as limitations on marketing communication practices.54Even marketing efforts can be cen-\nsored if they are judged to be undermining the local culture or religious standards.\nLanguage is another factor. Although English is the dominant language on the Internet, some\nadvertisers who want to provide different websites for different countries have trouble ensuring\nconsistency across all sites. Another issue is exchange rates. Companies must decide whether to\noffer prices in their own currency or in the local currency.
