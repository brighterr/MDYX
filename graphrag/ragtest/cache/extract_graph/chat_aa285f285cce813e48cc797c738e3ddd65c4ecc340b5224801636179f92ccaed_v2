It might\nhelp to understand two basic research criteria, validity and reliability, that are derived from what\nresearchers call the “scientific method.” Validitymeans that the research actually measures what\nit says it measures. Any differences that are uncovered by the research, such as different attitudes\nor purchasing patterns, really reflect differences among individuals, groups, or situations.\nReliabilitymeans that you can run the same test again and get the same answer.\nQuantitative researchers, particularly those doing experiments and surveys, are concerned\nabout being faithful to the principles of science. Selecting a sample that truly represents the\npopulation, for example, increases the reliability of the research. Poorly worded questions and\ntalking to the wrong people can hurt the validity of surveys, as well as focus groups. The prob-\nlem with experiments is twofold: (1) experiments are limited by a small number of people in the\nexperimental group, and (2) they are conducted under artificial conditions.\nThe information you get from surveys of a broad cross section of a population is limited to\nyour ability to develop good clear questions that everyone can understand and answer. This tight\ncontrol makes it harder to ask questions around the edges of a topic or elicit unexpected or un-\nusual responses. On the other hand, focus groups and in-depth interviews that permit probing are\nlimited by small numbers and possible problems with the representativeness of the sample.\nGenerally, quantitative methods are more useful for gathering data (how many do this or\nbelieve that?), and qualitative methods are better at uncovering reasons and motives (why do\nthey do or believe?). For these reasons, most researchers use a variety of research methods—\nquantitative and qualitative and occasionally experimental designs. Which method should you\nchoose when you conduct research? The answer depends on what questions you need to answer.\n184 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nRESEARCH TRENDS AND CHALLENGES\nMarketing communication researchers face a number of challenges: globalizationand new me-\ndia technology are reshaping the industry. Practices are also changing as the industry searches for\nways to more naturally embed research as feedback, as well as gain more insightful analysis and\nmove into IMC planning. Let’s examine each challenge briefly.\nGlobal Issues\nThe key issues that global researchers face include how to manage and communicate global\nbrandsinwidelydifferentlocalitiesandhowtoshiftfromstudyingdifferencestofindingsimi-\nlaritiesaroundtheworld.Thebiggestproblemiscross-culturalcommunicationandhowtoarrive\natanintendedmessagewithoutculturaldistortionsorinsensitivities.Researchersarebecoming\nmoreinvolvedinpuzzlingoutculturalmeaningsandtestingmarketingcommunicationmessages\nforculturalsensitivityindifferentcountries.Theystruggletodeterminehowothercultureswill\ninterprettheelementsofacampaignsothattheyconveythesamebrandmessageacrosscultures.\nCulturaldifferencescomplicateplanningasaccountplannerSusanMendelsohn,whoisamem-\nberofthisbook’sAdvisoryBoard,discoveredinplanningforanewanalgesicthatcontainedcaf-\nfeine.Intestmarketstheagencydiscoveredthatperceptionsaboutcaffeinevarypositivelyand\nnegativelyindifferentcultures.\nIMC Research Challenges\nThe deluge of data is only complicated by IMC planning, which requires research into many\nstakeholder groups and contact points. Instead of campaign planning where messages are\ntweaked slightly to fit different media, strategic consistencyin IMC planning suggests that dif-\nferent audiences, as well as media, need different messages. Susan Mendelsohn calls this a more\nradical trend in planning research and points to “companies that are experimenting with multi-\nmessage strategies that fit each vehicle uniquely and yet might be radically different from each\nother.” She cautions that the company needs to be clear about the goals for its brand, recognizing\nthat there might be multiple goals—a set of integrated goals—rather than one big underlying goal\nand that suggests multiple measurements of effectiveness, as well.\nPlanning for Feedback\nLearning how to better listen to consumers has become an important factor in effective market-\ning communication. Earlier we mentioned the use of customer contact to elicit feedback; there\nare also ways to structure feedback into message strategies. In embedded feedback research,the\nresearch method is built into the response, including the contact point, purchase activity, and use\nsituations. Campaigns that encourage interested prospects to contact a company, for example, are\nsetting up response monitoring as part of the message strategy. Call centers, both inbound (cus-\ntomer calls to complain or get assistance) and outbound (telemarketing), can also be used as re-\nsearch centers to gain real-time feedback about the brand and its marketing and advertising\nstrategies. In other words, whenever a call is made, for whatever purpose, that contact provides\nan opportunity to ask a brand-related question. Marketers also monitor blogs, chat rooms, and so-\ncial media (Facebook, MySpace, Twitter) for clues about what people are saying about a brand.\nAn example of a structured feedback program\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
