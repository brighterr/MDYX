Company web-\nsites allow business clients to view product lists, place orders, check prices and availabil-\nity, and replace inventories automatically. The Internet is also a primary research tool used\nby B2B marketers to check out competitors and to find areas of new business and suppli-\ners. One of the most popular B2B sites on the Internet is the FedEx site, which allows\nclients to track packages, obtain price information, and learn about FedEx software and\nservices. It receives 1.7 million tracking requests a month, 40 percent of which probably\nwould have been called in to the company’s 800 number if the website were not available.\nBecause handling each call costs approximately $1, its website saves FedEx more than $8\nmillion a year.\n• B2B Direct MarketingDirect mail has the capacity to sell a B2B brand, provide sales leads,\nand lay the groundwork for subsequent sales calls. Business advertisers use print and online\ncatalogs and product literature to reach their target markets, which support the selling func-\ntion by providing technical data about the product and supplementary information concern-\ning price, availability, delivery, and warranties. Direct marketing is widely used because\nmost target audiences are smaller than the audiences for many consumer brands; therefore,\nB2B marketers can target their messages (because they know names and addresses) and\ngreatly minimize media waste.\nCustomer service and technical support departments are important in many different busi-\nness categories, but particularly in B2B. Calling a customer help line frequently gets you a mes-\nsage about wait time, a robotic recording, an impenetrable non-U.S. accent, or a cheerfully inept\nlive person. The message: “Your call is (not that) important to us,” which is also the title of a book\ncritical of customer service industry practices.14One solution to the customer service problem in\ncomputer technical support is to enlist volunteers who are “super-users.” So you think no one\nwould work for a company for free, right? That’s exactly how a corps of Web-savvy people cre-\nated the open-source Linux operating system. Verizon and other companies have found that there\nCHAPTER 18 • THE IMC UMBRELLA 559\nare groups of experts who find social (and intellectual) rewards in solving problems and, in some\ncases, contributing to product development and improvement.15\nSocial media have become important to B2B marketers because they offer personal contact,\nwhich is ideal for tightly targeted programs. An IBM social media manager has some ideas for\nB2B marketers on how to use Twitter for segmenting prospects in terms of the desired response.\nHer point is that within businesses, you may want to contact people in different parts of the or-\nganization with specific messages. Here is a summary of this strategy in terms of public relations\nand promotion activities looking at who to follow and the appropriate objectives for reaching that\ngroup.

Nonprofit\nmarketing is used by organizations such as hospitals, government agencies, zoos, museums, or-\nchestras, religious organizations, charities, and universities and schools to “sell” their services,\nprograms, and ideas.\nMany people make the mistake of thinking that competition only exists between for-profit\ncompanies. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Nonprofits often have to compete as hard, if\nnot more so, than for-profit companies because they know individuals and businesses have just\nso much money and time to donate to nonprofit organizations. It is also a myth to think that non-\nprofits are not businesses. The Red Cross and the Salvation Army, for example, have hundreds of\nfull-time paid staff and multimillion-dollar annual budgets.\nNonprofit organizations have a number of goals, such as membership(AARP, chambers of\ncommerce),donations(Red Cross, United Way, American Cancer Society), participation(Habi-\ntat for Humanity), sales (museum gift shops), recruitment (the military, universities), attitude\nchange (political parties), advocacy (Weyerhauser for forest management), and visits or\nattendance(state tourism programs, art museums).\nAnother goal is action, as the SORPA recycling ads from Iceland demonstrate.
