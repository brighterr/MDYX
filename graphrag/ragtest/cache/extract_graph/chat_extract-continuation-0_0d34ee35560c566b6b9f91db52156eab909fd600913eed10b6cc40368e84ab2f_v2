That has created a huge bottom-line problem for local newspapers.\n• SupplementsNewspapersupplementsare magazine-style publications inserted into a news-\npaper, especially in the Sunday edition, that are either syndicated nationally or prepared\nlocally. Syndicated supplements, such as ParadeandUSA Weekend,are provided by an inde-\npendent publisher that sells its publications to newspapers throughout the country. Afree-\nstanding insert (FSI)is the set of advertisements, such as the grocery ads, that are inserted\ninto the newspaper. These preprinted advertisements range in size from a single page to more\nthan 30 pages and may be in black and white or full color. This material is often printed else-\nwhere and then delivered to the newspaper. Newspapers charge the advertiser a fee for insert-\ning a supplement. FSI advertising is growing in popularity with retail advertisers for three\nreasons: (1) it allows greater control over the reproduction quality of the advertisement, (2) it\ncommands more attention than just another ad in the paper, and (3) advertisers can place FSIs\nin certain newspapers that are delivered to certain neighborhoods, or even certain people.\nNewspaperReadershipMeasurement NearlyhalfofalladultsreceivehomedeliveryofaSunday\norweekdaynewspaper;deliverylevelsarehighestinsmall-andmedium-sizedcitiesandlowestin\nrural locations and larger metropolitan areas.

This type of information\none person. facilitates the media planner’s ability to match a certain newspaper’s readership with the target\naudience. Agencies obtain objective measures of newspaper circulation and readership by sub-\nscribing to one or both of the following auditing companies:\n• The Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC)The ABC is an independent auditing group that rep-\nresents advertisers, agencies, and publishers. This group verifies statements about newspaper\ncirculationand provides a detailed analysis of the newspaper by state, town, and county. ABC\nmembers include only paid-circulation newspapers and magazines.\n• Simmons-ScarboroughSimmons-Scarborough Syndicated Research Associates provides a\nsyndicated study that annually measures readershipprofiles in approximately 70 of the na-\ntion’s largest cities. The study covers readership of a single issue and the estimated undupli-\ncated readers for a series of issues.\nMagazine Basics\nThe more than 6,000 magazines published in the United States appeal to every possible interest.\nMost magazines aim at niche markets with a focus on a particular hobby, sport, age group, busi-\nness category, and profession.

The number-one magazine in terms of circulation is AARP,The\nMagazine,which is sent free to anyone over age 50.\nThe Magazine Publishers Association (MPA) estimates that more than 90 percent of all\nPrinciple\nAmerican adults read at least one magazine per month, and the average reader spends 44 minutes\nPeople spend more time\nwith magazines because reading each issue.

Readers also spend more time reading a magazine than they do reading a newspaper, so there\nis a better opportunity to provide in-depth information.\nQuality of reproduction is one of the biggest strengths of magazines. It allows the advertiser’s\nproducts and brand image to be presented in a format superior to the quality of newspapers. Food\ncompanies especially like the ability to\nmake their products look appetizing.\nHealth of the Magazine Industry The\nmagazine industry hasn’t suffered as\nmuch from the recession and changing\nmedia environment as newspapers\nhave. Although single-copy sales were\ndown at the end of 2009, these sales\nmake up a small slice (2 percent) of\nmagazine circulation.
