In fact, nearly\nhalf of the respondents said they ignored Internet banner ads.2\nThis type of research that asks consumers what they think influences their behavior is best\nused when combined with other consumer behavior findings. Why? Because most consumers\ndon’t really know what influences them. (Just ask some of your friends how much advertising im-\npacts what they buy. Most will probably say that “it doesn’t” or “just a little.”)\nFor the launch of the Audi A3, the McKinley (cid:2) Silver media team knew it needed an in-\ndepth understanding of its target audience of young males to develop a media plan that would\nwork for this difficult-to-reach group. From research they found that young males typically don’t\nread or watch traditional media. They’re busy and skeptical about commercial messages. From\nthese findings the team came up with a profile of the target, which they described as “intelligent,\nindependent, and innovative” and heavy users of new media. This target audience for this prod-\nuct category is made up of opinion leaders who influence their peers. They are not as interested\nin buying an entry-level car as they are in getting “what’s next.”\nStep 2: Communication and Media Objectives\nAlthough creative decisions are sometimes made before media planning, this is changing. With\nthe increasing variety of media options available, smart clients and agencies are having up-front\ncross-functional planning meetings that include creatives, media planners, and account execu-\ntives. The point is that the media and message strategies are interdependent and decisions in one\narea affect decisions in the other.\nMarketing communication objectives, as you will recall, describe what a company wants target\naudiences to think, feel, and most importantly, do. Media objectivesdescribe what a company wants\nto accomplish regarding the delivery of its brand messages and their impact on the target audience.\nThe communication objectives provide guidance to media planners. For example, why\nwould brands want to spend some $3 million to advertise on the Super Bowl unless the buy fits\nwith its brand communication objectives? Pepsi, a long-time Super Bowl advertiser, pulled out in\n2010 deciding that expensive brand reminder ads in front of an audience that already knows the\nbrand don’t make sense. On the other hand, brands that are building their images, launching new\nproducts, or who want to use messages to shape public perceptions on a mass scale—the Super\nBowl reaches some 100 million viewers—might see the investment as a good one. Two advertis-\ners during the 2010 Super Bowl illustrate reasons corporations might want to make the invest-\nment. Hyundai, for example, wants to change its image from a maker of small, cheap cars to a\nupscale image and Career Builder believes its job search services are appropriately communi-\ncated to a broad population as the United States comes out of a recession.3\nAs we mentioned in Chapter 11, the two basic media objectives are reach and frequency.\nLet’s consider how planners create strategies that deliver on those objectives.\nThe Reach Objective The percent of people exposed to a brand message one or more times\nPrinciple\nwithin a specified period of time is called reach.Acampaign’s success is due in part to its abil-\nReach is the first place\nity to reach as many of the targeted audience as possible within a stated budget and time period. to start when setting\nConsequently, many planners feel that reach is the most important objective and that it’s the place objectives for a media\nto start when figuring out a media plan. plan.\nUsing demographic and lifestyle data, planners can focus on reaching specific types of house-\nholds (e.g., empty nesters, homes with two(cid:2)children under age 18, single-parent households, HHs\nwith incomes over $100,000) or individuals (males ages 25 to 49, people who rent). This enables\nplanners to better match media profiles with the characteristics of the campaign’s target audience.\n428 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nBecause most media reach large numbers of people who are not in the target market, how-\never, most marketers are more interested in targeted reach, which is the percentage of a vehicle’s\naudience that matches the brand’s target market. An estimate of targeted reach can be developed\nassuming the brand’s target market can be identified in the vehicle’s audience profile. Targeted\nreach is particularly important to calculate in order to estimate the amount of wasted reach,\nwhich is the number of people in the vehicle’s audience who are neither customers nor prospects.\nWe mentioned this problem in our discussion of network television, which is particularly sus-\nceptible to this criticism because of its mass audience.\nAssessing the media for target audience opportunities is a major challenge for media plan-\nners. The evening news on television, for example, reaches a broad mass-market audience; if your\ntarget is women ages 25 to 49, then you have to consider the targeted reachof that news program.\nObviously both men and women watch news, so you know that your audience would probably be\nhalf or less of that, especially since you are targeting a specific age group. Maybe the evening\nnews isn’t a good option to reach this target because there would be so much waste. Outdoor, as\ntheCourt TVposters illustrate, are a location-bound medium and posters are particularly good at\ntargeting a specified population.\nThe Frequency Objective As we explained in Chapter 11, frequencyrefers to the repetition of\nmessage exposure. You should keep in mind that the frequency number for a media buy is actu-\nally the average number of exposure opportunities of those reached.\nBecause frequency is an average,it can be misleading. The range of frequency is often large:\nSome people see a particular brand message once, while\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUDI A3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Audi A3 is a car model targeted at young males, known for being intelligent, independent, and innovative, and heavy users of new media)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCKINLEY SILVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McKinley Silver is a media team responsible for developing a media plan for the Audi A3 launch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEPSI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pepsi is a long-time Super Bowl advertiser that pulled out in 2010, deciding that expensive brand reminder ads were unnecessary)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYUNDAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hyundai is a car manufacturer aiming to change its image from a maker of small, cheap cars to an upscale image)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAREER BUILDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Career Builder is a job search service that advertised during the 2010 Super Bowl to communicate its services to a broad population)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPER BOWL<|>EVENT<|>The Super Bowl is a major sporting event with a large audience, used by brands to reach a mass audience and shape public perceptions)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUDI A3<|>MCKINLEY SILVER<|>McKinley Silver developed a media plan for the launch of the Audi A3<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEPSI<|>SUPER BOWL<|>Pepsi has historically advertised during the Super Bowl but pulled out in 2010<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYUNDAI<|>SUPER BOWL<|>Hyundai advertised during the 2010 Super Bowl to change its brand image<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAREER BUILDER<|>SUPER BOWL<|>Career Builder advertised during the 2010 Super Bowl to reach a broad audience<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
