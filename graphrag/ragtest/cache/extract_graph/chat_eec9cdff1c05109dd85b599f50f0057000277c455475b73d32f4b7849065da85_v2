Computer\ngraphic artists brag that they can do anything with an image. They can look at any object from\nany angle or even from the inside out. One of the most creative video techniques is called\nmorphing,in which one object gradually changes into another. Photographs of real objects can\nchange into art or animation and then return to life. Computer graphics specialists use computer\nsoftware to create, multiply, and manipulate video images. (That’s how 50 cats can be made to\nlook like hundreds in the EDS “Herding Cats” commercial.)\nFilming and Editing\nMost local retail commercials are simple and inexpensive, and they are typically shot and taped\nat the local station. The sales representative for the station may work with the advertiser to write\nthe script, and the station’s director handles the taping of the commercial.\nCreating a national TVcommercial is more complex and requires a number of people with\nspecialized skills. The ad agency crew usually includes the copywriter, art director, and producer.\nThe producer oversees the production on behalf of the agency and client and is responsible for\nthe budget, among other things. The director, who is the person responsible for filming the com-\nmercial, is usually someone from outside the agency. This person takes the art director’s story-\nboard and makes it come to life on film.\nThe producer and director make up the core of the production team. The commercial’s ef-\nfectiveness depends on their shared vision of the final commercial and the director’s ability to\nbring it to life as the art director imagined it. In the case of the “Cat Herders” commercial, the di-\nrector was chosen by the agency because of his skill at coaxing naturally humorous performances\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
