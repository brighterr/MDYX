Local and consumer activist groups represent\ntwo ways in which self-regulation occurs in this manner:\n• Local GroupAt the local level, self-regulation has been supported by the Better Business\nBureau (BBB). The BBB (www.bbb.org) functions much like the national regulatory agen-\ncies and also provides local businesses with advice concerning the legal aspects of adver-\ntising. Approximately 250 local and national bureaus made up of advertisers, agencies,\nand media, have screened hundreds of thousands of advertisements for possible violations\nof truth and accuracy. Although the BBB has no legal power, it receives and investigates\ncomplaints and maintains files on violators. It also assists local law enforcement officials\nin prosecuting violators. The ease with which the BBB can be accessed on the Internet has\nprompted businesses to be more careful about complying with its standards.\n90 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\n• Consumer Activist GroupConsumer groups of all kinds monitor advertising practices. The\nAction for Children’s Advertising group follows the practices of advertisers who market to\nchildren and will file complaints with industry boards or regulatory agencies about adver-\ntisements they consider questionable. The consumer group Public Citizen inspired the FDA\nto require warnings on print ads for certain types of nicotine products. Groups that are fo-\ncused on media literacy also review the performance of advertisers. For example, the Cul-\ntural Environment Movement is a nonprofit coalition of independent organizations and\nindividuals that focuses on fairness, diversity, and justice in media communication.38\nLooking Ahead\nThis chapter asked you to consider the social responsibility dimensions of advertising and mar-\nketing communication in terms of ethics and regulation. The next section, Part II, will introduce\nyou to the basics of brand communication planning with chapters on how marketing communi-\ncation works, the consumer audience, strategic research, and strategy and planning.\nIT’S A WRAP\nIt’s a Winner, Just\nBee-Cause\nAs noted at the beginning of this chapter, the crisis of the honeybees is bigger than ice cream—it affects\na significant part of the food chain. The work Häagen-Dazs has done to illuminate the problem and work\ntoward a solution demonstrates that profits are only one measure of a brand’s success. Acting socially re-\nsponsible is part of the formula for good business.\nChristine Chen, deputy director of communication strategy at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, said the\ncampaign was successful in part because the honeybee issue was a natural fit with Häagen-Dazs. She said,\nThat [connection] made it more than just some cause we say we care about. It was something that\nprobably came as a surprise to consumers because it was a way they never really thought about the\nbrand before. The idea was to get people to think about the problem first and foremost and then to\nunderstand Häagen-Dazs’s connection to it and become motivated to do something about it.\nAlthough the bee crisis continues, more resources are focused on solving the mystery. Häagen-Dazs along\nwith other bee-involved brands such as Burt’s Bees were invited to testify before the House Agricultural Sub-\ncommittee, and they successfully convinced congressional members to allocate funding for the CCD issue.\nThe investment in the problem paid good dividends for the brand as well. The honeybee buzz had a pos-\nitive impact on sales. Unaided brand awareness of Häagen-Dazs rose from 29 to 36 percent. It generated lots\nof publicity. It made 125 million impressions, which is the number of people who may have seen something\nin the media about the crisis. This number of impressions had been set as the yearlong goal and was achieved\nin quick order—during the campaign’s first week. The viral “Bee Dance” video on YouTube received more\nthan a million hits in the first month, proving once again, the power of the Internet.\n”Häagen-Dazs Loves Honey Bees” won a swarm of awards for this campaign, including a Gold Effie; 2009\nFestival of Media, Media Responsibility Award; Cannes Lions 2009 PR Lion; 2009 PRWeek Award for Cause-\nRelated Campaign of the Year; and the 2009 Silver SABRE (Superior Achievement in Branding and Reputa-\ntion) Award.\nAd lesson learned: Acting socially responsibility is good business.\nCHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
