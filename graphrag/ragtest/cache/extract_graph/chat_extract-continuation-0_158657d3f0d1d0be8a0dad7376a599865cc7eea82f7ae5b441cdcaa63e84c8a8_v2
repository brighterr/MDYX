What are the basic types of strategic research and how are they used?\n2. What are the most common research methods used in advertising?\n3. What are the key challenges facing advertising researchers?\nCheesy Fun. It’s Not Just for Kids.\nWhat do you think of when you think of Cheetos? The crunch and maybe\norange fingers? A product that’s been marketed to kids for its 60-year\nhistory, Cheetos is a brand long-associated with fun.\nBut it wasn’t so funny when competitors Goldfish and Cheez-It started\nspending double the amount that Cheetos did on media.\nThe competitive problem was complicated by some social responsibility is-\nsues. Growing concerns about childhood obesity and the ethical concern of mar-\nketing to kids were serious challenges to Pepsico/Frito Lay, which is Cheetos’\nparent company. A commitment to be socially responsible led Pepsico to vol-\nuntarily sign the Children’s Food & Beverage Advertising Initiative in 2007, which\nrestricted advertising of not-so-healthy foods to children under age 12.\nThe result? Cheetos chose to abandon its position as a favorite kids’ snack\nand target a new audience. That’s a scary new strategy for any brand. It started\nits quest to find a new direction by setting specific objectives to help focus its\nresearch efforts:\n1. Discover if an alternate adult target could be identified for Cheetos.\n2. DevelopabetterunderstandingoftheCheetos’consumptionexperience.\n3. Understand the overlaps between kids and the new adult target so that ex-\nisting brand equities could be carried forward.\n4. Develop and evaluate compelling new message strategies for the new target\naudience.\nFindings from this research might surprise you. Even though Cheetos had\nbeen marketed as a children’s snack, adults ate them too. Several studies re-\nvealed fascinating insights that eventually led to a new campaign for adults.\nOne study investigated attitudes of adults and children (ages 10 to 13) who\nclaimed to be Cheetos brand lovers. Interestingly, both the adults and the kids\ncommunicated feelings of stress. A key insight from the research revealed that\nthe playfulness associated with Cheetos could help these consumers escape\nsome of their daily pressures.\n161\n162 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nResearchers also listened to what Cheetos fans said about the experience of\neating Cheetos and watched how they acted when they ate Cheetos. Group mem-\nbers loved eating them and licking their fingers as if to say they were looking for\npermissionnotto act their age or conform to expected adult behavior.\nCheetos spokes-animal Chester Cheetah related well to kids. But would he ap-\npeal to adults? To test this idea, someone dressed up in a Chester Cheetah cos-\ntume and walked the hot spots in San Francisco. Grown adults embraced the\nmascot by hugging and posing for pictures with him, proving this icon was up to\nthe job no matter what the age of the Cheetos’ fan.\nAnother study asked 1,000 adults about their attitudes to play. The respon-\ndents answered questions about when they played hooky from work and when\nthey last skinny dipped and so on. Findings from this survey were telling. About half\nof those labeled “very playful” were most likely to eat a lot of Cheetos, and the\n“least playful” were also least likely to consume the product.\nFrom literature on cultural trends, the agency was able to define an emerging\ngroup of people who were likely to be passionate for Cheetos. A book by Christo-\npher Noxon1 identified a new breed of adults called “rejuveniles.” These are the\nfolks who think playing isn\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>THE CENTURY COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Century Council is a nonprofit organization focused on combating underage drinking and promoting responsible decision-making regarding alcohol consumption)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEPSICO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pepsico is a multinational food and beverage corporation, and the parent company of Frito-Lay, which owns the Cheetos brand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRITO-LAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Frito-Lay is a division of Pepsico that produces snack foods, including the Cheetos brand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEETOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cheetos is a snack food brand owned by Frito-Lay, known for its cheesy flavor and orange color, traditionally marketed to children but now targeting adults)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHESTER CHEETAH<|>PERSON<|>Chester Cheetah is the mascot for the Cheetos brand, known for his playful and mischievous personality)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOODBY, SILVERSTEIN & PARTNERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Goodby, Silverstein & Partners is an advertising agency that developed the \"Mischievous Fun with Cheetos®\" campaign)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTOPHER NOXON<|>PERSON<|>Christopher Noxon is an author who wrote about \"rejuveniles,\" adults who embrace playfulness and childlike behavior)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEPSICO<|>FRITO-LAY<|>Frito-Lay is a division of Pepsico responsible for producing Cheetos<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRITO-LAY<|>CHEETOS<|>Frito-Lay owns the Cheetos brand<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHESTER CHEETAH<|>CHEETOS<|>Chester Cheetah is the mascot for the Cheetos brand<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOODBY, SILVERSTEIN & PARTNERS<|>CHEETOS<|>Goodby, Silverstein & Partners developed an advertising campaign for Cheetos<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRISTOPHER NOXON<|>CHEETOS<|>Christopher Noxon's concept of \"rejuveniles\" aligns with Cheetos' new target audience<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
