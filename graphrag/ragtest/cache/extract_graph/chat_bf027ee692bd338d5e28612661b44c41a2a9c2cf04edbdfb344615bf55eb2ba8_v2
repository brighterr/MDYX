The\nconsumer can respond by telephone, mail, or over the Internet, and the product is delivered\ndirectly to the consumer by mail or some other carrier.\n4. Business-to-business (B2B) advertising,also called trade advertising,is sent from one\nbusiness to another. It includes messages directed at companies distributing products as\nwell as industrial purchasers and professionals such as lawyers and physicians. Advertisers\nplace most business advertising in professional publications.\n5. Institutional advertising,also called corporate advertising,focuses on establishing a cor-\nporate identity or winning the public over to the organization’s point of view. Tobacco\ncompanies, for example, run ads that focus on the positive things they are doing. The ads\nfor a pharmaceutical company showcasing leukemia treatment also adopt that focus.\n6. Nonprofit advertisingis used by not-for-profit organizations, such as charities, founda-\ntions, associations, hospitals, orchestras, museums, and religious institutions, to reach cus-\ntomers (hospitals, for example), members (the Sierra Club), and volunteers (Red Cross). It\nis also used to solicit donations and other forms of program participation. The “Truth”®\ncampaign for the American Legacy Foundation, which tries to reach teenagers with anti-\nsmoking messages, is an example of nonprofit advertising.\n7. Public service advertisingprovides messages on behalf of a good cause, such as stopping\ndrunk driving (as in ads from Mothers Against Drunk Driving) or preventing child abuse. Also\ncalledpublic service announcements (PSAs),advertising and public relations professionals\nusually create them pro bono(free of charge) and the media donate the space and time.\n12 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nRetailers sometimes advertise nationally, but much of their advertising is targeted to a\nspecific market, such as this direct-mail piece for T.

In practice, all types of advertising demand creative, original messages that\nare strategically sound and well executed, and all of them are delivered through some form of me-\ndia. Furthermore, advertisements can be developed as single ads largely unrelated to other ads by\nthe same advertiser or as a campaign,a term that refers to a set of related ads that are variations\nCHAPTER 1 • THE NEW WORLD OF MARKETING COMMUNICATION 13\non a theme. They are used in different media at different\ntimes for different segments of the audience and to keep\nattracting the attention of the target audience. Let’s now\nconsider the development of key advertising concepts and\npractices.\nHOW DID CURRENT PRACTICES\nAND CONCEPTS DEVELOP?\nAs illustrated in the timeline in Figure 1.1the advertising\nindustry is dynamic and is affected by changes in technol-\nogy, media, and the economic and social environment. But\nthis history is far more than names and dates. The timeline\nreflects how the principles and practices of a multibillion-\ndollar industry have evolved.3\nEras and Ages\nThe timeline divides the evolution of advertising into five\nstages, which reflect historical eras and the changes that\nlead to different philosophies and styles of advertising. As\nyou read through this, note how changing environments, in\nparticular media advancements, have changed the way ad-\nvertising functions.
