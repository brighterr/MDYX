Asmaller agency will combine some\nof these levels. Of course, individual agencies also have their own titles for these positions, such\nas the “content manager” title used at CPB.\nAccount Planning and Research Full-service agencies usually have a separate department\nspecifically devoted to planning and sometimes to research as well. Today the emphasis in agency\nresearch is on developing an advertising message concept that focuses on the consumer’s per-\nspective and relationship with the brand. The account planninggroup gathers all available in-\ntelligence on the market and consumers and acts as the voice of the consumer. Account planners\nare strategic specialists who prepare comprehensive information about consumers’wants, needs,\nand relationship to the client’s brand and recommendations on how the advertising should work\nto satisfy those elements based on insights they derive from consumer research.\nCreative Development and Production A creative group includes people who write\n(copywriters), people who design ideas for print ads or television commercials (art directors), and\npeople who convert these ideas into television or radio commercials (producers). Many agencies\nbuild a support group around a team of an art director and copywriter who work well together. In\naddition to these positions, the broadcast production department and art studio are two other ar-\neas where creative personnel can apply their skills.\nMedia Research, Planning, and Buying Agencies that don’t rely on outside media specialists\nhave a media department that recommends to the client the most efficient means of delivering\nthe message to the target audience. That department has three functions: research, planning, and\nbuying. Because the media world is so complex, it is not unusual for some individuals to become\nexperts in certain markets or types of media.\nInternal Operations The departments that serve the operations within the agency include the\ntraffic department and print production, as well as the more general financial services and human\nresources (personnel) departments. The traffic department is the lifeblood of the agency, and its\npersonnel keep track of everything that happens.\nHow Are Agencies Paid?\nAdvertising agencies are a big business. Procter & Gamble, for example, spends nearly $5 billion\nannually on global advertising. With that kind of money on the table, you can imagine that the\nagency–client relationship is under pressure from both sides. Agencies want to get more work and\nget paid more; clients want to cut costs and make their advertising as cost effective as possible.\nAgencies derive their revenues and profits from three main sources: commissions, fees,and\nretainers. For years, a 15 percent commissionon media billings was the traditional form of com-\npensation. That’s actually how agencies got started back in the 19th century. For those few ac-\ncounts still using a commission approach, the rate is rarely 15 percent; it is more likely lower and\nsubject to negotiation between agency and client.\nMany advertisers now use a fee system either as the primary compensation tool or in com-\nbination with a commission system. The fee system is comparable to the system by which ad-\nvertisers pay their lawyers and accountants. The client and agency agree on an hourly fee or rate\nor may negotiate a charge for a specific project. This fee can vary by department, or it may be a\nflat hourly fee for all work regardless of the salary level of the person doing the work. Charges\nare also included for out-of-pocket expenses, travel, and other standard items.\nAn agency also may be put on a monthly or yearly retainer.The amount billed per month is\nbased on the projected amount of work and the hourly rate charged. This system is most com-\nmonly used by public relations agencies.\nAmore recent trend in agency compensation is for advertisers to pay agencies on the basis of\ntheir performance. One consultant recommends that this arrangement be based on paying the agency\neither a percentage of the client’s sales or a percentage of the client’s marketing budget. Procter &\nGamble is a pioneer in trying to apply this system. Another version of this idea is that agencies share\nin the profits of their client when they create a successful campaign, but that also means they have\na greater financial risk in the relationship should the advertising not create the intended impact.\nAnother innovation in agency compensation is called value billing, which means that the\nagency is paid for its creative and strategic ideas, rather than for executions and media placements.\n26 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nSarah Armstrong, Coke’s director of worldwide media and communication, has urged the indus-\ntry to shift to “value-based” forms of compensation that reward agencies based on effectiveness—\nwhether they make the objectives they set for their advertising.6\nHOW IS THE PRACTICE OF ADVERTISING CHANGING?\nWewouldliketoendthisreviewofadvertisingbasicsbytalkingaboutthefutureofadvertising.\nBecauseoftherecentGreatRecession,MikeCarlton,anindustrycommentator,says,“[C]learly\nweareatapointintimewhenthingswillneverbequitethesameagainforourindustry.”Butthere\narestillsomeexcitingchangesthatopenupopportunitiesfornewprofessionalsenteringthefield.\nConsumer in Charge\nAs Jim Stengel, Procter & Gamble’s former global marketing officer, has said, “[I]t’s not just\nabout\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
