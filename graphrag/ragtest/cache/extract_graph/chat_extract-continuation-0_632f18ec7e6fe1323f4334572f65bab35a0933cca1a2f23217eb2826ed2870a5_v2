Canada uses ads on\nYouTube titled “Waking Up Canadian” to explain the situation.15\n(Check them out at www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDeDQpIQFD0)\nOgilvy’s views and most of the traditional models, however, leave\nout a very critical factor that helps explain how advertising works and\nthat is emotion,which Nyilasy and Reid’s practitioners believe is just\nas important as information in the formation of attitudes. Some experts\neven believe emotion is more important than logical thinking in con-\nsumer decision making.\nOgilvy also recognizes persuasion as an important function and\nNyilasy and Reid’s professionals point to attitudes as critical—attitude\nformation and change being an important result of persuasive communi-\ncation. (For other quotes and insights into how advertising works—or\nshould work—visit www.advertisinghalloffame .org/members.)\nThe traditional approaches to defining the effects of advertising\npose two problems: (1) the presumption of a set of steps as a\npredictable pattern of response—as in the old hierarchy of effects\nmodels—and (2) missing effects. The problem with the step-based (hi-\nerarchical and linear) models is that advertisers now realize people\ndon’t always respond in such a predictable fashion. This was confirmed\nby the opinions of the practitioners interviewed by Nyilasy and Reid\nwho insist that “effects beyond getting attention can occur in any order,\nor even simultaneously.”16\nOgilvy’s focus on persuasion illustrates the problem that effects\nmodels don’t always cover the essential facets of marketing communica-\ntion impact. This problem is also particularly apparent when we look at\nresearch techniques used to evaluate effectiveness. Consider, for exam-\nple, that the model of television advertising the Ameritest research company (www.Ameritest.net) An unsuspecting but\nnewly recognized\ndeveloped to test commercials is based on three factors—attention, brand linkage, and motivation—\nCanadian citizen wakes\nand two of these—brand linkage and motivation—aren’t mentioned in the traditional formulas we\nup to find his bedroom\njust discussed.17How can a major company that specializes in measuring effectiveness use an ap-\nhas become a center of\nproach that is so different from the models professionals use in planning the advertising? As Chuck\nCanadian symbols.\nYoung, the founder of Ameritest, emphasizes, “In all acts of perception and communication, emo-\ntion comes first, and thought comes second.”18\nAnotherimportantareamissingfromthetraditionalmodels,butnotfromtheAmeritestap-\nproach,isbrandcommunication.Asanindicationofitsimportancetotheprofessionalcommunity,\nconsiderthatOgilvy&Mather(O&M)makesbrandcommunicationthefoundationoftheagency’s\n360°BrandStewardshipphilosophy.Onitswebsite(www.Ogilvy.com),theagencysays,“Webe-\nlieveourjobistohelpclientsbuildenduringbrandsthatliveaspartofconsumers’livesandcom-\nmandtheirloyaltyandconfidence.”Toaccomplishthataim,O&Mdescribesitsroleas:19\nCreating attention-getting messages that make a promise consistent and true to the brand’s\nimage and identity. And guiding actions,both big and small,that deliver on that brand\npromise. To every audience that brand has. At every brand intersection point. At all times.\nWHAT ARE THE FACETS OF IMPACT?\nOur objective in this chapter is to present our Facets Model of Effects that does a more complete\njob than previous models of explaining how advertising creates impact in terms of various types\nof consumer responses. Ultimately, we are guided by the kind of thinking that Regina Lewis\n106 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nexpressed in the Part 2 opener: that consumers are loyal to brands that say something about them\nas human beings. Effective marketing communication speaks to us about things that we want to\nknow in ways that we like.\nThe simplicity of think/feel/do makes it a good starting point, since all three of these effects\nare generally recognized as critical consumer responses to advertising. Several of the models be-\ngin with terms like attention, awareness, and exposure, concepts that recognize there is a\nperceptual dimension to advertising impact, as Moriarty’s domains model suggests. Another\nmissing area we’ve noted is persuasion,which explains how beliefs and attitudes are created or\nchanged and conviction is established. Since persuasion relies on both think and feel responses,\nit doesn’t fit at all in the hierarchical models and falls between the cracks if you are trying to use\nthe think/feel/do approach as a model for objectives. Another of the areas missing from most\nmodels is association, which Preston and Thorson use to explain how brand communication\nworks in general.20In recognition of its importance to brand communication, this category is also\ncalledbrand transformationorbrand linkage.\nThe solution, then, to our search for a new model is to build on the effects identified in the\nthink/feel/do approach and add the missing categories. It is interesting that the missing areas we\njust identified—perception, brand association, and persuasion—are also related to the three areas\nthat the Ameritest research company uses in evaluating effective commercials.\nThus, we propose a six-factor model that should be useful both in setting objectives and eval-\nuating the effectiveness of advertising. Our answer to the question of how advertising works is to\npropose that effective advertising creates six types of consumer responses: (1) see/hear, (2) feel,\n(3) think/under\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CANADA<|>GEO<|>Canada is a country that is restoring citizenship to foreigners who were forced to renounce it, including many Americans)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OGILVY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ogilvy is an advertising agency that focuses on persuasion and brand communication as part of its 360° Brand Stewardship philosophy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NYILASY AND REID<|>PERSON<|>Nyilasy and Reid are practitioners who emphasize the importance of emotion in advertising and consumer decision-making)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERITEST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ameritest is a research company that evaluates the effectiveness of television advertising based on attention, brand linkage, and motivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHUCK YOUNG<|>PERSON<|>Chuck Young is the founder of Ameritest, emphasizing the role of emotion in perception and communication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OGILVY & MATHER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ogilvy & Mather is an advertising agency that prioritizes brand communication and consumer loyalty)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OGILVY<|>OGILVY & MATHER<|>Ogilvy is part of Ogilvy & Mather, sharing the same focus on brand communication<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHUCK YOUNG<|>AMERITEST<|>Chuck Young is the founder of Ameritest, a company that evaluates advertising effectiveness<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NYILASY AND REID<|>OGILVY<|>Nyilasy and Reid's views on emotion in advertising align with Ogilvy's focus on persuasion<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
