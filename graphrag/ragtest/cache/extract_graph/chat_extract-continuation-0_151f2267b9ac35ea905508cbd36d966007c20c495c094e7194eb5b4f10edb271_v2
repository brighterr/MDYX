In terms of practice, managing and monitoring all of these\nmessages is an organizational problem best solved through cross-functional organization,\nwhich means a team is created involving members from all of the relevant parts of a company\nthat interact with customers, other stakeholders, and with outside agencies. Its members rep-\nresent all of the areas and tools that control contact points and interact with brand customers\nand other key stakeholders. This cross-functional team operates with a singular brand vision\nas it plans marketing communication, monitors its impact, and tracks consumer response.\nWhoisinchargeofplanningallofthesebrand-buildingopportunities?Ononehandthemar-\nketing and communication manager on the client side, such as Peter Stasiowski who was\nfeaturedearlierinthischapterintheDayintheLifebox,isincharge.Butmarketingcommu-\nnication managers work in partnership with agency managers who also provide guidance\naboutsuchthingsasIMCstrategies.EdChambliss,inhisThe InsideStory,discussesthequal-\nificationsneededtobeanIMCmanager,whetherontheclientsideortheagencyside.Youcan\nalsocheckthewebsiteattheendoftheThe InsideStoryfeatureformoreinformationonThe\nPhelpsGroup,atrueIMC-focusedagency.\nCHAPTER 2 • INTEGRATED BRAND COMMUNICATION 55\nIMC Principles and Practices\nIn Chapter 1and in this chapter we have introduced several IMC principles, as well as practices\nthat guide the use of integrated marketing communication. We’ll continue to introduce these prin-\nciples in the chapters that follow, but just to help you summarize what we’ve discussed so far,\nhere are the first four.\nFirst Principle of IMC:Everything communicates.\nPractice 1.1:Everything in the marketing mix can send a message.\nPractice 1.2:Everything a brand does, and sometimes what it doesn’t do, can send a\nmessage.\nSecondPrincipleofIMC:Abrandisaunifiedvision(theart)andacomplexsystem(thescience).\nThird Principle of IMC:Brand relationships drive brand value.\nFourth Principle of IMC:You can’t be integrated externally if you are not integrated internally.\nIntegrated marketing communication is an important philosophy, as well as practice. It is a ma-\njor theme in this book and we will continue to discuss it in the chapters that follow.\nBRAND COMMUNICATION IN A TIME OF CHANGE\nIn Chapter 1, we concluded that advertising is a dynamic industry and subject to challenges and\nchange. The same is true of marketing and all areas of marketing communication. The recession\nof the late 2000s challenged many marketing practices but some companies came through it more\neasily than others. General Mills, for example, supported its big-name brands by increasing its\nmarketing budgets. The company focused, however, on what it calls “high ROI (return on in-\nvestment) areas,” such as multicultural consumers, digital marketing,and its international mar-\nkets and global brands.19So let’s consider ways in which the practice of marketing is changing,\nparticularly in this post-recession period.\nAccountability\nSimilar to the concern for effectiveness in advertising, accountability is a hot issue in marketing.\nMarketing managers are being challenged by senior management to prove that their decisions\nlead to the most effective marketing strategies. In other words, was this the best way to launch a\nnew brand or expand into a new territory?\nJim Stengel, retired global marketing officer for P&G and now a UCLAbusiness professor,\nmentioned several of these areas in an analysis of changing practices in marketing and the need\nthey created for better measurement of effectiveness. He called attention to two major areas of\nconcern—accountability and global marketing.20Accountability is what Stengel called for in his\nquest for better measurement.\nMarketing managers are under pressure to deliver business results measured in terms of\nsales increases, the percentage share of the market the brand holds, and corporate return on in-\nvestment (ROI). The calculation of ROI determines how much money the brand made com-\npared to its expenses. In other words, what did the marketing program cost, and what did it\ndeliver in sales?\nAdvertising and other marketing communication agencies are creating tools and techniques\nto help marketers evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of their marketing communication ex-\npenditures. The Interpublic Group, for example, a large marketing communication holding com-\npany, has created the Marketing Accountability Partnership to determine what marketers’dollars\naccomplish or how they can be better used.21The issue of accountability is made more compli-\ncated by the growing use of global marketing.\nGlobal Marketing\nMarketers have moved into global markets, in some cases as a deliberate strategy and in other\ncases because international competitors have moved into their own markets. General Mills\n56 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nHere are a few brands that represent\ndifferent types of geographical\nmarketing strategies. Sainsbury’s, an\nexample of regional marketing, is the\nlargest grocery retailer in the United\nKingdom with stores in Great Britain,\nWales, Scotland, and Northern\nIreland. IKEA furniture stores are\nfound in various countries but the\ncompany keeps its base and image\nfirmly anchored in Sweden and\nrepresents Scandinavian functional\ndesign and craftsmanship. Coca-Cola,\nof course, is one of the best known\nbrands in the world and its logo is\nrecognized everywhere.\nsurvived the Great Recession by emphasizing its international markets and global brands, as well\nas multicultural consumers in all the markets, including in the United States.22\nThe growth in global marketing activities is\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSOR TOM DUNCAN<|>PERSON<|>Professor Tom Duncan is an academic featured in the book discussing integrated marketing communication (IMC) principles and practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETER STASIOWSKI<|>PERSON<|>Peter Stasiowski is a marketing and communication manager mentioned in the book as being in charge of planning brand-building opportunities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ED CHAMBLISS<|>PERSON<|>Ed Chambliss is an author who discusses the qualifications needed to be an IMC manager in his work, The Inside Story)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE PHELPS GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Phelps Group is an agency focused on integrated marketing communication (IMC))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERAL MILLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>General Mills is a company that increased its marketing budgets during the late 2000s recession to support its big-name brands)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JIM STENGEL<|>PERSON<|>Jim Stengel is a retired global marketing officer for P&G and a UCLA business professor who emphasizes accountability and global marketing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERPUBLIC GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Interpublic Group is a large marketing communication holding company that created the Marketing Accountability Partnership)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAINSBURY'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sainsbury's is the largest grocery retailer in the United Kingdom with stores in Great Britain, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IKEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IKEA is a furniture store chain with a base in Sweden, known for Scandinavian functional design and craftsmanship)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COCA-COLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Coca-Cola is one of the best-known brands in the world, with a globally recognized logo)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROFESSOR TOM DUNCAN<|>THE PHELPS GROUP<|>Professor Tom Duncan's book discusses The Phelps Group as an example of an IMC-focused agency<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETER STASIOWSKI<|>ED CHAMBLISS<|>Both Peter Stasiowski and Ed Chambliss are involved in discussions about IMC strategies and management<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERAL MILLS<|>JIM STENGEL<|>Jim Stengel's emphasis on accountability and global marketing aligns with General Mills' strategy during the recession<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERPUBLIC GROUP<|>GENERAL MILLS<|>Interpublic Group's focus on marketing accountability supports companies like General Mills in evaluating marketing effectiveness<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAINSBURY'S<|>IKEA<|>Both Sainsbury's and IKEA are examples of companies with strong geographical marketing strategies<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COCA-COLA<|>GENERAL MILLS<|>Both Coca-Cola and General Mills are examples of companies with strong global brand presence<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
