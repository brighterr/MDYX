Do you be-\nlieve these team names and logos represent negative stereotypes and, if so, what should be done\nabout them when millions of dollars have been invested in them as brands? The portrayal of Ital-\nian Americans as ignorant Mafioso types in a Verizon Wireless commercial prompted one blog-\nger to complain, “It is so common to see Italian Americans negatively portrayed by Hollywood\nand Madison Avenue that our society doesn’t think twice when we see garbage such as this. . . .”\n70 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nShould we permit the media to profit from all the unflattering and nasty stereotypes about blacks,\nJews, Asians, Muslims, Irish, and Latinos?”11\nCultural Differences in Global Advertising In the global economy advertisers seek worldwide\naudiences for their products. As they do so, advertisers sometimes make mistakes of overlaying\ntheir worldview on that of another culture without thinking about the impact of their advertising.\nMany oppose the move to a global perspective because of concerns about the homogenization of\ncultural differences. Marketing imperialismorcultural imperialismis a term used to describe\nwhat happens when Western culture is imposed on others, particularly the Middle East, Asian,\nand African cultures. Some Asian and Middle Eastern countries are critical of what they see as\nAmerica’s materialism and disrespectful behavior toward women and elders. They worry that\ninternational advertisingand media will encourage their young people to adopt these viewpoints.\nCultural differences are very real, and we will talk more about them throughout the book.\nConsider that respect for culture and local customs is so important that insensitivity to local cus-\ntoms can make an ad completely ineffective. Customs can be even stronger than laws. When ad-\nvertising to children age 12 or older was approved in Germany, for example, local customs were\nso strong that companies risked customer revolt by advertising. In many countries, naming a com-\npetitor in comparative advertising is considered bad form.\nAge-Related Stereotypes Another group that critics say is often subject to stereotyping is senior cit-\nizens, a growing segment of the population with increasing amounts of disposable income. In a focus\ngroup of women in their 50s, participants had trouble keeping their comments polite when viewing a\nseries of health care ads that showed older women in primarily sedentary activities. One explained that\neven though she has arthritis, she still wants to see ads that show arthritis sufferers working out in a\ngym, rather than “silver-haired couples walking along the beach with a golden retriever.”12\nBarbaraChampion,presidentofaresearchfirmspecializinginthematuringmarket,observed:\nThe needs of maturing consumers, depending on mental and physical acuity as well as life-\nstage factors, are often different from one another. Whether a consumer is an empty-nester\nwhose children have grown up and left home, a grandparent, a retiree, a widow, or in need\nof assisted living, for example, will greatly affect how, when, and why goods and services\nare purchased.”13\nMany of the ads for Viagra speak to a specific segment of the population and do so in a taste-\nful, tactful way.\nAdvertising to Children Marketing to youth is one of the most controversial topics in the in-\ndustry. One reason why advertising to children attracts so much attention is that children are seen\nas vulnerable. Children do not always know what is good for them and what is not. Concerned\nadults want to make sure that they protect impressionable minds from exploitation marketers.\nThey want to help children learn to make good choices.\nAcurrentissuethat’sbeingaddressedrelatestosellingsoftdrinks,candy,andfoodwithhigh\nfatandsugarcontenttochildren.Recognizingthatobesityamongyouthisamajorhealthproblem,\ntheCouncilofBetterBusinessBureauslaunchedtheChildren’sFoodandBeverageAdvertisingIni-\ntiativetohelp10majorcorporationssetguidelinestocutdownonjunkfoodadvertising.Thecom-\npanies,whichareresponsibleforproducingalmosttwo-thirdsofthefoodanddrinkadvertisingfor\nchildrenunder12,includeGeneralMills,McDonald’s,Coca-Cola,PepsiCo,Hershey,andKellogg.\nMarketing alcohol to black teens is another important issue because of the use of rappers like\nIce-T to promote malt liquors and the dozens of pages of alcohol ads that appear in black\nyouth–culture magazines such as Vibe.AGeorgetown University study contends that the alcohol\nbeverage industry is marketing far more heavily to African American young people than to oth-\ners in that age group.\nYou’ll read more about the important issue of advertising to children in the regulation sec-\ntion of this chapter.\nMessage-Related Issues Even though most advertisers try to create messages that communicate\nfairly and accurately, marketers need to understand what is not considered acceptable so they can avoid\nCHAPTER 3 • BRAND COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY 71\nunethical and even illegal behavior.
