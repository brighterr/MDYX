Millions of dollars are spent on the\nediting and design of annual reports. These re-\nports are especially important to stockholders\nand potential investors.\nSome companies publish material in print or\nonline, often called collateral material,to support\ntheir marketing public relations efforts. Corporate\npublications, marketing, and sales promotion de-\npartments and their agencies also produce training\nmaterials and sales kits to support particular cam-\npaigns. Think about the high-quality brochures\nand booklets you can pick up at car dealerships\nwhen you go in to look at new cars.

The site doesn’t like overtly\npromotional content, but a company can provide a service piece related to its business—any kind\nof “how-to” piece is welcome. For example, if you have a client that does faux painting, a gen-\neral article on the art of faux painting and how to use it as a design element can also carry a short\nbio and link to your client’s site.\nOther Tools\nIn addition to advertising, publicity, and publications, public relations practitioners have various\nother types of materials and activities in their professional toolkits.\nDVDs, CDs, Podcasts, Books, and Online Video DVDs and podcasts have become major pub-\nlic relations tools for many companies. Corporate books have also become popular with the ad-\nvent of simplified electronic publication. Costing $1,000 to $2,000 per minute to make, videos\nare not inexpensive. However, they are an ideal tool for distributing in-depth information about\na company or program. Because they are easier to duplicate, DVDs are reducing this cost. Some\ncompanies have taken stock of the YouTube phenomenon and are using online video to reduce\ncosts and draw attention to messages on corporate websites. Monsanto, for example, posted video\nclips of testimonials from farmers using Monsanto products on its site, hoping to attract cus-\ntomers, employees, and policy makers.\nSpeakers and Photos Many companies have a speakers’ bureauof articulate people who will\ntalk about topics at the public’s request. Organizations as varied as Apple Computer, Harvard Uni-\nversity, and the Children’s Hospital in Houston, Texas, all have speakers’bureaus that can arrange\npresentations to local groups and classes.\nSome publics, particularly the news media, may want pictures of people, products, places, and\nevents. That’s why PR departments maintain files of photographs that are accurate, up to date, and well\ncomposed. The permissions for ads in this book were provided because they present the advertisers in\na positive light. Companies seldom give permission to use ads that authors intend to criticize.\nDisplays and Exhibits Displays and exhibits, along with special events and tours, may be im-\nportant parts of both sales promotion and public relations programs. Displays include signage and\n478 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nbooths, racks, and holders for promotional literature. Amodel of a new condominium complex,\ncomplete with a literature rack offering brochures about its development, is an example of a dis-\nplay. Exhibits tend to be larger than displays; they may have moving parts, sound, or video and\nusually are staffed by a company representative. Booth exhibits are important at trade shows,\nwhere some companies may take orders for much of their annual sales.\nSpecial Events and Tours Some companies stage events to celebrate milestones, such as key\nanniversaries and introductions of new products.
