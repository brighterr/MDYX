One way to measure an advertisement’s effectiveness, then, is to contact consumers\nwho saw the ad and find out what they remember. Memory tests fall into two major groups: recog-\nnition tests and recall tests.\nOne way to measure memory is to show the advertisement to people and ask them whether\nthey remember having seen it before. This kind of test is called a recognition test. In a recall test,\nrespondents who have read the magazine are asked to report what they remember from the ad\nabout the brand. In aided recall tests, the interviewer may go through a deck of cards containing\nbrand names. If the respondent says, “Yes, I remember seeing an advertisement for that brand,”\nthe interviewer asks the interviewees to describe everything they can remember about the ad. Ob-\nviously recall is a more rigorous test than a recognition test.\nSimilarly, a TVcommercial is run on network television within a regular prime-time pro-\ngram. The next evening, interviewers make thousands of random phone calls until they have\ncontacted about 200 people who were watching the program at the exact time the commercial ap-\npeared. The interviewer then asks a series of questions, such as the following:\n• Do you remember seeing a commercial for any charcoal briquettes?\n• If NoDo you remember seeing a commercial for Kingsford Charcoal briquettes? (memory\nprompt)\n• If Yes to Either of the AboveWhat did the commercial say about the product? What did the\ncommercial show? What did the commercial look like? What ideas were brought out?\nThe first type of question is called an unaided recallquestion because the particular brand\nis not mentioned. The second question is an example of aided recall, in which the specific brand\nname is mentioned. The answers to the third set of questions are written down verbatim. The test\nrequires that the respondent link a specific brand name, or at least a specific product category, to\na specific commercial.\nBrand Linkage Tests Testing for brand linkage is basically a test of memorability, however,\nthe important aspect of this measure is not whether the message is remembered, but whether it\n590 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nassociates the brand with the memory. If the commercial fails to estab-\nlish a tight connection between the brand name and the selling message,\nthe commercial will not get a high recall score. This is also called a test\nof “brand linkage.” The long-running Pacific Life campaign with its im-\nage of a leaping humpback whale is a good example of a visual that\nserves as a strong brand reminder and associates the brand with strength\nand performance.\nEmotion Tests Advertising is just beginning to move into this area of re-\nsearch. There are several ways to get at the emotional response. Ameritest\nuses photo sorts with still frames from commercials to identify the posi-\ntive and negative moments that touch people’s emotions.12 Other re-\nsearchers are wiring up viewers of television ads to monitor brain activity\nusing a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine. The\nfMRI images identified ads from the 2007 Super Bowl that produced anx-\niety, fear, anger, and insecurity, as well as positive feelings.13\nLikability Tests A study by the Advertising Research Foundation\n(ARF) compared a variety of different copytesting methods to see if any\nof them were better able to predict sales impact. Surprisingly, it wasn’t\nawareness, recall, communication, or persuasion measures that won out\nbut rather likability tests.Likability, however, is not easy to measure be-\ncause it’s difficult to know if the consumer likes the ad, the brand, or some\nother factor, such as the person giving the test. Anumber of the copytest-\ning companies offer a likability score, but they suggest it needs to be in-\nPacific Life uses an image of a leaping whale terpreted relative to other consumer responses. Questions that try to\nto reflect its image of a confident insurance evaluate likability investigate factors such as these: personally relevant,\ncompany that excels in its market. important to me, stimulates interest or curiosity, creates warm feelings,\nenjoyable, entertaining, and fun.\nPersuasion Tests Another evaluative research technique is a persuasion test,or attitude change\ntest. The basic format is to ask consumers how likely they are to buy a specific brand. Next they\nare exposed to an advertisement for that brand, usually as part of a collection of brands. After ex-\nposure, researchers again ask them what they intend to purchase. The researcher analyzes the re-\nsults to determine whether intention to buy has increased as a result of exposure to the\nadvertisement. This test is sometimes referred to as an intend-to-buyormotivation test.The va-\nlidity of a persuasion test depends in part on whether participants in the experiment represent a\ngood sample of the prospects the advertiser is trying to reach. Adog food advertiser, for exam-\nple, would not be interested in responses from people who do not own dogs.\nInquiry Tests Aform of action response, inquiry testsmeasure the number of responses to an\nadvertisement. The response can be a call to a toll-free number, an e-mail or website visit, a\ncoupon return, a visit to a dealer, an entry in a contest, or a call to a salesperson. Inquiry tests are\nthe primary measurement tool for direct-response communication, but they also are used to eval-\nuate advertisements and sales promotions when the inquiry is built into the message design. In-\nquiry tests also are used to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative advertisements using a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
