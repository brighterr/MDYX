You should keep in mind that the frequency number for a media buy is actu-\nally the average number of exposure opportunities of those reached.\nBecause frequency is an average,it can be misleading. The range of frequency is often large:\nSome people see a particular brand message once, while others may see it 10 times within a given\nperiod.Average frequency,then, can give the planner a distorted idea of the plan’s performance\nbecause all of those people reached vary in the number of times they have the opportunity to be\nexposed to a message.\nSuppose a media mix includes four magazines and each magazine carries one ad a week for\nfour weeks. The total number of message insertions would be 16 (4 magazines (cid:5)1 insertion a\nSHOWCASE\nThese two posters for the Court TVtelevision program were created by Aaron Stern when he was an\naward-winning copywriter at Venables Bell & Partners in San Francisco.\nA graduate of the University of Colorado, Stern is now in New York where he\nrecently completed his MFA in Creative Writing at New York University and\nnow works as a freelance copywriter. He and his work were nominated for\ninclusion in this book by Professor Brett Robbs.\nCHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 429\nweek(cid:5)4 weeks (cid:4)16 total insertions). It is possible that a small percentage of the target audi-\nence could be exposed to all 16 insertions. It is also possible that some of the target would not\nhave the opportunity to be exposed to any of the insertions. In this case the frequency ranges from\n0 to 16. Thus, because the average frequency equals 8, you can see how misleading this average\nfrequency number can be.\nFor this reason planners often use a frequency distributionmodel that shows the percent-\nage of audience reached at each level of repetition. Afrequency quintile distribution analysis\ndivides an audience into five groups, each containing 20 percent of the audience. Employing\nmedia-usage modeling, it is then possible to estimate the average frequency for each quintile as\nshown in the following table. For example, this table shows that the bottom 20 percent has an av-\nerage frequency of 1, whereas the top 20 percent has an average frequency of 10. In this hypo-\nthetical distribution, the average frequency is 6.\nFrequency (Average Number\nQuintile of Exposure Opportunities)\nTop 20% of universe 10\n20% 7\n20% 5\n20% 3\nBottom 20% 1\nIf the media planner feels it is necessary that 80 percent of those reached should have an av-\nerage frequency of 8, then a more intensive media plan would be needed to raise the overall num-\nber of exposures; in other words, to shift the average from 6 to 8.\nEffective Frequency Because of the proliferation of information and clutter, there should be\na threshold, or minimum frequency level, that produces some type of effect, such as a request\nfor more brand information, a change in attitude toward the brand, or the most desired effect—\npurchase of the brand.\nAstandard rule of thumb is that it takes 3 to 10 exposures to have an effect on an audience.\nPrinciple\nObviously this frequency range is extremely wide. The “right” frequency number is determined\nEffective frequency means\nby several factors, including level of brand awareness, level of competitive “noise,” content of you add frequency to\nthe message, and sophistication of the target audience. Because so many different things can im- reach until you get to the\npact a response (i.e., an effect), audience response research is necessary. If the desired effect/ level where people\nresponse is not achieved, you may need to increase frequency of exposure or change the message. respond.\nResearch diagnostics, such as tracking studies, provide direction. The principle of effective fre-\nquencyis that you add frequency to reach until you get to the level where people respond.\nMedia Waste In the discussion of targeted reach we mentioned waste as a result of targeting too\nwide of a target market. Actually, there are two sides to waste—both reach and frequency. The\ngoal of media planning is to maximize media efficiency, which is to eliminate excessive overlap\nor too much frequency. Efficiency is achieved, therefore, by reducing media waste. Media pro-\nfessionals use their own experience, as well as audience research and computer models, to iden-\ntify media efficiency. The point is, when additional media weight ceases to increase the response,\nit produces waste.\nWriting Media Objectives Given this discussion of the relationship between reach and fre-\nquency, it should be clear that usable media objectives would focus on those dimensions ideally\nincluding both factors. Here are some examples of media objectives:\n1. Reach 60 percent of target audience with a frequency of 4 within each four-week period in\nwhich the advertising runs.\n2. Reach a maximum percentage of target audience a minimum of five times within the first\nsix months of advertising.\n3. Reach 30 percent of the target audiences where they have an opportunity to interact with\nthe brand and users of the brand.\n4. Reach category thought leaders and influencers in a way that will motivate them to initiate\nmeasurable word of mouth (WOM) and other positive brand messages.\n430 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nThe first of these objectives is the most common. It recognizes that you can seldom ever\nreach 100 percent of your target audience.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
