An inbound telemarketingor\nincoming telemarketing call is initiated by a customer. The consumer can be responding to an ad,\ncatalog, e-mail, or fax. L.L.Bean’s telephone representatives are trained to handle inbound calls\nin such a helpful manner that the company often features their friendly approach in its catalogs.\nCalls originating from the firm are outgoing or outbound telemarketing.These calls typically\ngenerate the most consumer resistance because they are uninvited, intrusive, and unexpected.\nTelemarketing Message Design The key point to remember about telemarketing messages is\nthat they need to be simple enough to be delivered over the telephone. If the product requires a\nvisual demonstration or a complicated explanation, then the message might be better delivered by\ndirect mail. The message also must be compelling. People resent intrusive telephone calls, so\nthere must be a strong initial benefit or reason-why statement to convince prospects to continue\nlistening. The message also must be short; most people won’t stay on the telephone longer than\ntwo to three minutes for a sales call.\nIssues: Intrusion, Fraud, and Privacy Telemarketing has its drawbacks. Perhaps the most uni-\nversally despised telemarketing tool is predictive dialing.Predictive dialing technology makes\nCHAPTER 16 • DIRECT RESPONSE 501\nit possible for telemarketing companies to call\nanyone—even those with unlisted numbers.\nSpecial computerized dialing programs use ran-\ndom dialing. This explains why, from time to\ntime, when you answer your phone you simply\nhear an empty line; the predictive dialer has\ncalled your number before a call agent is free.\nMany people consider these calls a nuisance,\nand they can even be alarming, because burglars\nhave been known to call a house to see if any-\none’s home before they attempt a break-in.\nTelemarketing’s reputation also has been\ntarnishedbyfraudulentbehavior,suchasprom-\nisingaproductorserviceinexchangeforanad-\nvance payment, convincing consumers they\nneedsomekindoffinancialorcreditprotection\nthat they don’t really need, or enticing con-\nsumers to buy something by promising them Call centers are large rooms with multiple stations for staff who make\nprizesthatarelaterdiscoveredtobeworthless. the calls (outbound) or answer calls from people placing orders\nIn response to these telemarketing abuses, the (inbound).\nFederal Trade Commission enacted the Tele-\nmarketing Sales Rule (TSR) in 1995 to protect consumers. The TSR prohibits telemarketers\nfromcallingbefore8A.M.orafter9P.M.,imposesstrictinformationaldisclosurerequirements,\nprohibitsmisrepresentativeormisleadingstatements,andprovidesforspecificpaymentcollec-\ntionprocedures.Morerecently,FTCregulationshaverequiredtelemarketingfirmstoidentify\nthemselvesonCallerID.\nThe most serious restriction on telemarketing—a program that consumers love—is imple-\nmented by state and national “do-not-call” lists. The national Do Not Call Registry had 31.6 mil-\nlion sign-ups even before it took effect in 2003 and had grown to more than 149 million by 2007.\nTelemarketing companies responded by challenging the legality of these lists in court based on\nwhat they believe to be an illegal restriction on commercial free speech. In late 2004, however,\nthe U.S. Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling that the industry’s free speech rights were\nnot violated by the do-not-call list.\nThe do-not-call lists do not restrict companies from calling their own customers, and they\nallow nonprofits to continue calling and market research firms to continue conducting phone sur-\nveys. Telemarketers subscribe to the database and check the list at least monthly for numbers they\nneed to delete. The subscription cost is $62 for each area code with a $17,000 maximum for a na-\ntional list. The no-call list registration expires after five years, so consumers are finding that they\nmay have to reregister.10\nSome phone companies offer their customers a service called “Privacy Manager” that\nscreens out sales calls. For customers who have Caller ID, numbers that register as “unavailable”\nor “unknown” are intercepted by a recorded message that asks callers to identify themselves. If\nthe caller does so, the call rings through.\nDirect-Response Advertising\nThe common thread that runs through all types of direct-response advertising is that of action.\nThe move to action is what makes direct-response advertising effective. Syracuse University\nProfessor John Philip Jones points to direct advertising as being more effective than general ad-\nvertising and says advertisers have a lot to learn from direct marketers.11\nPrint Media Ads in the mass media are less directly targeted than are direct mail and catalog,\nbut they can still provide the opportunity for a direct response. Ads in newspapers and magazines\ncan carry a coupon, an order form, an address, or a toll-free or 900 telephone number. The re-\nsponse may be either to purchase something or to ask for more information. In many cases the\ndesired response is an inquiry that becomes a sales lead for field representatives.\n502 PART 5 •\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
