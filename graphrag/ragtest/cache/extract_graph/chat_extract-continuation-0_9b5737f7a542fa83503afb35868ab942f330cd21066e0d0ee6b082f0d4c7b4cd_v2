Initiative,Spokane, WA: Marquette Books, 2006.\n468 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nWHAT KEY DECISIONS GUIDE PUBLIC RELATIONS PLANS?\nPlanning for a public relations campaign is similar to planning an advertising or IMC campaign.\nThe plan should complement the marketing and marcom strategies so the organization commu-\nnicates with one clear voice to its various publics. The plan also identifies the various key publics\nand the public relations activities that PR people use to address the interests of its various publics.\nIn addition to identifying key targets, public relations plans also specify the objectives that give\ndirection to the PR program or campaign. Assessing the effectiveness of the campaign in achiev-\ning its objectives is important, just as it is for advertising campaigns.\nResearch and SWOT Analysis\nResearch is used by an organization, as well as outside PR agencies, throughout the planning and\nimplementation of a PR plan. It’s also used afterward to determine if the effort was successful and\nif the organization is spending its money wisely on the public relations efforts.\nThe PR effort may also begin with a more formal type of background research, called a\ncommunication auditto assess the internal and external PR environment that affects the orga-\nnization’s audiences, objectives, competitors, and past results. An annual audit or a campaign-\nspecific audit can be used to ensure that a program is on track and performing as intended. Often\nbenchmarkingis used to identify baselines from previous audits or audits of other related com-\npanies and industries so there is a point of comparison. Agap analysis,which measures the dif-\nferences in perceptions and attitudes between groups or between the organization and its publics,\nmay be part of the analysis.\nPractitionerscategorizepublicssotheycandevelopeffectivepublicrelationsplanstoaddress\nissues.Theyconsiderlatentpublicsasthosewhoareunawareoftheirconnectiontoanorganiza-\ntionregardingsomeparticularproblem.Awarepublicsarethosewhorecognizetheconnections\nbetween the problem and themselves and others but who do not communicate about it.

It also wants to transform latent and aware publics into active\npublicswhowillconnectHampton’sbrandwithsavinghistoricalandculturallandmarks.\nSince public opinion is so central to public relations programs, companies often use ongo-\ning research to monitor opinions and attitudes. The Porter Novelli agency annually tracks Amer-\nican institutions’credibility and consumers’concerns about such topics as health, nutrition, and\ntheir lifestyles. The agency suggests that such information is useful in identifying people’s ori-\nentation to health messages. It’s also helpful in targeting various types of publics based on their\ngeneral attitudes toward key issues, such as antismoking. The survey has consistently found that\nthe credibility of institutions such as government, the media, and corporations is declining.\nAs in marketing or advertising planning, a PR plan begins with background research lead-\ning to a situation analysis, or SWOTanalysis, that evaluates a company’s strengths, weaknesses,\nopportunities, and threats. This analysis reflects a general understanding of the difficulty of\nchanging people’s attitudes about issues such as corporations and their role in protecting the en-\nvironment. Understanding the nature of the problem makes it easier to determine the appropriate\ncommunication objectives and the target stakeholder audiences, or publics, who will be addressed\nby the PR efforts. In public relations planning, the situation analysis can include such topics as\nchanges in public opinion, industry and consumer trends, economic trends, governmental regu-\nlations and oversight programs, and corporate strategies that affect a company’s relationships\nwith stakeholders.\nTargeting\nAs in other marketing communication areas, it is important to understand the target audience be-\nfore designing the campaign. Research is conducted to identify the appropriate publics to which\nto address the public relations message. When Hampton Hotels asked Americans their opinions,\nthey found that 9 out of 10 people believed that roadside landmarks should be saved and that most\nof those surveyed, 83 percent, thought that corporations should share the responsibility for doing\nso. Creating the “Save-A-Landmark” campaign was a natural connection between consumers and\nthe innkeeper, and research provided a key insight.\nCHAPTER 15 • PUBLIC RELATIONS 469\nObjectives and Strategies\nAvariety of objectives guides a PR plan, and the organization can use myriad strategies to carry\nout the plan.
