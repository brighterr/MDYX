In general, the FTC considers these factors:\n• Type and Specificity of ClaimFor example, Computer\nTutor claims you can learn the basics of using a com-\nputer by simply going through its three-CD set.\n• Type of ProductFedEx promises a certain delivery time,\nregardless of weather, mechanical breakdown, and so\nforth. This product has a great many uncontrollable vari-\nables compared to Heinz ketchup, which the company\npromises will be “thick.”\n• Possible ConsequencesAwebsite that claims it is se-\ncure can cause serious damage to its customers if, in\nfact, it is not.\n• Degree of RelianceBusiness-to-business customers de-\npend on the many claims made by their vendors. Therefore,\nif XPEDX (yes, that’s how it’s spelled), a manufacturer of\nboxes and other packages, claims in its ad that it can se-\ncurely deliver any size product, it had better deliver.\n• Type and Accessibility of EvidenceThe type of evidence\ncould range from testimonials from satisfied customers to\ncomplex product testing in multiple laboratories. It could be\nmade available through an 800-number request or online.\n• What Substantiation is ReasonableWhat do experts in\nthis area believe is reasonable proof of a claim?\nRemedies for Deception and Unfair Advertising Common\nsources of complaints concerning deceptive or unfair adver-\ntising practices are competitors, the public, and the FTC’s own monitors. After the FTC determines This ad claims the\nthat an ad is deceptive, the first step in the regulation process is to issue a consent decree.The FTC Chevy Equinox is the\nmost fuel efficient car\nsimply notifies the advertiser of its finding and asks the advertiser to sign a consent decree agree-\nin its category. Note\ning to stop the deceptive practice. Most advertisers do sign the decree to avoid the bad publicity.\nthe four footnotes that\nDuracell was forced to modify one of its ads after Energizer complained that the ad inferred\nexplain how the claim\nthat Duracell CopperTop batteries would last three times longer than other heavy-duty and super-\nis supported.\nheavy-duty batteries. The ad didn’t mention Energizer by name, but Energizer charged the ad was\n“false and misleading” because consumers would think the comparison was with other alkaline\nbatteries, such as Energizer. In fact, the CopperTop does not last longer than other alkaline bat-\nteries. The ad was modified with a disclaimer.36\nIt is important for students of advertising to understand the legal ramifications of deceptive\nand unfair advertising. Under some circumstances the FTC holds advertisers and their agencies\naccountable. Essentially, an agency is liable for deceptive advertising along with the advertiser\nwhen the agency is an active participant in the preparation of the ad and knows or has reason to\nknow that it is false or deceptive.\nIf a complaint seems justified, the commission can follow several courses of action:\n• Cease-and-Desist OrdersWhen an advertiser refuses to sign a consent decree and the FTC\ndetermines that the deception is substantial, it issues a cease-and-desist order.The process\nleading to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order is similar to a court trial. An administra-\ntive law judge presides. FTC staff attorneys represent the commission, and the accused par-\nties are entitled to representation by their lawyers. If the administrative judge decides in\nfavor of the FTC, the judge issues an order requiring the respondents to cease their unlawful\npractices. The advertiser can appeal the order to the full five-member commission.\n• Corrective AdvertisingThe FTC may require corrective advertisingwhen consumer re-\nsearch determines that an advertising campaign has perpetuated lasting false beliefs. Under\nthis remedy, the FTC orders the offending person or organization to produce messages for\nconsumers that correct the false impressions the ad made. The purpose of corrective adver-\ntising is not to punish an advertiser but to prevent it from continuing to deceive consumers.\nThe FTC may require a firm to run corrective advertising even if the campaign in question\nhas been discontinued.\n88 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nAlandmark corrective advertising case is Warner-Lambert v. FTC.According to the\nFTC, Warner-Lambert’s campaign for Listerine mouthwash, which ran for 50 years, had\nbeen deceiving customers, leading them to think that Listerine could prevent or reduce the\nseverity of sore throats and colds. The company was ordered to run a corrective advertising\ncampaign, mostly on television, for 16 months at a cost of $10 million.\nInterestingly, after the Warner-Lambert corrective campaign ran its course, 42 percent\nof Listerine users continued to believe that the mouthwash was being advertised as a remedy\nfor sore throats and colds, and 57 percent of users rated cold and sore throat effectiveness as\na key reason for purchasing the brand.37These results raised doubts about the effectiveness\nof corrective advertising to change impressions and have affected recent court decisions.\n• Consumer RedressThe Magnuson-Moss Warranty-FTC Improvement Act of 1975 empow-\ners the FTC to obtain consumer redress when a person or a firm engages in deceptive prac-\ntices. Ajudge can order any of the following: cancellation or reformation of contracts,\nrefund of money or return of property, payment of damages, and public notification.\nMedia Review of Advertising\nThe media attempts to regulate advertising by screening and rejecting ads that violate their stan-\ndards of truth and good taste. Most networks have a Standards and Practices Department that\nscreens every ad and gives approval before the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FTC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Federal Trade Commission is a government agency responsible for regulating advertising practices and ensuring claims are reasonable and not deceptive)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPUTER TUTOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Computer Tutor is a company that claims to teach the basics of using a computer through a three-CD set)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEDEX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FedEx is a delivery service company that promises certain delivery times despite various uncontrollable factors)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEINZ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heinz is a company known for its ketchup, which it claims to be \"thick\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XPEDX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>XPEDX is a manufacturer of boxes and other packages, claiming to securely deliver any size product)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURACELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Duracell is a battery manufacturer that was forced to modify an ad after a complaint from Energizer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENERGIZER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Energizer is a battery manufacturer that complained about a Duracell ad being misleading)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WARNER-LAMBERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Warner-Lambert is a company that was involved in a landmark corrective advertising case with the FTC regarding Listerine mouthwash)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LISTERINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Listerine is a mouthwash brand that was advertised by Warner-Lambert as preventing or reducing sore throats and colds)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FTC<|>DURACELL<|>The FTC required Duracell to modify its ad after a complaint from Energizer<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FTC<|>WARNER-LAMBERT<|>The FTC ordered Warner-Lambert to run a corrective advertising campaign for Listerine<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DURACELL<|>ENERGIZER<|>Energizer complained about a Duracell ad being misleading<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WARNER-LAMBERT<|>LISTERINE<|>Warner-Lambert advertised Listerine as preventing or reducing sore throats and colds<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
