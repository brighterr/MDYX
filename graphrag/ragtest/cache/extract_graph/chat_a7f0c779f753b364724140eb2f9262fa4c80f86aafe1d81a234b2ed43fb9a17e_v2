AND DRINKING TOO MUCH\nThe following case was written by Edward Russell, associate professor of advertising at the\nS. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New\nYork. Professor Russell is the faculty adviser to The NewHouse, a student-run advertising\nagency on the campus of Syracuse University and winner of the 2009 American Advertis-\ning Federation National Student Advertising Competition. The competition is the oldest\nand largest advertising competition in the United States.\nHow Do You Curb Binge Drinking on College Campuses?\nDrinking on college campuses is absolutely frightening! Every year there are\ncountless DUI’s,arrests,unwanted sexual advances and worst of all . . . nearly\n2,000 students a year die of alcohol poisoning. We must do something and we\nmust do something right now!\nThis isn’t a problem. Drinking is fun. College is all about meeting new peo-\nple,becoming independent from your parents and having the time of your life.\nThe problem? Both completely opposite points of view are legitimate. Drinking can be dan-\ngerous and drinking can be a fun social event. So how do you get people to stop doing\nsomething they enjoy?\nTRENDS IN COLLEGE BINGE DRINKING\nThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism’s National Advisory Council de-\nfines binge drinking as such:\nA binge is a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings blood alcohol concentration\n(BAC) to .08 or above. For a typical adult,this pattern corresponds to consum-\ning five or more drinks in a two-hour span for men or four or more drinks in a\ntwo-hour span for women.\nAccording to a U.S.-based “Monitoring the Future” study, 45% of male college stu-\ndents reported binge drinking and 37% of female students binge drink. But this isn’t a U.S.\nproblem; the same trends show up in Europe, Australia, Asia, and South America. College\nstudents drink heavily; they always have.\nYou might assume that with all of the emphasis on healthy living in our culture today\nthat binge drinking, like smoking, would be on the decline. You would be wrong. Binge\ndrinking on college campuses has remained pretty steady since 1993.\n605\n606 APPENDIX\nWhat happens to binge drinkers? According to the CORE Institute at Southern Illinois\nUniversity at Carbondale, 63% of college students reported having a hangover, 54% were\nnauseous, 38% did something they regretted later, 34% experienced memory loss, 31%\nmissed a class, etc., etc., etc. While no one would ever rationally choose to feel badly the\nnext morning, these problems aren’t such a big deal to a college student. Let’s just say, the\nrisk-to-fun ratio generally falls in favor of the fun part.\nAlthough the legal drinking age in the United States is 21, it isn’t that difficult for a\ncollege student to get alcohol on most campuses. It’s nearly impossible for the authorities\nto enforce the law as drinking gets pushed deeper and deeper underground. According to a\n2006 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, approximately 1% of 12-year-olds report\ndrinking enough to qualify as binge drinking. This percentage of the population who are\nbinge drinkers increases every year until it peaks with 50% of 21-year-olds being binge\ndrinkers.\nIt almost seems silly to ask in a college textbook why college students drink. You know\nthe answer. It can be fun. The CORE study showed that 74% say it gives them something\nto do,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
