For example, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications Ltd. hired actors to create\ncreative side of buzz about a new mobile phone that is also a digital camera. The actors pretended to be tourists\nadvertising. who wanted their picture taken, thus allowing consumers to try the product. As a typical guerilla\nmarketing campaign, it only reached those who encountered the actors. Sometimes a guerilla\nmarketing campaign will generate publicity that extends the impact.\nProduct Placement For years we have been exposed to product placement,in which a brand\nappears in a television program, movie, or even in print as a prop. With product placement, a com-\npany pays to have verbal or visual brand exposure in a movie or television program. George\nClooney’s movie Up in the Air,for example, prominently features American Airlines and Hilton\nHotels as “integrated marketers.” Media analysts estimate that Apple Computer and Pontiac each\nreceived over $25,000 in media value through placements in the television series 24.21\nProductplacementhasbecomeimportantbecauseitisn’tasintrusiveasconventionaladver-\ntising,andaudiencescan’tzaptheads,astheycanfortelevisionadvertisingusingtheremotecon-\ntroloraDVR.Atthesametime,itmaymaketheproductastar—oratleastbeassociatedwitha\nstar.Sometimestheproductplacementissubtleaswhenaparticularbrandofaspirinisshownina\nmedicinechestoracharacterdrinksaparticularbrandofbeverage.Inothercases,thebrandisfront\nCHAPTER 11 • MEDIA BASICS 343\nThese painted stairs at\nthe Denver Pavilions\nand the entertainment\ncomplex in downtown\nDenver is an example\nof guerilla marketing.

Both the Coca-Cola\nbrand and the Ford Motor brand have been embedded into the successful talent show American\nIdol,and the Target bulls-eye is frequently seen as part of the action sets and props on Survivor.\nThe greatest advantage of product placement is that it demonstrates product use in a natural\nsetting (“natural” depending on the movie) by people who are celebrities. It’s unexpected and, if\nit’s an obvious use, may catch the audience when their resistance to advertising messages may be\ndialed down. It’s also good for engaging the affections of other stakeholders, such as employees\nand dealers, particularly if the placement is supported with its own campaign.\nThe biggest problem is that the placement may not be noticed. There is so much going on in most\nmovies that unless you can overtly call attention to the product, its appearance may not register. Amore\nserious problem occurs when there is not a match between the product and the movie or its audience.\nAnother concern is that advertisers have no idea whether the movie will be a success or failure as they\nnegotiate a contract for the placement. If the movie is a dud, what does that do to the brand’s image?\nAnother problem is an ethical one—when is a product placement inappropriate? For exam-\nple, some pharmaceutical marketers have found that a product “plug” can be a way around the\nFDA’s requirements on the disclosure of side effects.
