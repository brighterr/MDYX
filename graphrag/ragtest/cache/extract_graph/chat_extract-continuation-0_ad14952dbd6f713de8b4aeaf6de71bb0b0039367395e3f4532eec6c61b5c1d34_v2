In other words, advertising works if it achieves its objectives. achieves its objectives.\nAward Shows This chapter opened with the Burger King campaign, which was identified as\naward-winning advertising. The Effie award, named for a shortened form of the word effective,is\ngiven by the New York Chapter of the American Marketing Association (AMA) to advertising and\nother forms of marketing communication that have been proven to be not only creative, but more\nimportantly, effective. That means the campaigns were guided by measurable objectives, and eval-\nuation after the campaign determined that the effort did, in fact, meet or exceed the objectives.\n(Check out the Effies at www.effie.org.) Other award shows that focus on effectiveness are the Ad-\nvertising and Marketing Effectiveness (AME) awards by the New York Festivals company,\nCanada’s Cassie Awards, and the London-based Institute of Practitioners (IPA) Award. Check out\nthese award programs at www.ameawards.com,www.cassies.ca,andwww.ipa.co.uk.\nOther award shows judge factors such as creative ideas, for example, the Clios by a private\naward-show company, a New York–based advertising association’s One Show, and the Cannes\nLions Awards by a French award-show company. Awards are also given for media plans\n(Adweek’s Media Plan of the Year) and art direction (New York–based Art Directors Club award\nshow). These awards can be found at www.clioawards.com,www.canneslions.com,www.adweek\n.com,andwww.adcglobal.org/awards/annual.\nOther professional areas also have award shows that reward such things as clever promo-\ntional ideas. For example, the Reggies are given by the Promotion MarketingAssociation, and\noutstandingpublicrelationseffortsarerecognizedbythePublicRelationsSocietyofAmerica’s\nSilverAnvilAward.\nIntegrated Marketing Communication (IMC)\nWe mentioned that effectiveness is a central theme for this book, but another concept that we will\ndiscuss throughout is integration. As we mentioned earlier in our timeline, the search for effective\ncommunication has led many companies to focus on the consistency of their brand communication\nin order to more efficiently establish a coherent brand perception. We call that practice integrated\nmarketing communicationorIMC. In other words, everything that sends a brand message is a point\nof concern for those managing brand communication. To be effective, these messages need to com-\nplement one another and present the same basic brand strategy.\n28 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nThe point is that brand communication involves more than just advertising. We refer to the\nFirst Principle\nof IMC First Principle of IMCaseverything communicates.And that means all marketing communica-\nEverything tionmedia(print, broadcast, out-of-home, and digital), as well as all marketing communication\ncommunicates. platforms(advertising, public relations, events and sponsorships, and direct response) and other\nnew forms, such as guerilla marketing and online social media. All communication efforts are\nplanned for maximum synergy.\nLooking Ahead\nThis chapter has provided an introduction to many of the basic concepts of advertising, as well as\nIMC. We’ll continue that introduction of principles and practices in Chapter 2as we explain the\nbigger picture of advertising and its role in marketing communication and marketing. Marketing\ncommunication agencies play an important role in puzzling out new ways to interact with cus-\ntomers and cement brand relationships.\nIT’S A WRAP\nBest Burger, Best Campaign,\nBest Practices\nThe focus on effectiveness and results is the theme of this textbook, and throughout the book we will in-\ntroduce you to practices that generate effectiveness. We’ll end each chapter with the results of the cam-\npaign that introduced the chapter—in this case, the Grand Effie–winning “Whopper Freakout” campaign for\nBurger King. The freakout campaign for Whopper’s 50th anniversary demonstrates the power of having a\nbrand identity so strong that customers not only remember it, but demand it.\nSo here’s the rest of the Whopper story. It’s a story of consumer shock and outrage: “If Burger King doesn’t\nhave the Whopper, they might as well change their name to Burger Queen,” and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BURGER KING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Burger King is a global fast-food chain known for its signature Whopper burger and award-winning advertising campaigns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN MARKETING ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The New York Chapter of the American Marketing Association is responsible for giving the Effie award for effective advertising and marketing communication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EFFIE AWARD<|>EVENT<|>The Effie award is given to advertising and marketing campaigns that have proven to be effective, with measurable objectives and successful outcomes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADVERTISING AND MARKETING EFFECTIVENESS (AME) AWARDS<|>EVENT<|>The AME awards are given by the New York Festivals company to recognize effective advertising and marketing campaigns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASSIE AWARDS<|>EVENT<|>Canada's Cassie Awards recognize effective advertising and marketing campaigns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUTE OF PRACTITIONERS (IPA) AWARD<|>EVENT<|>The London-based IPA Award recognizes effective advertising and marketing campaigns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIOS<|>EVENT<|>The Clios are awards given by a private award-show company for creative ideas in advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONE SHOW<|>EVENT<|>The One Show is an award event by a New York-based advertising association recognizing creative advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANNES LIONS AWARDS<|>EVENT<|>The Cannes Lions Awards are given by a French award-show company for excellence in creative advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADWEEK'S MEDIA PLAN OF THE YEAR<|>EVENT<|>Adweek's Media Plan of the Year awards recognize outstanding media planning in advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ART DIRECTORS CLUB AWARD SHOW<|>EVENT<|>The Art Directors Club award show, based in New York, recognizes excellence in art direction in advertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGGIES<|>EVENT<|>The Reggies are awards given by the Promotion Marketing Association for clever promotional ideas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC RELATIONS SOCIETY OF AMERICA'S SILVER ANVIL AWARD<|>EVENT<|>The Silver Anvil Award recognizes outstanding public relations efforts)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BURGER KING<|>EFFIE AWARD<|>Burger King's Whopper Freakout campaign won the Grand Effie award for its effectiveness<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN MARKETING ASSOCIATION<|>EFFIE AWARD<|>The New York Chapter of the American Marketing Association gives the Effie award<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BURGER KING<|>WHOPPER FREAKOUT<|>The Whopper Freakout campaign was a successful advertising campaign by Burger King<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
