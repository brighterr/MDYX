They Are Loyal\nto Themselves\nAs I, along with my marketing and advertising agency colleagues, strive to reignite consumers’\nemotional bond with the Holiday Inn power brand, I think back to a basic fact about consumers.\nThis is that consumers demonstrate loyalty to certain brands because those brands say some-\nthing about them, as human beings, that they like.\nConsumers who are loyal to Dunkin’Donuts, which is a down-to-earth, approach-\nable brand, relish the fact that carrying a Dunkin’cup says to others that they, person-\nally, are down to earth and approachable.\nConsumers who are loyal to Jeep Wrangler, which may symbolize an unconven-\ntional attitude and a sense of adventure, love the fact that driving a Wrangler informs\nothers that they, too, are unconventional and adventurous.\nWhen a brand fails to convey a soul or essence that matches personal characteristics\nthat consumers value, a brand lacks meaning; in the competitive marketplace, it blends in with\nall other bland brands that lack charisma. On the other hand, when a brand becomes a badge that\nconsumers are proud of displaying, that brand becomes interwoven into consumers’everyday lives.\nHoliday Inn is a power brand for many reasons. Perhaps most importantly, it is a brand that\nRegina Lewis, is comfortable in its own skin . . . a brand that doesn’t need to be showy, but that celebrates the\nVice President of Con- joys of travel, work, and family in practical ways. Holiday Inn is a place where people can be\nsumer Insights for the themselves, where people can live their lives while away from home with the feeling of comfort\nInterContinental Hotel that home provides. For people who are unpretentious, Holiday Inn offers “real-world” lodging\nGroup. with genuine service.\n94\nChapter 4 • How Marketing Communication Works\nChapter 5 • Segmenting and Targeting the Audience\nChapter 6 • Strategic Research\nChapter 7 • Strategic Planning\nAs I, along with my marketing and advertising agency teams, ensure that Holiday Inn retains\nits place in the hearts and minds of guests, I heed the following set of principles:\n1. FeelBecause all human decisions involve some emotional component, no purely rational ad-\nvertising approach can offer sustainable advantage. An advertisement must make folks “feel”\nsomething!\n2. ConnectAll advertising must not only contain an emotional component, it also must get that\nemotion right. It must nail a way in which folks want to see either their world or themselves.\n3. IdentifyWhile all consumers are individuals, we also can identify groups of consumers who\nthink and feel the same way; identifying and understanding these groups is at the root of strate-\ngic planning.\n4. UnderstandTo effectively deliver emotion through advertising, we must avoid “group think”;\nsometimes, the most powerful idea can come from one consumer’s story . . . and the most\npowerful message can be imagined by one brilliant creative mind that understands the minds\nof the target audience.\n5. SmileWhile economic times are tough at the time I am writing this essay, it is critical to re-\nmember that people want to feel happy! Just as songs that made people smile were celebrated\nduring the Great Depression, advertising that makes people smile will always be meaningful\nwhen life feels difficult.\nThese principles will be explained further in the chapters that make up Part 2. Chapter 4an-\nswers the big picture question of “How does advertising and other marketing communication\nwork?” Effectiveness factors are spelled out using the Facets Model of Effects. Building on that\ndiscussion as a foundation, Chapter 5introduces the consumer audience and discusses how tar-\ngeting works. Chapter 6introduces the basics of research used to understand consumers and the\nmarketplace. Finally, Chapter 7explains that ideas about how advertising works, as well as how\nconsumers think and behave, come together in a strategic plan.\n95\n4\nHow Marketing\nCommunication Works\nIt’s a Winner\nCampaign: Company: Agency: Award:\n“Ford SYNC” Ford Zubi Advertising 2009 Silver Effie,\nServices\nCategory: Hispanic\nR\nE\nT\nP\nA\nH\nC\nFPO\n96\nCHAPTER KEY POINTS\n1.

The\nstory behind Ford’s campaign for its new SYNC technology will give you\nsome insights about how effective advertising works.\nFord faced a significant challenge as it tried to convince potential consumers\nof its small to medium-sized Focus and Edge vehicles that the vehicles had some\ntechnological advantages. First, Ford is known for its tough, dependable trucks,\nnot as a technology leader. Consumers perceived competitors like Nissan Sentra,\nHonda Civic, Scion, Toyota Corolla, and VW Rabbit or Jetta as being technologi-\ncally superior. Second, not only did Ford need to overcome the perception that\nforeign-made automobiles were more technologically advanced, it needed to\nmake the audience aware of its new innovation, which was practically invisible.\nAbout all Ford had to show potential buyers was a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>REGINA LEWIS<|>PERSON<|>Regina Lewis is the Vice President of Consumer Insights for the InterContinental Hotel Group, contributing to brand loyalty strategies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLIDAY INN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Holiday Inn is a power brand known for providing comfortable and genuine service, allowing guests to feel at home while traveling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The InterContinental Hotel Group is a global hospitality company that owns Holiday Inn and focuses on consumer insights and brand loyalty)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ford is an automotive company known for its tough, dependable trucks and is working to position itself as a technology leader with its SYNC technology)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYNC<|>EVENT<|>SYNC is Ford's new technology aimed at enhancing the technological appeal of its small to medium-sized vehicles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZUBI ADVERTISING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Zubi Advertising is the agency responsible for Ford's \"Ford SYNC\" campaign, which won a 2009 Silver Effie in the Hispanic Services category)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REGINA LEWIS<|>INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL GROUP<|>Regina Lewis is the Vice President of Consumer Insights at the InterContinental Hotel Group<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLIDAY INN<|>INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL GROUP<|>Holiday Inn is a brand owned by the InterContinental Hotel Group<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORD<|>SYNC<|>Ford developed the SYNC technology to enhance the technological appeal of its vehicles<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORD<|>ZUBI ADVERTISING<|>Zubi Advertising created the \"Ford SYNC\" campaign for Ford<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
