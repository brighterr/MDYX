Offer a dealthat promises a discount or a freebie as a prize.\n2. Use an involvement devicesuch as a challenge or contest.\n3. Change the offer frequently,perhaps even daily. One of the reasons people surf the Inter-\nnet is to find out what’s happening now. Good ads exploit “nowness” and “newsiness.”\n4. Keep the writing succinctbecause most surfers have short attention spans and get bored easily.\n5. Focussurfers’attentionbyaskingprovocativequestionsorofferingknowledgetheycanuse.\n6. Use the advertisementto solicit information and opinions from users as part of your re-\nsearch. Reward surfers for sharing their opinions with you by offering them three free days\nof a daily horoscope or something else they might find fun or captivating.\nSometimes banners provide brand reminder information only, like a billboard, but they usually\nalso invite viewers to clickon the banner to link to an ad or the advertiser’s home page. The effec-\ntiveness of such efforts is monitored in part by the number of click-throughs.Their creators make ban-\nners entertaining by using multimedia effects such as animation and sound, interactivity, emotional\nappeals, color, and provocative headlines. One mistake copywriters sometimes make, however, is to\nforget to include the company name or brand in the banner or ad. Surfers should be able to tell imme-\ndiately what product or brand the banner is advertising. Effective banner ads satisfy the need for en-\ntertainment, information, and context (a link to a product), and often use promotional incentives, such\nas prizes or gifts, to motivate visitors to click through to the sponsor’s website13to drive action.\nInternet Ads\nSimilar in some ways to traditional advertising, Internet ads are designed to create awareness and\ninterest in a product and build a brand image. In terms of creating interest, good copywriting\nworks well in any medium, including the Internet. The “Ocean Speaks” ads in The Inside Story\nat www.pearsonhighered.com/moriarty illustrates how the same writing style can transfer from\nprint to the Internet and maintain a consistent brand personality. The scuba diving industry wanted\nto revive interest in the sport of scuba, both with current divers and potential newcomers. The ob-\njective of this striking campaign was to move people from print to the company’s website.\nArt director Chris Hutchinson explains, “We created a campaign in the literal voice of the\nocean. The Ocean irreverently compares itself to the dull world up above and invites people to\ncome down for a visit. Instead of using traditional beauty shots of scuba diving, we commissioned\nsurreal organic underwater scenes.” The ads were featured in Archive,an international collection\nof the best advertising, television, and poster images.\nIn contrast to the Ocean speaking campaign, Burton Snowboards uses copy that speaks in\nthe voice of the product’s user, but the copy also creates an association with a distinctive brand\nand user personality.\nIt also uses its corporate mission statement as copy that speaks in the same tone of voice.\nThis is another creative website. Check it out at www.burton.com.\nLESSONS ABOUT COPYWRITING\nAs discussed throughout this chapter, the copywriter’s job is to find a memorable way to express\nthe creative concept. All of a copywriter’s talent will do no good if the audience cannot under-\nstand the “magic words.” Understanding the words, as well as the creative idea, is particularly\ncomplicated in global brand communication.\nWriting for a Global Brand\nLanguage affects the creation of the advertising, which is a problem for global campaigns. En-\nglish is more economical than many other languages. This creates a major problem when the\nspace for copy is laid out for English and one-third more space is needed for French or Spanish.\nHowever, English does not have the subtlety of other languages such as Greek, Chinese, or\nFrench. Those languages have many different words for situations and emotions that do not trans-\nlate precisely into English. Standardizing the copy content by translating the appeal into the\n284 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nlanguage of the foreign market is fraught with possible communication blunders. It is rare to find\na copywriter who is fluent in both the domestic and foreign language and familiar with the cul-\nture of the foreign market.\nHeadlines in any language often rely on humor or a play on words, themes that are relevant\nto one country, or slang. Because these verbal techniques don’t cross borders well, copywriters\nremove them from the advertising unless the meaning or intent can be re-created in other lan-\nguages. For this reason, international campaigns are not literally translated word by word. In-\nstead, a copywriter usually rewrites them in the second language. An ad for a Rome laundry\nshows how a poor translation can send the wrong message: “Ladies, leave your clothes here and\nspend the afternoon having a good time.”\nAlthough computer words and advertising terms are almost universally of English deriva-\ntion, some languages simply do not have words equivalent to other English expressions. Since\n1539 the French have had legislation to keep their language “pure”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
