If there wasn’t\nour lives; an item we want a mass desire for this type of vehicle, there would be no market for the Prius. On the other hand, there\nis something we desire. is also a market for the Cadillac Escalade. Related to needs and wants are satisfaction and dissonance.\n• SatisfactionAfeeling of satisfaction is only one possible response to a brand message or\nbrand experience; more troublesome is dissatisfaction or doubt. People can pay attention to a\ncommercial, then buy a product and be disappointed. One of the reasons is that advertising\nsometimes raises consumers’expectations too high, in other words, it promises more than it\ncan deliver.\n• DissonanceCognitive dissonancerefers to a conflict between two thoughts—you want to\nbuy a car but don’t have the money. That creates a state of tension. Marketers must address\nthe negative side and, in auto marketing, they do that by offering no or low interest plans to\nreduce the conflict and make it easier to justify or rationalize the decision. Buyer’s remorse\nis another form of tension and it occurs when there are discrepancies between what we\nthought we would receive and what we actually received. When there is a difference be-\ntween reality and facts, people engage in a variety of activities to reduce cognitive disso-\nnance. Most notably, we seek out information that supports our decisions—that’s why we\npay attention to ads for products we have already bought—and ignore and distort informa-\ntion that does not. For example, car makers use testimonials from satisfied customers. An\nimportant category of automotive service called “aftermarketing” is designed to keep cus-\ntomers happy after they buy a car.\nMotivations Amotiveis an internal force—like the desire to look good—that stimulates you to\nbehave in a particular manner. This driving force is produced by the tension caused by an unful-\nfilled want or need. People strive to reduce the tension, as the Airborne ad demonstrates. At any\ngiven point you are probably affected by a number of different motives—your motivation to buy\nCHAPTER 5 • SEGMENTING AND TARGETING THE AUDIENCE 137\na new suit will be much higher if you have several job inter-\nviews scheduled next week.\nResearch into motivation uncovers the “why” questions:\nWhy did you buy that brand and not another? What prompted\nyou to go to that store? Understanding buying motives is cru-\ncial to advertisers because the advertising message should re-\nflect consumers’ motivations. Unfortunately motivations\noperate largely at an unconscious level. Some of the reasons\nmay be apparent—you go to a restaurant because you are hun-\ngry. But what else governs that choice—is it location, interior\ndecoration, a favorite menu item, or the recommendation of a\nfriend?\nIn our discussion in Chapter 4 of routine or habit ap-\nproachestoconsumerdecisionmaking,wenotedthelackof\nconsciousthoughtaboutmanydecisions.Thatistruealsofor\ndecisions that are driven by emotions and feelings.
