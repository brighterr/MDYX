It begins with a rolling transmission bearing, and moves\nthrough valves, brake pedals, tires, the hood, and so forth, until the car drives away at the end of\nthe commercial. It’s tempting to think it was created through computer animation, but the Honda\n“Cog” commercial was filmed in real time without any special effects. It took 606 takes for the\nwhole thing to work—that’s 606 run-throughs of the sequence! One of the most talked-about\nspots ever made, the publicity given to the commercial was probably even more valuable than\nan advertising buy. The “Cog” commercial won a Grand Clio (a creative award show), as well\nas a Gold Lion at the Cannes Advertising Festival. Altogether, it picked up no fewer than\n20 awards from various UK and international organizations. The spot can be seen at\nwww.ebaumsworld.com/flash/play/734.10\nPostproduction For film and video, much of the work happens after the shoot in postproduction—\nwhen the commercial begins to emerge from the hands and mind of the editor. The objective of\nediting is to assemble the various pieces of film into a sequence that follows the storyboard. Ed-\nitors manipulate the audio and video images, creating realistic 3-D images and combining real-\nlife and computer-generated images. The postproduction process is hugely important in video\nbecause so many digital effects are being added to the raw film after the shoot. In the “Cat\nHerders” commercial, Fallon could not film the cats and horses at the same time because of Na-\ntional Humane Society regulations. The director had to film the horses, background, and kitties\nseparately. An editor fused the scenes together during postproduction, editing seamlessly to cre-\nate the illusion of the elaborate cat drive.\nAnother goal of video editingis to manipulate time, which is a common technique used in\ncommercial storytelling. Condensing time might show a man leaving work, then a cut of the man\nshowering, then a cut of the man at a bar. The editor may extend time. Say a train is approaching\na stalled car on the tracks. By cutting to various angles it may seem that the train is taking forever\nto reach the car—a suspense tactic. To jumble time, an editor might cut from the present to a flash-\nback of a remembered past event or flash forward to an imagined scene in the future. All of these\neffects are specified by the art director in the storyboard.\nThe result of the editor’s initial work is a rough cut,a preliminary edited version of the story\nthat is created when the editor chooses the best shots and assembles them to create a scene. The\neditor then joins the scenes together. After the revision and reediting have been completed,\nthe editor makes an interlock, which means the audio and film have been assembled together.\nThe final version with the sound and film mixed together is called an answer print.The answer\nCHAPTER 10 • VISUAL COMMUNICATION 315\nA MATTER OF PRACTICE\nBU Ad Class Ready for Its Close-Up\nTom Fauls,College of Communication, Boston University\nIt can be quiet, even sleepy, during uniformed McDonald’s workers with McCafé drinks, and\nsummer term.
