Because of its interactive dimension,\ntheWebismovingdirectmarketersmuchclosertoone-to-onemarketing.\nThe technology of the Internet also has produced dramatic changes in the direct-mail indus-\ntry. At a most basic level, the Internet has facilitated the ease in producing and distributing tradi-\ntional direct mail by e-mail. E-mail marketing software and advertising assistance is available\nfrom such companies as Constant Contact (www.constantcontact.com), which even provides e-\nmail templates. Services such as Constant Contact and MailNow offers a streamlined process that\nallows users to point-and-click their way through a series of predesigned e-mailer templates\npriced and sorted by industry, as well as select mailing lists and various mail media (postcards,\nletters, flyers, or newsletters). Customers can customize the mailer with their logo and other pro-\nprietary images or copy.\nAnother feature of Internet direct marketing is greater sampling opportunities. Online\nmusic stores now have hundreds of thousands of music clips for shoppers to listen to before\nmaking a purchase. Eddie Bauer lets site visitors “try on” clothes in a virtual dressing room.\nIt also sends them e-mail messages offering special prices on items based on their past pur-\nchasing patterns.\nToday, the use of extensive database information and innovative e-mail technology, com-\nbined with creative marketing strategies, has brought the benefits of highly personalized, inex-\npensive messages to far-reaching mass campaigns. E-mail marketing is developing and becoming\nmore strategic as new technologies are developed. Three basic types of e-mail campaigns are used\nin marketing communication:\n• Addressable to current customers\n• Addressable to prospects\n• Unsolicited and often unwanted, or spam.\nAn option in the “addressable” category is one that is still evolving and that is the idea of sending\nautomated direct marketing messages via GPS-enabled mobile devices, such as iPhones. Various\n504 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\ninnovations are being tested to make these geomarketing tech-\nniques useful without becoming a privacy issue.13\nWell-known corporate brands such as BMWare using e-\nmail as a DMC tool. In one campaign, the company invited ex-\nisting and prospective customers to view a collection of Web\nmovies about new BMW models. Another campaign notified\nBMWowners of a new section at BMW.comreserved strictly for\ntheir use. Called the “Owner’s Circle,” the section allows own-\ners to obtain special services and set up profiles that track main-\ntenance items specific to their cars. Shortly after the mailing,\nenrollment in the Owner’s Circle doubled, and participation in\nBMW’s financial services program tripled.\nIssue: Spam Although e-mail marketing has enjoyed in-\ncreased success, the practice has received intense criticism for\ngenerating too much unwanted e-mail, otherwise known as\nspam.The FTC has determined that 90 percent of all spam in-\nvolving business and investment opportunities contains false or\nmisleading information. The problem also exists with nearly\nhalf of the messages promoting health products and travel and\nleisure. This is why Congress passed the CAN-SPAM Act in\n2003. The problem is so big that some industry experts estimate\nthat more than half of all e-mail messages are spam.\nTelevision shopping networks handle sales orders by\nAmazon has filed lawsuits in U.S. and Canadian courts to\nusing hundreds of customer service agents.\nstop e-mail spammers it says have been fraudulently using its\nidentity to send out spam, a practice known as spoofing.Face-\nbook has been plagued with spam and began offering its users\na complimentary six-month subscription to McAfee’s Internet Security Suite, which railroads\nspam as well as viruses.14One of the largest e-mail marketers, OptInRealBig, has been sued by\nthe state of New York for allegedly sending misleading and fraudulent e-mail solicitations.

Spammers solicit business from sources like AOL’s profiles where\npeople indicate their interests and activities. Aspammer might send out 100,000 e-mails and get\nonly two to five clients, which seems like a totally unacceptable number of responses. But a spam-\nmer who charges $300 to send out 100,000 messages or $900 for a million might make $14,000\nto $15,000 on those few responses.
