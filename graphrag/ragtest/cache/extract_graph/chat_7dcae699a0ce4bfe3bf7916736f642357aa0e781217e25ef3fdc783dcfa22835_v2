This premium ice cream uses only\nall-natural ingredients, and bee pollination is essential for ingredients in nearly half\nof its flavors. It’s in the best interest of the company, as well as the bees, to resolve\nthe problem. This is the story about how a company practices social responsibility,\nor shows concern for the welfare of others, and profits from the experience.\nFaced with a need to ramp up sales and inject zip into the Häagen-Dazs brand\n(whose main competitor is funkier, socially conscious Ben & Jerry’s), the client\nasked its ad agency, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, and the PR firm Ketchum to\naccomplish these objectives with no increase in budget. In such a situation, it made\nsense to generate a buzz that could extend the impact of its message beyond the\nlimited media budget for advertising. What Häagen-Dazs discovered was a prob-\nlem more important than the brand.\nSummarizing the situation, three factors led to the big idea for the campaign:\na brand known for its all-natural ingredients, consumers who are increasingly con-\ncerned about sustainability and environmental issues, and a critical issue. The idea\ncentered on a simple equation: 1/2 of Häagen-Dazs ice cream flavors (cid:2)1/3 of what\nwe eat (cid:3)honeybees = a bigger-than-ice-cream problem.\nTo help find a solution, Häagen-Dazs’s ad agency, Goodby, Silverstein & Part-\nners, and public relations firm, Ketchum, created the “Häagen-Dazs Loves Honey\nBees” program. Häagen-Dazs kicked off its multifaceted efforts to help solve the\nhoneybee mystery by giving substantial research grants to Penn State and UC\nJef I. Richards, University of Texas, and Joseph E.
