As part of a major two-year study and\nCHAPTER 6 • STRATEGIC RESEARCH 173\nredesign of the labels on its iconic red and white soup cans, Campbell’s used neuromarketing\ntechniques to see how consumers reacted to everything from pictures of bowls, to the use of a\nspoon, and other graphic cues, such as steam rising from the bowl.

Media planners often work in conjunction with\nthe information account planners uncover to decide which media formats make the most sense to\naccomplish the objectives. The goal is to activate consumer interest by reaching them through\nsome medium that engages their interest.\nNext, media research gathers information about all the possible media and marketing\ncommunicationtoolsthatmightbeusedinacampaigntodeliveramessage.Mediaresearchers\nthenmatchthatinformationtowhatisknownaboutthetargetaudience.TheMRIdatashown\nearlier in Figure 6.1 illustrates the type of information media researchers consult to develop\nrecommendations.\nMessage Development Research As planners, account managers, and people on the creative\nteam begin to develop a message strategy, they involve themselves in various types of informal\nand formal message development research.They read all of the relevant secondary information\nprovided by the client and the planners to become better informed about the brand, the company,\nthe competition, the media, and the product category. As Jackie Boulter,7head of planning at the\nLondon-based Abbott Mead Vickers-BBDO agency, explained, creative development research is\nfocused on refining message ideas prior to production. It uses qualitative research to predict if the\nidea will solve the business problem and achieve the objectives.\nSometimes called concept testing,it can help evaluate the relative power of various creative\nideas. It’s a “work-in-progress” type of evaluation. The idea is to test the big idea that communi-\ncates the strategy behind the message—or various types of executionsof the concept. These in-\nterviews are often conducted in malls and downtown areas where there are lots of people who can\nbe asked to look at a rough sketch of the idea or ad and respond to it. They can also be conducted\nover the phone, by mail, or online.\nAs writers and art directors begin working on a specific creative project, they almost always\nconduct informal research of their own. They may do their own personal observational research\nand visit retail stores, talk to salespeople, and watch customers buy. They may visit the agency\ninformation center or library, browse through reference books, and borrow subject and picture\nfiles. They will look at previous advertising, especially that of competitors, to see what others\nhave done, and in their hearts they will become convinced that they can create something better\nthan, and different from, anything that has been done before. This informal, personal research has\na powerful influence on what happens later in the message development process.\nAnother technique used to analyze the meaning of communication is semiotic analysis,\nwhich is a way to take apart the signs and symbols in a message to uncover layers and types of\nmeanings. The objective is to find deeper meanings in the symbolism that might be particular to\ndifferent groups of consumers. Its focus is on determining the meanings, even if they are not ob-\nvious or highly symbolic, that might relate to consumer motivations.\nFor example, the advertising that launched General Motors’ OnStar global positioning\nsystem (GPS) used a Batman theme.
