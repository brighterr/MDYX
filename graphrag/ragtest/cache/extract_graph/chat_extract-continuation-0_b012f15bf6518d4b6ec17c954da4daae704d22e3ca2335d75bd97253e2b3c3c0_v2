Called a designated marketing area (DMA),the coverage\narea is referred to by the name of the largest city in the area. This is a national market analy-\nsis system, and every county in the United States has been assigned to a DMA. The assign-\nment of a county to a DMAis determined by which city provides the majority of the county\nhouseholds’TVprogramming. Most DMAs include counties within a 50- to 60-mile radius\nof a major city center. Even though this system is based on TVbroadcast signals, it is uni-\nversally used in doing individual market planning.\n• Consumer Behavior ReportsWe mentioned some of the consumer research sources in\nChapter 5that are used in developing segmentation and targeting strategies. They are also\nuseful in planning media strategies. For example, media planners use such services as the\nClaritas PRIZM system, Nielsen’s ClusterPlus system, and supermarket scanner data to lo-\ncate the target audience within media markets.\nThe Media Plan\nThemedia planis a written document that summarizes the objectives and strategies that guide\nhow media dollars will be spent. The goal of a media plan is to find the most effective and effi-\ncient ways to deliver messages to a targeted audience. Media plans are designed to answer the fol-\nlowing questions: (1) who (target audience), (2) what for (objectives), (3) where (the media\nvehicles used), (4) where (geography), (5) when (time frame), (6) how big (media weight), and\n(7) at what cost (cost efficiency). The first three are media objectives and the second group rep-\nresents media strategies. To see where media planning and buying fit into the overall advertising\nprocess, see Figure 14.3, which outlines the primary components of a media plan.\nWhen IMC planners develop a media plan, they also take into consideration contact\npoints. These include exposure to traditional mass media, as well as word of mouth, place-\nbased media, in-store brand exposures, and the new, interactive media. We’ll discuss the IMC\ndimension of media planning at the end of this chapter. To help you better understand the role\nof media planners, read the discussion of a week in the life of a media planner in the accom-\npanying feature.\nWHAT ARE THE KEY STEPS IN MEDIA PLANNING?\nMedia planning is more than just choosing from a long list of media options. Traditional\nmeasured mediaare chosen based on such metrics as GRPs and CPMs, which are explained later\nin this chapter, but the new media lack similar metrics and are characterized more by such con-\nsiderations as the quality of the brand experience, involvement, and personal impact. Old-line ad-\nvertising media planners are intent on buying reach and frequency, but the problem is that many\nof their clients are looking for more effective outcomes, such as engaging experiences and brand-\nCHAPTER 14 • MEDIA PLANNING AND BUYING 425\nFIGURE 14.3\nMarketing Communication\nThe Components of a\nPlan and Strategies\nMedia Plan\nMedia Planning Message Planning\nTarget and The Creative\nMedia Research Brief\nMedia Message\nObjectives Objectives\nBig Idea\nMedia Mix\nSelection\nMessage Execution\nScheduling\nand\nBudgeting Copywriting\nMedia Buying Design and\nProduction\nMedia\nAdaptions for IMC\nTactics\nareas & international\ncampaigns\nMonitoring\nEvaluation\nEvaluation\nObjectives and\nEffects\nCopy Testing\nPerformance\nResults\nbuilding relationships. Thus, the framework for making media-planning decisions is changing\nalong with the list of media options.\nThe four basic steps in media planning are targeting, setting media objectives, developing\nmedia strategies, and analyzing the metrics of a media plan.\nStep 1: Target Audience\nAkey strategic decision is identifying a target audience. In media planning, the challenge is to se-\nlect media vehicles that (1) are compatible with the creative executions and (2) whose audiences\nA WEEK IN THE LIFE\nWhat Do I DO\nas a Media Planner?\nHeather Beck,Senior Media Planner, Melamed Riley Advertising, Cleveland, Ohio\nPeople often ask me what it is that I DO all day at work. about their projects with their counterparts on the client\nThere are 12 media planners in my office, and each of us side.
