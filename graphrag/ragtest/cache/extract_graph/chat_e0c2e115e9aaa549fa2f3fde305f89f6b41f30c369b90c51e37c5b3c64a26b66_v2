The network\ngambled that his show would be cheaper to produce than the scripted programs that characterize\nprime time. Of course, his program would probably also have lower ratings, but the trade-off was\nworthwhile given the lower program costs. What that decision ignored was the importance of\nthose scripted shows with their higher ratings to the local affiliates who get a share of the revenue\nfrom those shows. The lower ratings also hurt their revenue stream from both national and local\nadvertising. Even worse, the Leno show ended up being a weaker “lead-in” for the local stations’\n11:00 p.m. newscasts. So what seemed to be a savvy business decision played havoc with the\nbudgets of more than 200 affiliates and six months later the network moved Leno back to his\n11:30 p.m. slot. Even though the network made money by saving on production costs, it created\na firestorm of complains from affiliates who lost ratings and advertising revenues.24\nTheeconomicmodelofbroadcasttelevisionisgenerallybasedonanadvertising-supported\nmodel,atleastforthetraditionalnetworks.Themodelreliesonproducingprogramsthatattract\na large audience that advertisers want to reach.Advertising, plus revenue from the programs\nthat are syndicated after they go off air, has supported network TV since its beginnings, al-\nthoughthatmodelisinserioustroublewiththedevelopmentofcableandthesplinteringofthe\nviewingaudience.\nStructure of the Television Industry To better understand how television works, let’s first con-\nsider its structure and programming options.
