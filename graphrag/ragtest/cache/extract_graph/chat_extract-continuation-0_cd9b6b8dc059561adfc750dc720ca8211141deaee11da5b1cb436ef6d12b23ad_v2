This was partly because of an overall decline in media advertis-\ning but also because marketers were increasingly turning to the Internet for Outdoor Inserts\nvisibility at less cost. 2.5% 1.9%\nNewspapers were the biggest losers because of the shift of classified\nadvertising to online sites and the ease with which readers could get news Radio\nonline. Many major papers closed; others were reduced in size, staff, and 5.5%\nnews coverage. Magazines suffered, as well. Revenues for broadcast were Internet\ndown with traditional radio and television companies seeing red ink. The 7.2%\nbright spot during the recession was the cable television sector.Advertising\nAgereported at the end of 2009 that 11 of the top 100 media firms had filed\nfor bankruptcy during the year with print dominating the list.6 Newspapers\n13.8% Television\n52.6%\nKey Media Players\nIn terms of jobs and career opportunities in media, there are professionals Magazines\nwho both sell and buy media. It is important that you understand the differ- 16.6%\nence. First let’s look at the professionals who sell space or time in media.\n• Media salespeoplework for a specific vehicle, such as a magazine or\nlocal television station, with the objective of building the best possi-\nble argument to convince media planners to use the medium they rep- FIGURE 11.1\nresent. Amedia salesperson is responsible for assembling packets of The Media Landscape\ninformation, or sales kits,on the medium he or she represents, which\nSource:Kantar Media.

Currently media conglomerates prevail. CBS, for example, created a co-\nordinated ad-selling division, called CBS RIOT, which stands for radio, Internet, outdoor,\nand television. The new division was designed to serve primarily local markets and offers\ncross-media(also called multichannel) integrated deals. Disney is reorganizing its ad sales\nto deliver a similar cross-media ad sales program for its kids’media properties.7\n• Media repsorbrokersare people (or companies) who sell space (in print) and time (in\nbroadcast) for a variety of media. If an agency wants to buy space in all of the major news-\npapers in the West, for example, the agency’s buyer could contract with a media rep firm\nwhose sales rep and brokers handle national sales for all those newspapers. This allows the\nmedia buyer to place the buy with one order\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MICHAEL DATTOLICO<|>PERSON<|>Michael Dattolico is a designer who created Jeep graphics for a technology client and graduated from the advertising program at the University of Florida<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Florida is an educational institution where Michael Dattolico graduated from the advertising program<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELAINE WAGNER<|>PERSON<|>Elaine Wagner is a professor who nominated Michael Dattolico<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KANTAR MEDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kantar Media is a media research organization that monitors advertising expenditures<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CBS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CBS is a media conglomerate that created a coordinated ad-selling division called CBS RIOT<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISNEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Disney is a media company reorganizing its ad sales to deliver a cross-media ad sales program for its kids’ media properties<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHAEL DATTOLICO<|>UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA<|>Michael Dattolico graduated from the advertising program at the University of Florida<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHAEL DATTOLICO<|>ELAINE WAGNER<|>Elaine Wagner nominated Michael Dattolico<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CBS<|>DISNEY<|>Both CBS and Disney are media companies that are reorganizing their ad sales strategies to offer cross-media ad sales programs<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
