The reason for the higher reach (55 vs. 35) with plan B, even though it has fewer GRPs, is\nthat plan B has a much more diverse set of programs that attract a more diverse audience than\nPrinciple\nplan A. But because plan B has a higher reach, it also has a lower frequency.\nReach and frequency are\nIt is important to remember that GRPs are a combination of R (cid:5) F.

Because the waste coverage is elimi-\nnated, the TRPs are lower than the total audience GRPs. Targeted rating points are, like R&F, de-\ntermined by media usage research data, which is available from syndicated research services like\nMRI and from the major media vehicles themselves.\nTo illustrate the difference between HH GRPs and TRPs, we’ll use media plan A, shown pre-\nviously. As shown in Table 14.2, the first column is HH rating points, while the new second col-\numn shows targeted rating points, or the percent of homes reached that include a female, age\n25 to 49, with a college degree and an affinity for at least one outdoor sport. The insertions re-\nmain the same, but the TRPs are greatly reduced, as you can see when you multiply targeted\nratings by insertions. When the 80 TRPs are compared to the 208 HH GRPs, you can see that\n128GRPs (208 – 80 (cid:4)128) were of little or no value to a natural food brand. The less waste, the\nmore efficient the media plan.\nTable 14.2 Calculating TRPs for Plan A\nProgram HH Rating Targeted Rating Insertions TRPs Total TRPs\nSurvivor 6 3 8 24\nLost 7 3 8 24\nAmerican Idol 9 1 8 8\n24 4 3 8 24\nTotal 80\nAnotherreasontotightlydescribeatargetaudience,especiallyintermsoflifestyle,istotake\nadvantage of the many media vehicles—magazines, TV programs and channels, and special\nevents—thatconnectwithvarioustypesoflifestyles.Examplesofmediathatofferspecialinterest\ntopicsareRunnersWorld,whichfeaturestopicsofinteresttorunners;ThisOldHouse,theTVpro-\ngramthatdescribeshomeimprovementandremodeling;Selfmagazine,whichfocusesonhealth\nandfitness;andBudgetTravelforthoselookingforinterestingbuteconomicaltripsandvacations.\nWe’ve been discussing the basic steps in media planning. Let’s now consider the tools and\ntechniques of media strategy.\nCost Efficiency\nAs mentioned earlier, one way to compare budgets with the competition is called share of voice.It sets\nthe budget relative to your brand’s and your competitors’market share. For example, if your client has\na 40 percent share of the market, then you may decide to spend at a 40 percent share of voice in order\nto maintain your brand’s competitive position. To calculate this budget level, you need to find the to-\ntal ad spending in your category, as well as the share of market owned by your brand and your key\ncompetitors.7For example, if the category ad spending totals $10 million, and you want your share of\nvoice to be 40 percent, then you would need to spend $4 million ($10 million (cid:5)0.40(cid:4)$4 million).\nAt the end of the planning process, after the media mix has been determined, the media plan-\nner will prepare a pie chart showing media allocations,a term that refers to allocating the budget\namong the various media chosen.
