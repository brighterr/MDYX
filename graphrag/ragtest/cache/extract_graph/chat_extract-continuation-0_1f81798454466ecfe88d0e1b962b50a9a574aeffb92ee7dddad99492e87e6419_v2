An effective poster is built around\na creative concept that marries the words with the visual. For the Coffee Rush chain, Karl\nSchroeder created a series of posters to change consumers’perceptions that the shop was merely\na drive-through for fast, cheap coffee. Schroeder’s team did this by promoting a line of cold drinks\nwith captivating names such as Mango Guava and Wild Berry.\nOneofthemostfamousbillboardcampaignseverwasforalittleshavingcreamcompany\nnamedBurmaShave.Thecampaignusedaseriesofroadsidesignswithcatchy,cute,andsome-\ntimespoeticadvertisingcopyaimedatautotravelers.Some600poemswerefeaturedinthiscam-\npaign,whichranfornearly40years,from1925to1963,untilthenationalinterstatesystemand\nfastroadsmadethesignsobsolete.8(ToreadmoreaboutBurmaShave,gotowww.eisnermuseum.org/\n_burma_shave/signs_of_the_times.html or check the collection at www.sff.net/people/teaston/\nburma.htm.)OntheBurmaShavesignstheproductwasalwaysahero:\nIf you think My job is\nshe likes keeping faces clean\nyour bristles And nobody knows\nwalk bare-footed de stubble\nthrough some thistles I’ve seen\nBurma Shave Burma Shave\n274 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nSHOWCASE\nThese posters for the Coffee Rush group of small, drive-through coffee shops, told newcomers that Coffee Rush sold\nmore than just “a cup of joe.” The copy, which had to be simple to be read by people in a car, was designed to tease\npeople into tasting these fun drinks.\nThese posters were contributed by Karl Schroeder, a graduate of the University of Oregon\nand a copywriter at Coates Kokes in Portland, Oregon. He was nominated by Professor\nCharles Frazer, University of Oregon.\nMore recently, the city of Albuquerque used the Burma Shave format to encourage drivers\nto reduce their speeds through a construction zone. Today, a construction zone is about the only\nplace where traffic moves slowly enough to use a billboard with rhyming copy.\nThrough this maze of machines and rubble\nDriving fast can cause you trouble\nTake care and be alert\nSo no one on this road gets hurt.\nIn contrast to the Burma Shave signs, the most important characteristic of copywriting for\noutdoor advertising is brevity. Usually, a single line serves as both a headline and product identifi-\ncation. Often the phrase is a play on words. Aseries of black-and-white billboards in the Galveston-\nHouston area, recruiting priests for the Roman Catholic diocese, features a Roman collar with\nwitty wording such as “Yes, you will combat evil. No, you don’t get to wear a cape.” Othersare\nmore thoughtful: “Help wanted. Inquire within yourself.” Some experts suggest that billboard\ncopywriters use no more than six to seven words. The copy must catch attention and be memo-\nrable. For example, a billboard for Orkin pest control showed a package wrapped up with the\nword Orkin on the tag. The headline read, “Alittle something for your ant.”\nSometimes called collateral materials because they are used in support of an advertising\ncampaign, product literature—brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and other materials—provides de-\ntails about a product, company, or event. They can be as varied as hang tags in new cars or bumper\nstickers. Taco Bell’s little messages on its tiny taco sauce packages are an example of clever writ-\ning in an unexpected place with messages like: “Save a bun, eat a taco,” “Warning! You’re about\nto make a taco very happy,” and “My other taco is a chalupa.”\nTypically, product literatureis a heavy copy format, or at least a format that provides room\nfor explanatory details along with visuals; the body copy may dominate the piece. For a pam-\nphlet with folds, a writer must also consider how the message is conveyed as the piece is un-\nfolded. These pieces can range from a simple three-panel flyer to a glitzy multipage, full-color\nbrochure.\nCHAPTER 9 • COPYWRITING 275\nHOW IS COPY WRITTEN FOR RADIO?\nAdsthatarebroadcastoneitherradioortelevisionareusually15,30,or60secondsinlength,al-\nthough10-and15-secondspotsmaybeusedforbrandremindersorstationidentification.Thisshort\nlengthmeansthecommercial\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KARL SCHROEDER<|>PERSON<|>Karl Schroeder is a copywriter at Coates Kokes in Portland, Oregon, and a graduate of the University of Oregon.
