VALS also describes the communication styles of\neach VALS group so the advertiser can design ads using images and copy in a style that will\ngrab the target group’s attention. In addition, by using GeoVALS™, the advertiser can place\nthe ad where concentrations of the target live. In addition to the U.S. system, Japan-VALS™\nand UK-VALS™have also been developed.\nSociodemographic Segments One common approach to demographic segmentation that has en-\ntered mainstream vocabulary comes from referring to people in terms of when they were born.\nAlthough these categories are age driven and we discussed them in an earlier section, these mar-\nket segment terms also refer to lifestyle differences. We’ve talked about the incredible impact\nbaby boomers have had as a market category, so you can understand their importance as a mar-\nket segment, but savvy marketers recognize the many differences in lifestyles and attitudes\namong this huge population. Generations X and Y, as well as the echo boomers, are also impor-\ntant demographic segments, but their sociodemographic characteristics may represent more con-\nsistent lifestyle differences.\nSeniors are also referred to as the gray marketand divided into two categories: young sen-\niors (ages 60 to 74), called the Boomer-Plusgroup,34and older seniors (ages 75 and older). Se-\nniors, both younger and older, comprise a huge market, especially in the United States, and also\na wealthy one. As baby boomers move into their retirement years, this senior market will become\neven larger relative to the rest of the population.\nOther fun terms that have been used to describe demographic and lifestyle segments include\nthe following:\n• DinkiesDouble-income young couples with no kids\n• GuppiesGay upwardly mobile professionals\n• SkippiesSchool kids with purchasing power\n• SlackersArecycled term inspired by the 1991 movie Slacker,referring to teenagers and\nyoung adults who don’t care much or do much\n• Bling-Bling GenerationAterm coined by rappers and hip hoppers referring to people with\na high-rolling lifestyle who flash costly jewelry\n• RuppiesRetired urban professionals; older consumers with sophisticated tastes and gener-\nally affluent lifestyles.\nBehavior\nThe behavioral component of the think/feel/do model that we discussed in Chapter 4 is a key\nstrategic factor used in describing the relationship consumers have with a product category or a\nbrand. That behavioral component, particularly product usage, is often used in segmenting con-\nsumers. Arecent behavioral economics study in Sacramento, California, found that when people\nwere told how much their neighbors save on their electrical bills, this comparative information\nmotivated them to reduce their energy use as well.35\nBehavior, however, is often a product of feelings (impulse) or thoughtful search.
