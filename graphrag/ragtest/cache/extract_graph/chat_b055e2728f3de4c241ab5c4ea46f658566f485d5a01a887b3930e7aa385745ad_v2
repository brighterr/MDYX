This chapter is about the visuals used\nin advertising—how they are designed and what they con-\ntribute to the meaning of the ad. First we review some basic\nideas about visual impact, both in print and broadcast, and the\nrole of the art director. Then we consider print art production\nand video production and end with a discussion of the design\nof Internet advertising.\nWHY IS VISUAL COMMUNICATION\nIMPORTANT?\nWhat makes Altoids so visually remarkable? Does the prod-\nuct grab your attention? How does the visual build brand per-\nsonality? Is it interesting? Do you remember it?\nThe success of Altoids breath mints is primarily a result\nof the consistent graphic presentation of the brand in its mar-\nketing communication. The visual consistency is not only ap-\nparent in the design of the package and the ads; it also reflects\nthe history of the brand as a quirky old British lozenge.\nThe Altoids ads use association to create curiosity, but\nalso to reflect the meaning of the slogan. “Nice Altoids”\nbuilds on a unique connection between the sound of “del-\nThis ad offers a visual pun, playing on the product name\ntoids” and the brand name. We’ve also reproduced an ad used\nand the slang “nice ‘toids.” Pairing the unexpected—the\nhunk’s deltoid muscles and the product—helps create a to launch the Altoids Cinnamon line, which continues to\nmemorable association. build on the brand position but modifies it slightly to read\nCHAPTER 10 • VISUAL COMMUNICATION 291\n“curiously hot” rather than “curiously strong.” Afirewalker\ntiptoeing across a patch of the little white mints visually re-\ninforces a truth about the product—the Cinnamon Altoids\nare hot enough to tickle your toes.\nIn effective advertising, both print and television, it’s\nnot just the words that need to communicate the message—\nthe visuals need to communicate, too. The visuals normally\nwork with the words to present the creative concept. An ex-\nample of a simple story told totally through the visuals is\nthe Best of Show award for a One Show competition that\nshowcased a British campaign for Volkswagen. It featured\na gently humorous 30-second commercial built around the\nlow price of the VWPolo. Bob Barrie, when he was presi-\ndent of The One Club, an association for people in the cre-\native side of advertising, explained that it was possibly the\nquietest, most understated TVspot entered in the show. The\nidea was simple: A woman sits at her kitchen table. Her\nscanning of the newspaper—and her hiccups—stop\nabruptly as she discovers an ad for the VW Polo with its\n“surprisingly ordinary” price.1\nVisuals do some things better than words, such as\ndemonstrate something. How would you demonstrate, for\nexample, the smallness of a computer chip or a new minia-\nture hard drive? IBM did it through a visual analogy—\nshowing its hard disk drive inside half an eggshell next to a\nnewborn chick.\nEven radio can evoke mental pictures through sugges-\ntive or descriptive language and sound effects.
