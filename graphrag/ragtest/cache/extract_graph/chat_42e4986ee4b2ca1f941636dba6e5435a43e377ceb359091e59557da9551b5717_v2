The part of brand equity that is\nbased on relationships is also referred to as goodwill. It lies in the accumulation of\npositive brand relationships, which can be measured as a level of personal attach-\nment to the brand that has revenue-producing potential.\nLeveraging Brand Equity Brand managers will sometimes leverage brand equity\nthrough a brand extension, which is the use of an established brand name with a re-\nlated line of products.
