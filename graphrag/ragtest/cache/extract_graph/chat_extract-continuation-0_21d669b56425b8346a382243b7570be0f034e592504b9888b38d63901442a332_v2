Of course, historical stories need period costumes, but modern scenes\nmay also require special clothing such as golf outfits, swimsuits, or cowboy boots. Makeup may\nbe important if you need to change a character from young to old. The copywriter must specify\nall of these details in the script. The director usually manipulates the lighting, but the copywriter\nmight specify special lighting effects in the script. For example, you might read “Intense bright\nCHAPTER 9 • COPYWRITING 281\nlight as though reflected from snow” or “Light flickering on people’s faces as if reflecting from\na television screen.”\nCopywriters might also have to specify the commercial’s pace—how fast or slowly the ac-\ntion progresses. Some messages are best developed at a languid pace; others work better when\npresented at an upbeat, fast pace. Research has found that the pace of TVcommercials has been\nsteadily getting faster since the mid-20th century. Why do you suppose that might be?\nPlanning the TV Commercial\nCopywriters must plan how long the commercial will be, what shots will appear in each scene, what\nthe key visual will be, and where and how to shoot the commercial. Other key decisions the copy-\nwriter must consider in planning a commercial are the length, number of scenes, and key frames.\nThe common lengths of TV commercials are 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 seconds. The 10-, 15-, and\n20-second lengths are used for reminders and product or station identification. The 60-second spot,\nwhich is common in radio, has almost disappeared in television because of the increasing cost of\nairtime. The most common length for a TVcommercial is 30 seconds.\nScenes and Key Frames Acommercial is planned in scenes—segments of action that occur in\na single location. Ascene may include several shots from different angles. A30-second commer-\ncial usually is planned with four to six scenes, but a fast-paced commercial may have many more.\nBecause television is a visual medium, the message is often developed as a key visualthat con-\nveys the heart of the concept. The key frameis the shot that sticks in the mind and becomes the\nimage viewers remember when they think about the commercial. Copywriter Lara Mann de-\nscribes a campaign she worked on for the Florida Film Festival. The campaign used television\ncommercials but they were supported by posters with key frames from the commercials. The TV\ntagline “Where Will It Take You?” appears on the posters to express the thought that the Film Fes-\ntival takes you to some exotic locations.\nCopywriters need to answer many questions when planning a television spot. How much\nproduct information should there be in the commercial? Should the action be fast or slow? Is it\nwise to defy tradition and create unusual, even controversial ads as Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky did\nwith Old Navy’s SuperModelquins? How intrusive should the ad be?\nEvery producer and director will respond to these questions differently, depending on per-\nsonal preferences and the advertising objectives. Nevertheless, these general principles as out-\nlined by Drewniany and Jewler in their creative strategy book and earlier editions of their book\nare relevant for most effective television commercials:11\n• What’s the big ideayou need to get across? In 30 seconds you barely have time to do much\nmore than that. Alternative concepts are also tested as key visuals in developing the idea for the\ncommercial. For each idea, a card with the key visual drawn on it is given to a respondent, along\nwith a paragraph that describes the concept and how it will be played out in the commercial.\n• What’s the benefitof that big idea, and who does it benefit? Connect the big idea back to the\ntarget audience.\n• Howcanyouturnthatbenefitintoavisualelement?Thisvisualiswhatsticksinpeo-\nple’sminds.\n• Howcanyougaintheinterestofviewersatthebeginning?Thefirstthreesecondsare\ncritical.\n• How can you focus on a key visual,a scene that encapsulates your entire selling message\ninto one neat package?\n• Is the commercial single-minded?Tell one important story per commercial. Tell it clearly,\ntell it memorably, and involve your viewer.\n• Is the product identified and shownin close-up at the end?\nScripts, Storyboards, and Photoboards Two documents are used to plan commercials: a television\nscript prepared by the copywriter and a storyboard drawn by the art director. Similar to a radio script,\natelevision scriptis the written version of the commercial’s plan. It contains all the words, dialogue,\nlyrics (if important to the ad message), instructions, and descriptions of the details we’ve been\ndiscussing—sets, costumes, lighting, and so forth. For television commercials that use dialogue, the\nscript is written in two columns, with the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CATHERINE ZETA-JONES<|>PERSON<|>Catherine Zeta-Jones is a celebrity mentioned as an example of talent used in commercials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK EYED PEAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Black Eyed Peas is a music group mentioned as an example of talent used in commercials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEICO GECKO<|>PERSON<|>The Geico Gecko is a fictional character used as a spokesperson in commercials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRONTIER TALKING ANIMALS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Frontier Talking Animals are fictional characters used as spokespersons in commercials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLORIDA FILM FESTIVAL<|>EVENT<|>The Florida Film Festival is an event that used television commercials and posters for promotion)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATHERINE ZETA-JONES<|>BLACK EYED PEAS<|>Both Catherine Zeta-Jones and the Black Eyed Peas are examples of celebrities used in commercials<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEICO GECKO<|>FRONTIER TALKING ANIMALS<|>Both the Geico Gecko and Frontier Talking Animals are examples of fictional spokespersons used in commercials<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLORIDA FILM FESTIVAL<|>BLACK EYED PEAS<|>The Florida Film Festival used television commercials, a medium where the Black Eyed Peas are mentioned as talent<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLORIDA FILM FESTIVAL<|>CATHERINE ZETA-JONES<|>The Florida Film Festival used television commercials, a medium where Catherine Zeta-Jones is mentioned as talent<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
