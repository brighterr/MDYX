One technology involves a set-\ntop box, and 3-D sets are being tested by Japanese and Korean electronics rivals; Sony and ESPN\nare particularly focused on this new market.28British Sky Broadcasting is proposing a special 3-D\ntelevision channel that will provide content for these new sets. In the United States several 2010\nSuper Bowl ads were filmed in 3-D. The logistics are difficult but 3-D may finally be on its way\nto home television sets.\n378 PART 4 â€¢ PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nTraditional forms of network television are being threatened\nbyonline video.After Comcast bid to buy NBC, one of the ideas\nfloated by the new management team involved subscription fees\nfor NBCâ€”hoping to make the previously ad-supported network\nmore like premium cable. The new combined media and enter-\ntainment company also considered bringing the cable-TV sub-\nscription model to the Web and its online video programming.29\nAnother technology that is having a profound effect on tele-\nvision programming and the way people watch television is the\ndigital video recorder (DVR),such as TiVo. DVR systems allow\nusers to record favorite TVshows and watch them whenever they\nlike. The technology makes it possible to record the programming\nwithout the hassles of videotape, letting users pause, do instant re-\nplays, and begin watching programs even before the recording has\nfinished. This capability is known as time-shifting.\nDVRs are a threat to marketers because it allows consumers\nto zip past commercials completely. It also is forcing advertisers to\nrethink the design of their ads, recognizing that they have 3 to\n4 seconds, at best, to win the attention of button-happy viewers. It\nalso raises the issue of how advertisers should respond. Some are\nexperimenting with new ways to send messages that immediately\nengage attention. Coca-Cola and TiVo, for example, have created\nads that appear on screen as a small text box when viewers pause\na show.30\nAdvertisers and television executives are alarmed over the\nincreasing popularity of time-shifting technology. It calls into\nDVR technology poses a challenge for advertisers questionaudiencemeasurementnumbers:If20percentoftheau-\nsince it enables consumers to bypass commercials. dienceisrecording24onMondaynightonlytowatchitSaturday\nmorningcommercialfree,thenistheMondaynightmeasurement\naccurate?TheDVRindustryestimatesthatviewerszippast(fastforwardthrough)about6per-\ncentofTVcommercialsâ€”anestimatedwasteofsome$5billioninadspendingâ€”andpredictsthat\nbytheendof2011,about16percentwillsufferthatfate.31\nANielsen study, however, found that viewers are not zipping through commercials as much\nas advertisers feared. To further understand this pattern, TiVo has also announced that it is con-\nsidering a service that will provide second-by-second data about which programs the companyâ€™s\nsubscribers are watching and which commercials they are skipping.\nMeasuring the Television Audience Agreat number of advertisers consider television their pri-\nmary medium. Can television deliver a target audience to advertisers effectively? What do we re-\nally know about how audiences watch television? Is it a background distraction? Do we switch\nfrom channel to channel without watching any single show? Or do we carefully and intelligently\nselect what we watch on television?\nPrinciple Television viewers are sometimes irritated by the intrusiveness of advertising and are not re-\nThe TV audience has luctant to switch channels or zip through commercials on prerecorded programs. Clutter is part\nbecome very good at of the problem advertisers face and the audience has become very good at avoidance, unless the\navoiding commercials ads are intrusive or highly engaging. The Super Bowl is one of the few programs where viewers\nunless the ads are actually watch commercials. Nielsen has found that the average drop in viewing between the\nintrusive or highly\ngame and the commercials was less than 1 percent. CBS says that the typical drop during a nor-\nengaging. mal program is approximately 5 percent.32\nA. C. Nielsen is the research company that dominates the television measurement industry.\nExposure is televisionâ€™s equivalent to circulation. Exposure measures households with sets\nturned on, a population referred to as households using television (HUT). But a HUT figure\ndoesnâ€™t tell you if anyone is watching the program. Remember from Chapter 11that we defined\nanimpressionas one personâ€™s opportunity to be exposed one time to an ad.
