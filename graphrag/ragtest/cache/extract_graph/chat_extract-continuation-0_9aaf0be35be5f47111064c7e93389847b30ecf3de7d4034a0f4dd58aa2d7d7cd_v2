Supplanted by the Food, Drug\nand Cosmetic Act of 1938; amended by Food Additives Amendment in 1958 and\nKefauver-Harris Amendment in 1962.\n• Federal Trade Commission Act (1914)Establishes the commission, a body of specialists\nwith broad powers to investigate and to issue cease-and-desist orders to enforce Section 5,\nwhich declares that “unfair methods of competition in commerce are unlawful.”\n• Wheeler-LeaAmendment(1938)Prohibitsunfairanddeceptiveactsandpracticesregardlessof\nwhethercompetitionisinjured;placesadvertisingoffoodsanddrugsunderFTCjurisdiction.\n• Lanham Act (1947)Provides protection for trademarks (slogans and brand names) from\ncompetitors and also encompasses false advertising.\n• Magnuson-Moss Warranty/FTC Improvement Act (1975)Authorizes the FTC to determine\nrules concerning consumer warranties and provides for consumer access to means of redress,\nsuch as the “class action” suit. Also expands FTC regulatory powers over unfair or deceptive\nacts or practices and allows it to require restitution for deceptively written warranties costing\nthe consumer more than $5.\n• FTC Improvement Act (1980)Provides the House of Representatives and Senate jointly\nwith veto power over FTC regulation rules. Enacted to limit the FTC’s powers to regulate\n“unfairness” issues in designing trade regulation rules on advertising.\n82 PART 1 • ENDURING PRINCIPLES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\n• The Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud Act and Abuse Protection Act (1994)Specifies\nthat telemarketers may not call anyone who requests not to be contacted. Resulted in the\nTelemarketing Sales Rules.\nIn this section, we examine two pivotal areas of case law—trademarks and copyright pro-\ntection and the First Amendment—as they pertain to advertising and other areas of marketing\ncommunication.\nTrademark and Copyright Protection Atrademarkis a brand, corporate or store name, or dis-\ntinctive symbol that identifies the seller’s brand and thus differentiates it from the brands of other\nsellers. Atrademark can be registered through the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) of the De-\npartment of Commerce, which gives the organization exclusive use of the mark, as long as the\ntrademark is maintained as an identification of a specific product. Registered trademarks enjoy\nmore legal protection than those that are not registered. Under the Lanham Trademark Act of\n1947, the PTO protects unique trademarks from infringement by competitors.\nEven an audio trademark is protected, as a case in the European Union (EU) illustrates. A\ndistinctive audio sound based on the noise of a cock crowing and the way it was represented in\nDutch had been registered with the EU’s trademark office. When this sound trademark was used\nby a different company, the first company sued\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RALPH B.
