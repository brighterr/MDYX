The nature of creative ideas has changed with the\ndevelopment of new, more engaging media. For example, you may remember that in Chapter 6\nwe introduced the Icelandic lamb case study.

As Sasser explains, advertising agencies\nrepresent the perfect “think tank” to inspire creativity and research into creative thinking. Her re-\nsearch has found that agencies are natural incubators in terms of the 3 Ps of innovation: Place,\nPerson, and Process. She explains these themes as follows:\n• PlaceEnvironment research focuses on areas of the agency, office, or workspace setting that\nimpact on creativity, such as image, structure, culture, integration, and communication.
