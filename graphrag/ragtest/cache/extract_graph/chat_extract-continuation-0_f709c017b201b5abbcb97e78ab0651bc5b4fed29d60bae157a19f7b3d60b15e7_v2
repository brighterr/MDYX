Amazon.com’s\nwebsite, for example, contains complete information about the product offerings, such as book\nreviews, as well as a way to place an order, pay for it, and contact customer service if there is a\nproblem. The website operates like a direct-mail catalog, but interactivity makes it even more use-\nful than a print version can be. Customers can make inquiries and the company can use its data-\nbases to personalize customer communication.\nEven though some issued warnings early on about how the Internet would kill off catalogs,\nPrinciple\nin fact they are increasing in number. The reason—lasting impressions—is that most people hang\nThe reason the catalog\nindustry is growing is onto catalogs for weeks, giving them a longevity that beats all other media except, perhaps, for\nbecause catalogs deliver a magazines. As technology has improved, catalog marketers have refined their databases and\nlasting impression. culled consumers who receive catalogs but don’t order from them.\nAnother factor in the effectiveness of catalogs is the nature of the interactions between cus-\ntomers and the company, whether over the phone or the Internet. Lands’End has been a model of\ncustomer care that leads not just to brand loyalty, but also brand love. Lands’End has been rec-\nognized for doing things like marshalling a corps of some 200 employee volunteers who respond\nto customer mail. The company has even been known to replace products before the customers\ndiscover they are faulty. Jeanne Bliss, chief customer officer at Lands’End, who helped create\nthis culture of customer care explains that this high-touch approach has won Lands’End a lot of\nlove, a point she writes about in her book, I Love You More Than My Dog.9\nSome catalog retailers have their own stores, such as title nine, Williams-Sonoma and\nTiffany’s. Banana Republic, which began as a catalog marketer and then moved into retailing, is\nnow launching its first catalog since 1988. Many large retailers are now multichannel, using cat-\nalogs, websites, and stores. Some marketers, such as L.L.Bean, have also seen their catalog mail-\nCHAPTER 16 • DIRECT RESPONSE 499\nNote how the catalog and web page work to build the brand for title nine\nthrough a consistent visual look and brand personality.\nings drive business to their websites. Bean expects that its online sales will soon overtake its cat-\nalog business, but it will still send out catalogs as a way to generate online sales. The advantages\nand limitations of marketing communication via catalogs are listed here:\nAdvantages and Limitations of Catalogs\nAdvantages Description\nTargeted Can be directed at specific market segments.\nEngages attention Employs high-quality design and photography\nComplete information Extensive product information and comparisons are provided.\nConvenience Offer a variety of purchase options.\nLimitations Description\nNegative perceptions Catalogs are viewed as junk mail by many recipients.\nCosts The cost per thousand catalogs is higher than that for mass media.\nResponse rate The response is relatively low at 3 to 4 percent.\nMailing list Databases must be constantly maintained.\nAnumber of marketers are using video or CD catalogs because these provide more infor-\nmation about their products. Car companies, for example, use online catalogs or CDs. The mes-\nsage can be interactive and feature animated illustrations. The catalog presents graphic\ndescriptions and detailed text on the current models, including complete specifications. With\nsome, you can even custom design your dream car.\nTelemarketing\nBefore telemarketing calls were greatly limited by government-supported do-not-call lists, more\ndirect marketing dollars were spent on telemarketing phone calls than on any other DMC\n500 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nSHOWCASE\nThis is a CD cover designed by Michael Dattolico\nfor his client Microflex, a B2B company in the\nautomotive industry.\nOwner of his own design studio, Musion\nCreative, LLC (www.musioncreative.com),\nMichael Dattolico graduated from the\nadvertising program at the\nUniversity of Florida where he\nwas a student of Professor\nElaine Wagner.\nmedium. That’s because telemarketing is a form of personal sales, but a lot less expensive. An in-\nperson sales call may cost anywhere from $50 to $1,000 after factoring in time and transporta-\ntion. In comparison, a telephone call ranges from $2 to $15 per call. That is still expensive if you\ncompare it to the CPM of an advertisement placed in any one of the mass media ($10 to $50 per\nthousand); however, the returns are much higher than those generated by mass advertising be-\ncause they are intrusive, personalized, and interactive.
