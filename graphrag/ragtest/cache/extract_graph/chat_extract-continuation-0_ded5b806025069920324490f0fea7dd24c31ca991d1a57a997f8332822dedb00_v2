Sales promotion works for\nall kinds of businesses, including movies as The Inside Story\nyou’ll read later in the chapter illustrates. Here’s a summary of the\nmost common types of consumer promotions.\n• Price DealsApopular sales promotion technique is a price\ndeal,a temporary price reduction or a sale price, or even free-\nbies.Giveawaysof some books, usually those that are in the\npublic domain, such as Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice,\nwere used by Amazon.comto promote its Kindle e-reader.6\nAmazon also sometimes gives away limited numbers of cer-\ntain new titles to spark interest in a new book. The Billings,\nMontana, “Trailhead” branding campaign that we discussed\nin Chapter 7also used a giveaway to build excitement for the\nnew brand identity.\nFreebies can be a killer if the company doesn’t adequately\npredict the consumer response. That happened to KFC when it in-\ntroduced its new grilled chicken. In what it thought was a great\nidea, the KFC promotion team got Oprah to announce a deal for\nfreebie meals. Unfortunately, KFC wasn’t prepared for the enor-\nmous response and its stores ran out of food, angering millions of\ncustomers. Next it tried to make good on its giveaway with down-\nloadable coupons from its website, but because of problems on-\nline, many customers gave up on that offer as well. Even with all\nthe bad press, the KFC president found a silver lining: “There’s no\none in America right now who doesn’t know we’re selling grilled\nchicken,” he said.7\nThe four common price deals include:\n1. Acents-off dealis a reduction in the normal price charged\nfor a good or service (for example, “was $1,000, now\n$500,” or “50 percent off”) announced at the point of sale or\nthrough mass or direct advertising.\n2. Prize-pack dealsprovide the consumer with something ex-\ntra through the package itself—a prize in a cereal box, for\ninstance.\n3. Bonus packscontain additional amounts of the product free\nwhen consumers purchase the standard size at the regular\nprice. For example, Purina Dog Food may offer 25 percent\nmore dog food in the bag.\nSHOWCASE\n4. Banded packsare more units of a product sold at a lower\nThe Billings “Trailhead” campaign used weekly drawings\nprice than if they were bought at the regular single-unit\nwith the winners receiving caps, as well as dinner and two\nprice.

Sometimes the refund is a check for a\ncertain amount of money; at other times it may be a coupon to encourage repeat use.\n• SamplingAllowingtheconsumertotrytheproductorserviceiscalledsampling.Advertis-\nerscandistributesamplestoconsumersinnumerousways.Samplingtables,particularlyfor\nfoodproducts,canbesetupinstores.Smallsamplesofproductscanshowupwithnews-\npapersandonhousedoorknobs,indoctors’anddentists’offices,and,mostcommonly,\nthroughthemail.AninterestingofferbyMillstoneCoffeeinvolvedanemptybagdelivered\nwithanewspaperinthenewspaper’splasticbagthatcouldbetakentothestoreandfilled\nwithahalf-poundMillstonesampleoftheirchoice.Advertiserscandesignadswithcoupons\nforfreesamples,placesamplesinspecialpackages,ordistributesamplesatspecialin-store\ndisplays.Productsamplesinfluenceconsumersmorethanothertypesofin-storepromo-\ntions,accordingtoonesurvey.\nSampling is not just an in-store activity. Consider car rentals. AWashington Post\ncolumnist took automakers to task for selling low-budget, stripped down models to car\nrental companies. His point was that car rentals are an unrecognized sampling opportunity\nand if the experience is uncomfortable or the performance is underwhelming, then the car\nmaker has suffered a possibly fatal hit to its brand experience. His point: it would make\nmore sense for an automobile manufacturer to display the best samples of its cars in the\nrental market, even if that means selling them to rental car companies at a loss.9\nSampling has also become a mainstay of interactive promotions on the Internet. Some\ncompanies sample their products on their Web page.10Recently, Dove enticed customers\nwith free samples of its new\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON.COM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amazon.com is an online retail giant known for selling a wide range of products, including books and e-readers like the Kindle)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KFC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>KFC is a fast-food restaurant chain known for its fried chicken, which launched a grilled chicken promotion that led to a significant consumer response)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPRAH<|>PERSON<|>Oprah is a well-known media personality who announced a KFC promotion for free meals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILLINGS<|>GEO<|>Billings is a city in Montana that launched the \"Trailhead\" branding campaign to promote its new brand identity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CROWNE PLAZA HOTEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crowne Plaza Hotel is a hotel chain that was part of the grand prize in the Billings \"Trailhead\" campaign)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN BREWER<|>PERSON<|>John Brewer is the president and CEO of the Billings Chamber of Commerce/Convention & Visitors Bureau)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALMART<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Walmart is a multinational retail corporation that engaged in a price war with Amazon over hardback book prices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILLSTONE COFFEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Millstone Coffee is a coffee brand that offered a unique sampling promotion involving an empty bag for consumers to fill with a sample of their choice)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMAZON.COM<|>WALMART<|>Amazon.com and Walmart engaged in a price war over hardback book prices, each trying to undercut the other<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KFC<|>OPRAH<|>Oprah announced a KFC promotion for free meals, leading to a massive consumer response<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BILLINGS<|>CROWNE PLAZA HOTEL<|>The Crowne Plaza Hotel was part of the grand prize in the Billings \"Trailhead\" campaign<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHN BREWER<|>BILLINGS<|>John Brewer is the president and CEO of the Billings Chamber of Commerce/Convention & Visitors Bureau<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
