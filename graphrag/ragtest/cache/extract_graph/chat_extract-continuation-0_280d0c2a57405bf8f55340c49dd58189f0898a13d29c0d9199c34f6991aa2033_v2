That ongoing, multichannel, multi-\nplatform, multistakeholder approach to the practice of IMC is what we have been referring to in\nprevious chapters when we have described the principles and practices of IMC. We also added\ntwo more in the previous discussion, so we now have a set of ten principles of IMC.\nLet’s summarize this total brand communication philosophy by compiling the complete set\nof IMC principles that we have developed in this book. The 10 basic principles that we believe\nguide IMC practices are shown in Table 18.2. These are a manager’s toolkit to guide the design\nof a 360-degree brand communication program.\nAs we said at the beginning of this chapter, a number of different marketing communication\nsituations can benefit from an IMC approach. Let’s now consider the practice of our first specialty\narea—retail marketing.\nTable 18.2 Ten Principles of IMC\nFirst Principle of IMC Everything communicates.\nEverything in the marketing mix sends a message. Everything a brand does, and sometimes\nwhat it doesn’t do, can send a message. One cannot NOT communicate. Receiving messages\nis as important as sending messages. Integrating the marketing communication is futile if\ncontrary and more powerful messages are being sent by other brand actions.\nSecond Principle A brand is a unified vision (the art) and a complex system (the science).\nThird Principle Brand relationships drive brand value.\nInteractivity leads to brand involvement. When two parties interact, both learn about the other.\nCustomer retention is just as important as customer acquisition.\nFourth Principle Integration equals integrity.\nMission marketing adds trust to brand relationships.\nFifth Principle People automatically integrate brand messages and experiences.\nSynergy occurs when all the messages work together to create a coherent brand perception.\nSixth Principle Stakeholders overlap.\nSeventh Principle All contact points deliver brand messages.\nEverything that delivers a message to a stakeholder about a brand is a contact point. Both\ngood and bad. Maximize and leverage the good ones and minimize the bad ones.\nEighth Principle Strategic consistency drives synergy.\nAt every point of contact with every stakeholder, the essence of the brand should be the same.\nStrategic consistency, rather than one-look, one-voice executions, drives synergy.\nNinth Principle You can’t be integrated externally if you are not integrated internally.\nA core brand strategy—a shared vision—drives the entire organization. Cross-functional\norganization delivers unity of vision, and unity of vision drives an integrated brand perception.\nTenth Principle Integration happens when what your brand says matches what it does and\nwhat others say about it.\nA brand fails as an integrated perception if there are gaps between say, do, and confirm brand\ncommunication.\nRETAIL MARKETING COMMUNICATION\nThefaceofretailingischangingasmallsconverttoopen-airmarkets,eBayoperatesaninterna-\ntionalfleamarket,andtheInternetbecomesaprimaryinformationsourceforbuyers.Clicksand\nbricksarechangingplacesasstore-basedretailers(bricks)setupwebsitesande-marketers(clicks)\nsetupstores.NikeTownstoressellsportsasentertainmentandESPNtakestheXGamestomalls.\nThemoretheretailworldchanges,themoreneedthereisforinformationandpromotion.\nCHAPTER 18 • THE IMC UMBRELLA 551\nAsignificant part of the U.S. economy, big\nstores such as Walmart, Target, Kohl’s, Sears,\nand JCPenney, accounts for more than 10 per-\ncent of all U.S. consumer goods spending. Ac-\ncording to branding consulting firm Interbrand,\nthe three most valuable retail brands in the\nUnited States are Walmart with a brand value\nestimated at $154 billion. Target is second at\n$25.5 billion, and Best Buy is third at $17.8 bil-\nlion. Others in the top 10 were Home Depot,\nWalgreens, CVS, Sam’s Club, Dell, Coach, and\nAmazon.com.8\nIn some estimates, retail accounts for\nnearly half of all the money spent on advertis-\ning. Retail marketing communication has two\nmissions: (1) selling the brand of the retail store,\nas the Saks ad demonstrates, and (2) selling in-\ndividual branded items the store carries. Best\nA positive, distinctive image is a valuable asset and especially\nBuy, for example, uses marketing communica- important for upscale retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue. This visual shows\ntion to promote itself as these ads demonstrate, both a thumbnail and the produced ad. What do you think this ad says\nbut it also sells a variety of electronics brands— about the image of Saks?\neverything from Adobe to Yamaha with hun-\ndreds of brands in between. Increasingly, retail\nfood and drug chains are giving more space and promotional support to their own store brands,\nalso called private-label brandsorhouse brands.\nThe three basic types of retail stores are those that are independently ownedsuch as a barber\nshop, those that are part of a franchisesuch as KFC and Hertz, and those that are owned by a ma-\njorcorporationsuch as Starbucks and Macy’s.
