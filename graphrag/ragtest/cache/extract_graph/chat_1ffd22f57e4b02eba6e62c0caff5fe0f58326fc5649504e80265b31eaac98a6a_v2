Does creativity have anything to do with your personality? Your personal-\nity is your own distinctive and consistent pattern of how you think, feel, and act. You may not be a creative genius but\nstill you may have creative abilities that can be nurtured and developed.\nA current view of creativity suggests that the area of personality most related to creativity is how open you are to new\nexperiences. According to researchers, how open you are to new experiences can be measured by survey questions that\nask if you agree or disagree with statements like the following:\n1. “I enjoy working on mind-twister-type puzzles.”\n2. “Once I find the right way to do something, I stick to it.”\n3. “As a child I rarely enjoyed games of make-believe.”\n4. “I enjoy concentrating on a fantasy or daydream and exploring all its possibilities, letting it grow and develop.”\nWhich ones do you believe may predict a creative personality? Explain why. What can you do to expand your talents in\nthose areas?\nFIGURE 8.2\nThe Creative Personality\nSource:Sheri J.

It will help you understand how you\ncan be a more creative problem solver.\nThe Creative Brief\nThe art and science of advertising come together in the phrase creative strategy. Awinning mar-\nketing communication idea must be both creative (original, different, novel, unexpected) and\nstrategic(right for the product and target; meets the objectives). It’s not just about coming up with\na novel idea that no one has thought of before, but rather advertising creativity is about coming\nup with an idea that solves a communication problem in an original way.\nTheRoad Crew social marketing campaignis an example of creative problem solving for a\ngood cause. We’ll be using the Road Crew campaign throughout this chapter to illustrate differ-\nent aspects of message strategy. The problem was to get young men in Wisconsin small towns\nwho drink and drive to use a ride service. The objective was to reduce the incidence of alcohol-\nrelated car crashes by 5 percent. The breakthrough creative concept was to use the idea of a road\ncrew for a group of young partiers who needed a ride on their big night out.\nPeople who create advertisements also make a distinction between creative strategy and cre-\native executions. Creative strategy, or message strategy, is what the advertisement says;\nexecutionishowit is said. This chapter focuses on creative strategy, and the two chapters that\nfollow explore the writing, design, and production of advertising executions.\nThe creative strategy and the key execution details are spelled out in a document called a\ncreative brief(orcreative platform,worksheet,orblueprint).The brief is the document prepared\nby the account planner to summarize the basic marketing and advertising strategy that we briefly\nintroduced in Chapter 7. It gives direction to creative team members as they search for a creative\nconcept. The following outline summarizes the key points in a typical brief:\n• Problemthat can be solved by communication\n• Target audienceand key insightsinto their attitudes and behavior\n• Brand positionand other branding decisions, such as personalityandimage\n• Communicationobjectivesthatspecifythedesiredresponsetothemessagebythetarget\naudience\n• Propositionorselling ideathat will motivate the target to respond\n• Media considerationsabout where and when the message should be delivered\n• Creative directionthat provides suggestions on how to stimulate the desired consumer re-\nsponse. These aren’t creative ideas but may touch on such execution or stylistic direction as\nthe ad’s tone of voice.\nDifferent agencies use different formats, but most combine these basic advertising strategy\ndecisions. The briefs typically are in outline form, to be filled in by account planners and given\nto the creative team. The point is that advertising planning—even planning for the creative side—\ninvolves a structured, logical approach to analysis, which may leave out the intuitive, emotional\nmessage effects. The Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky agency, for example, designs its advertising by\nlooking for what it calls “tension points.” Its brief asks planners to consider: “What is the psy-\nchological, social, categorical, or cultural tension associated with this idea?”\nTheRoadCrewcampaignplanningbeganwithacreativebrief.Theultimategoalwasto\nencourageguyswholiketopartyandvisitbarstorelyonalimousinerideserviceratherthan\ntrying to drive home themselves. Here is the creative brief that shows the thinking behind the\ncampaign:\n• Why are we advertising at all?To create awareness for an evening alternative ride service.\n• What is the message trying to do?Make the new ride service appealing to men in order to\nreduce the number of alcohol-related crashes.\n• What are their current attitudes and perceptions?“My car is here right now.
