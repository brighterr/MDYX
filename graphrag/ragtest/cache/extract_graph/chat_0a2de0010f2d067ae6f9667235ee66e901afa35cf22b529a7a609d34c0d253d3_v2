A lot of clients are only as happy as their latest advertising campaign results.\nHaving taken the Honda CR-V from being a distant fourth as the most sold\nsmall SUV in Iceland to a close second with a successful marketing campaign, what\ncan you do to top the results? You make it the number one selling small SUV in the\ncountry.\nThe Honda dealership in Iceland challenged us to make the new-from-the-\nground-up CR-V the best selling small SUV in Iceland. Like most new car models,\nthe new CR-V was more luxurious and more expensive than its predecessor. To\nmeet the challenge of becoming number one, the new CR-V was completely\nchanged visually to cast a less rugged and more urban image.\nThe Icelandic climate, road conditions, and mentality have always inflated the\nneed for four-wheel-drive vehicles. Much like in the United States, the better per-\nformance of four-wheel-drive vehicles has increased the demand for such vehicles\nin the last decade and a half. Close to half the vehicles sold in Iceland were four-\nwheel drive, but the majority of those were full-size SUVs or pickups.\nMost ads for the SUV segment focused on off-road capabilities and mountain\nactivities. Our earlier research showed that the people buying those types of vehi-\ncles were not necessarily involved in those activities. Rather, we found that what\npeople wanted from those cars was mostly space, both for people and stuff (gro-\nceries, luggage, kids, and sporting equipment), and minimum off-road capabilities.\nThey wanted the ability to drive on dirt and gravel roads and the benefit of not be-\ning stuck in town (or at home) on heavy snow days.\nHaving successfully analyzed the market to maximize sales of the older version\nof the CR-V by carving out a unique identity in the Icelandic market and stressing\nthe extra urban connection with the target group, we now had to expand on our\nmarket research to find a new niche to match the newer version.\n*This chapter opening story was contributed by Ingvi Logason, Principal, H:N Advertising, Reykjavík, Iceland.\n545\n546 PART 5 • PRINCIPLES: IMC AND TOTAL COMMUNICATION\nOur research also showed that the Honda brand was seen as high quality, well\nbuilt, and reliable. Furthermore, the last campaign had managed to change the im-\nage from a car that was expensive and dull to one that was a great value (although\nnot inexpensive) and safe.\nWe needed a strategy that could build on the previous campaigns.\nWe set very ambitious objectives. In year 1 we intended to lower the average\nage of the new CR-V buyer from 47 years old to 45 years old. We aimed to increase\nstrong purchase intent for the Honda SUV for those under 40 years old to 30 per-\ncent (an increase of 20 percent), while maintaining the status quo among older buy-\ners. We also aimed to move the top-of-mind scores to fourth place among all car\nbrands (up two spots). This goal helped support the sales objective of increasing\nsales to a 12 percent market share in the small SUV segment. Historically, reaching\nthis goal would be enough to be make the CR-V the highest seller in the market.\nWe had good insight from our previous campaigns for the older generation\nCR-Vs. So we decided to simplify the message and exploit it further by taking the\ncampaign all urban. We would go all in on the prospect’s lifestyle and the car’s ur-\nban connection with the key phrase “Match CR-V . . . [to your lifestyle].”\nWe built a campaign positioning the CR-V as “an ultra inner-city SUV with\nspace and maneuverability for your daily activities.” At the same time, competitors\nwere promoting their small SUVs as sport SUVs or off-roaders.\nOur Big Idea was to challenge the target group to compare the new CR-V to\ntheir lifestyle. Their real usage was mostly for daily chores: grocery shopping, driv-\ning children to school, and so on, with a light mixture of rural activities.\nAll our headlines challenged the target group to match the car to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
