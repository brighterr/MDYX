When it was launched in the United Kingdom, sales of Dove Firming\nLotion reportedly increased by 700 percent in the first seven months after the posters appeared. It generated\na substantial press interest, with about 170 editorial pieces written in the first four months after the launch in\nGreat Britain.\nThe campaign radically changed the Dove brand image with its culturally relevant message. Initial pub-\nlicity generated more than 650 million media impressions in the United States, estimated to be worth more\nthan $21 million in free media exposure.\nMoreover, the definition of beauty portrayed in advertising really seems to be changing. When asked\nabout the images in Dove ads, 76 percent said women in the ad are beautiful, and 68 percent said, “It made\nyou think differently about the brand.”\nAdvertising Agenamed the Dove’s “Evolution” Web film as one of its best non-TV campaigns of the\ndecade. The viral film earned more than 6 million hits and lots of mentions in the national press on shows like\nGood Morning AmericaandThe View, which translates to about $150 million worth of media time.
