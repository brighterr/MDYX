Consumers perceived competitors like Nissan Sentra,\nHonda Civic, Scion, Toyota Corolla, and VW Rabbit or Jetta as being technologi-\ncally superior. Second, not only did Ford need to overcome the perception that\nforeign-made automobiles were more technologically advanced, it needed to\nmake the audience aware of its new innovation, which was practically invisible.\nAbout all Ford had to show potential buyers was a button on the steering wheel\nand a SYNC logo on the dashboard.\nBefore we get into a detailed analysis about how the advertising worked, let’s\nlook at Ford’s innovative technology. At the touch of a button or a simple voice\ncommand, drivers could use Ford’s SYNC technology, developed by Microsoft, to\nplay music from their digital music players and to make phone calls. What differ-\nentiates this technology from the competition is SYNC’s ability to understand var-\nious dialects of Spanish, which is particularly important to voice-activated\ncommands from a diverse U.S. Hispanic market. Ford knew that those who experi-\nenced this system in demos and focus groups gave it rave reviews.\nWanting to capitalize on the SYNC technology, Ford sought a campaign tar-\ngeting the 18- to 49-year-old Hispanic market that would accomplish two objec-\ntives: generate consumer awareness of SYNC by educating consumers, and get\nhand-raisers (those who indicate interest by responding online) to register for\nsweepstakes and to opt in for future Ford communications.\n97\n98 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\nFord hired Zubi, an Hispanic agency, to create a campaign. Zubi recognized\nthat Ford needed to get the attention of its audience before it could accomplish\nthe goals of making people aware of this great new technology and persuading\nthem that they ought to own it. Here’s how they did it.\nThe campaign’s Big Idea centered on the notion that Ford’s SYNC—the ability\nto control cell phones and MP3 players—was available at the driver’s command.\nAudience research showed that members of the Hispanic target market are tech-\nnologically savvy. They count on their MP3 players to help them during long com-\nmutes. To successfully introduce SYNC in fuel-efficient Fords, the campaign\nmessage needed to align the technology with consumers’ lifestyles in a fun way\nthat would grab their attention. The slogan, “SYNC: At Your Command” (SYNC: A\nTus Ordenes”), captured the heart of the message.\nZubiidentifiedaspokespersonforSYNCwhowouldbebelievable.Thatperson\nwasthepopularColombiansinger,songwriter,andmultipleGrammyaward-winner\nJuanes.AsamajorsponsorforJuanes’sWorldTour,Fordwasabletoreachmembers\noftheHispanictargetmarketandeducatethemaboutSYNC.Everyconcertfeatured\naSYNCZone,wherepeoplecouldseeSYNCdemonstrationsandparticipateingive-\naways.PotentialconsumerscouldvisitaSYNCJuanesdestinationwebsitehighlight-\ningvideocontent.TheycouldenteranonlinesweepstakeswithaJuanesVIPconcert\nexperienceasagrandprize.(Notetheopportunitytocapturethehand-raisers,build\nFord’sdatabase,andofferincentivesfortestdrives.)Thecampaignuseddisplayban-\nner ads, video banners, paid search (a fee given to get a sponsor’s website results\nshownnearthetopofsearchengineresultspages),awidgetsuchasaclockortem-\nperaturegauge,andpublisher-drivene-mailblastsonline.Magazineandnewspaper\nadvertising and radio spots helped publicize the concert and online activities.
