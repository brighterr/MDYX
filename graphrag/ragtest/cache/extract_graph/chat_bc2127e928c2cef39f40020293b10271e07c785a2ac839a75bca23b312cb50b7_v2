At the most basic level, however, media planners estimate the number of exposures attention to it.\ndelivered by a media mix.\n• ImpressionsAnimpressionis one person’s opportunity to be exposed one time to an ad in a\nspecific vehicle. Impressions can be added up as a measure of the size of the audience either\nfor one medium (one insertion in print) or for a combination of vehicles in a media mix.\n• CirculationImpressions are different from circulation,because impressions (at least in\nprint) estimate the readership or rather the opportunity to be exposed (delivery to the house-\nhold or a newsstand purchase), rather than just the circulation, which refers to copies sold.\n• Gross ImpressionsCirculation doesn’t tell you much about the actual exposure of a print ad.\nAmagazine may have a circulation of 1 million, but it might be read on average by 2.5 peo-\nple per issue. This means impressions for that issue would be 2.5 million. If the ad ran in\nthree consecutive issues, then the estimate of total impressions, called gross impressions,\nwould be 7.5 million. Similarly, the number of viewers watching a program might be greater\nthan the number of households reached since there may be more than one viewer watching\nand the commercial may be repeated several times in a program. Media planners add up all\nthose watching and multiply that times the number of placements to estimate gross impres-\nsions for TV.\n• RatingsGrossimpressionfiguresbecomeverylargeanddifficulttoworkwith,whichiswhy\nthetelevisionandradioindustriesuseratings(percentageofexposure),whichisaneasier\nmeasurementtoworkwithbecauseitconvertstherawfiguretoapercentageofhouseholds.\nWhenyoureadaboutatelevisionshowhavingaratingof20.0thatmeansthat20percent,\norone-fifthofallthehouseholdswithtelevisions,weretunedintothatprogram.Note:One\nratingpointequals1percentofthenation’sestimated1,114,000TVhomes;that’swhyplan-\nnersdescribethisprogramashaving20ratingpoints,orpercentagepoints.A20ratingisac-\ntuallyahugefigure,sincethefragmentationofcablehasdiversifiedtelevisionwatchingand\nmadeitverydifficulttoget20percentofthehouseholdstunedtoanyoneprogram.\n• ShareAbetter estimate of impressions might be found in a program’s share of audience,\nwhich refers to the percent of viewers based on the number of sets turned on. The share figure\nis always larger than the rating, since the base is smaller. For example, the 2010 Super Bowl\ngot a rating of 45 (45 percent of all households with television), but its share was 68, which\nmeans 68 percent of all televisions turned on were tuned to the Super Bowl.10\nReach and Frequency The goal of most media plans is to reach as many people in the target au-\nPrinciple\ndience as often as the budget allows.

Let’s revisit that case with more information about the campaign’s media\nplan, which demonstrates how different media are chosen based on consumer use and the ability\nof the various media to deliver either reach or frequency.\nYou may remember that focus groups were used by the H:N Marketing Communication\nagency in Reykjavik, Iceland to uncover key consumer insights about lamb—principally that con-\nsumers were not buying pricey prime lamb cuts and didn’t know how to cook the more budget-\npriced cuts.
