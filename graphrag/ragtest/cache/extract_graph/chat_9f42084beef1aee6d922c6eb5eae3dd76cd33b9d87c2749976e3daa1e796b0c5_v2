Some would argue that every brand contact is an experience; however, in experiential mar-\nketing the goal is to intensify active involvement beyond the more passive activity of reading,\nviewing, and listening to traditional media. The idea is to connect with consumers in ways that\ncreate higher levels of engagement, as well as lasting bonds with a brand.\nPackaging It’s not a new function, but packaging is receiving increased attention as a key\ncontact point. Apackage is both a container and a communication vehicle, and it works in the\nstore and in the home or office. In particular, it is the last ad a customer sees before making the\ndecision to buy a brand, as the Pepperidge Farm shelf photo illustrates. Although the focus of\nthis discussion is primarily on packaging for goods, don’t forget that services also are packaged\nin terms of such things as uniforms, other aspects of personal appearance, décor, and delivery\nvehicles.\nThe package is an important communication medium. Even if you can’t afford a big adver-\ntising budget, you’ve got a chance to grab shopper attention if your product has a compelling im-\nage on the shelf.” In an attempt to win over undecided consumers at the point of purchase, many\nmanufacturers create innovative, eye-catching packages. Although the industry has never devel-\noped a standard for measuring impressions from a shelf, advertisers are aware of the billboarding\neffect of a massed set of packages, a practice that Pepperidge Farm uses to good effect. Once on\nthe shelf at home or in the office, it is a constant brand reminder.\nWhen the package works in unison with other marketing communication, it not only catches\nattention and presents a familiar brand image, it can communicate critical information and tie\nCHAPTER 11 • MEDIA BASICS 339\nback to a current campaign. The package serves as a critical reminder of the product’s im-\nportant benefits at the moment the consumer is choosing among several competing brands.\nSometimes, the package itself is the focus of the advertising, particularly if there is a\nnew size or innovation, such as Coca-Cola’s introduction of a new bottle made from plant\nmaterials that is more compostable than plastic.12In sum, packaging is a constant commu-\nnicator, an effective device for carrying advertising messages, and a strong brand reminder.\nPackages can also deliver customer benefits. For example, recipes for Quaker Oats’\nfamous Oatmeal Cookies, Nestlé’s Tollhouse Cookies, Chex Party Mix, and Campbell’s\nGreen Bean Bake all started as promotional recipes on the product’s packaging and turned\ninto long-time favorites in homemakers’recipe boxes. There is even a website for these\nclassic recipes (www.backofthebox.com) that features more than 1,500 recipes found on\npackaging.\nAnotheruseofpackagingisfoundonmilkcartonswherecause-marketingcampaigns,\naswellasothercross-promotions,haveappeared.Missingchildrenhavebeenfeaturedsince\nthe1980s,butmorerecentlyadsonthehalf-pintsgiventoschoolchildrenactastinybill-\nboardspromotingchildren’sproductssuchaskidsmovies.Largermilkcartonssoldinstores\npromotelocalbrandsandsportsteams,cereals,cookies,HoneyMaidgrahamcrackers,and\nDuncanHinesbrownies.13\nPackagingoffersawaytodealwithanethicalissuethatbedevilssomemarketers—\nproductingredientandhealtheffectslabeling.Anumberofcategories,suchashousehold\ncleaners,havebeenchallengedbyconsumersaboutthechemicalsintheirproducts.Steve\nIsrael,aNewYorklegislator,believestheproblemcanbeaddressedwithmandatorylabel-\ning legislation.Tobacco companies are also being targeted, particularly in Europe where\ntheyarerequiredtousealargepartofthepackageforwarninglabels.Legislationhaspro-\nposedthatwarninglabelscoverthetophalfofthefrontandbackofcigarettepacksandin-\ncludefrighteningimages,suchasdiseasedlungs.14\nWord of Mouth Buzz is important because it means people are talking about a brand. This\nbuzz may be the most important factor in consumer decision making because the recom-\nmendations of others are highly persuasive—more so than any advertisement. Given the en-\ngaging work of its agency, Crispin Porter (cid:2)Bogusky, Burger King is often lauded as the\n“king of buzz.” Tia Lang, interactive director at BK, says “Social media is very important\nin today’s environment and we think generating buzz is a positive result in and of itself.”\nThe SAS business analytics\nsoftware company connects\nits products and services to\nthe potential reader by\nstaying in touch with\ncustomer experiences and\nneeds.\nPrinciple\nA package is the last ad a\nPepperidge Farm, with its consistent design and distinctive customer sees before\nbrand image, dominates cookie shelves because of the power making a decision on\nof its consistent design across all the brand’s variations. which brand to buy.\n340 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nShe explained that “We have done some innovative campaigns that have helped lead to 20 con-\nPrinciple\nsecutive quarters of positive sales.”15\nThe goal of buzz-builder\nstrategies is to get the Astudy of media use by the BIGresearch firm that polled 15,000 consumers found that the\nright people saying the most influential form of media is word of mouth.16The goal is to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
