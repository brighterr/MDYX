Anchor AssociationsTo distinguish undifferentiated products with low inherent interest, ad-\nvertisers often link the product with visual associations representing lifestyles and types of\nusers, as the “Nice Altoids” ad demonstrates.\nVisual Impact\nIn most marketing communication, the power to get attention primarily lies with the visual. The\nexcitement and drama in a television commercial is created through moving images. But it is an\nPrinciple\nintriguing idea that grabs attention and remains in memory.

The billboard raised a furor in Italy because attention.\n292 PART 3 • PRACTICE: WHERE IS CREATIVE HEADED?\nit showed shocking pictures of a naked anorexic woman. The image was shot by\nOliviero Toscani, the former photographer/art director for Benetton, who stirred\nup emotions over his photos for that clothing brand by depicting a dying AIDS\nvictim, death-row inmates, and a nun and priest kissing. Professor Edoardo\nBrioschi explains the issues with these images of anorexia in the A Principled\nPracticefeature.\nIn general, print designers have found that a picture in a print ad captures\nmore than twice as many readers as a headline does. Furthermore, the bigger the\nillustration, the more the message grabs consumers’attention. Ads with pictures\nalso tend to pull more readers into the body copy; initial attention is more likely\nto turn to interest with a strong visual. People not only notice ad visuals, they re-\nmember ads with pictures more than those composed mostly of type. Both the be-\nlievability factor and the interest-building impact of a visual story are reasons why\nvisuals are anchored so well in memory.\nBig Ideas that capture attention can be puzzling, shocking, or funny. An ex-\nample is found in the “Welcome” doormat poster used with a twist by Columbia\nSportswear. AVonage campaign for its Web-based phone service uses videos of peo-\nple doing silly things to illustrate its message: “That people do really stupid things.\nLike pay too much for home phone service.” The commercials show a man cutting\nIBM used a chick and down a tree that falls on his car and a man on a treadmill who loses his footing and falls off.

As he looks out the window, he sees a\ngroup of birds sitting on a set of five power and telephone wires that are conveniently aligned to\nlook like a music staff. From the bird’s positions he crafts a tune that becomes the theme for his\ncomposition. PBS used these clever little visual stories to present itself as a creative force that in-\nspires people to use their imaginations.\nThe point is that creative people and art directors in particular design images that tell stories\nand create brand impressions. The art—the image or visual elements—in a marketing communi-\ncation message can touch emotional buttons. Research by professor Karen Mallia, a regular con-\ntributor who wrote an essay for our Part 3 opener, suggests that not only are images moving, they\nalso are becoming increasingly dramatic and controversial. She has studied the use of religious\nimagery in marketing communication and observes that “the change in tenor is best illustrated\nwith the use of priests in advertising.”\nIn 1975, Xerox’s “Brother Dominick” spot starred a sweet, earnest monk invoking a “mir-\nacle” in duplicating 500 illuminated manuscripts. Fast-forward to 1991, when Benetton\nshocked the world with a priest and nun kissing. In 2005, Stella Artois’“Skating Priests”\naward-winning spot used surreal, almost sinister humor as you realize that a group of priests\nwould rather see their fellow priest drown than lose a beer. In 2006, Pirelli tire launched a\nworldwide campaign with “The Call,” a 20-minute Web film starring John Malkovich as a\npriest called upon to exorcise a car, and Naomi Campbell as the devil.\nMallia concludes that “The Call” with its dramatic tone brings a new level of darkness to ad-\nvertising featuring\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
