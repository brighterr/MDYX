The term psychographics refers to lifestyle and psychological characteristics, such as ac-\ntivities, values, interests, attitudes, and opinions.\nSometimes these complex psychographic factors are more relevant in explaining consumer\nPrinciple\nbehavior than are demographics. For example, two families living next door to each other with Often differences in\nthe same general income, education, and occupational profiles may have radically different buy- consumer behavior lie in\ning patterns. One family may be obsessed with recycling, while their neighbors rarely bother to psychographics—\neven keep their newspapers separate from their trash. One family is into hiking and other outdoor consumers’ interests and\nsports; the other watches sports on television. One is saving money for a European vacation; the lifestyles—rather than in\nother is seriously in debt and can barely cover the monthly bills. The differences lie not in their demographics.\ndemographics, but in their psychographics—their interests and lifestyles.\nAdvertisers use psychographics to depict fairly complex consumer patterns. Libraries of\npsychographic measures can be purchased from research firms, or a company and its advertising\nagency can create its own set of psychographic measures to fit its particular product. These psy-\nchographic measures can then be used to describe customers (such as heavy users of gourmet cof-\nfee), their response to advertising message strategies (taste comparison ads), or their media\nchoices (heavy users of the Internet).\nAttitudes Anattitudeis a predisposition that reflects an opinion, emotion, or mental state di- Principle\nrected at some object, person, or idea. Advertisers are interested in attitudes because of their im- Strategies that are\npact on motivations. Because attitudes are learned, we can establish them, change them, reinforce designed to affect\nthem, or replace them with new ones. However, most attitudes are deeply set, reflect basic val- attitudes focus on\nues, and tend to be resistant to change—you can hold an attitude for years or even decades. Atti- establishing, changing,\ntudes also vary in direction and strength; that is, an attitude can be positive or negative, reflecting reinforcing, or replacing\nlike or dislike, or it can be neutral. Attitudes are important to advertisers because they influence them.\nhow consumers evaluate products, institutions, retail stores, and advertising.\nOne trend that depicts changing attitudes is what Time magazine editor Richard Stengel\ncalled “ethical consumerism,” which refers to consumers who buy according to their conscience,\nwhether it be a concern for supporting local businesses and ecology and energy efficiency or boy-\ncotting wasteful packaging and sweatshops. The Timepoll found that 82 percent said they shop\nlocal and 40 percent said they purchased a product “because they liked the social or political val-\nues of the company that produced it.” At the same time, many companies have found that social\nresponsibility attracts investments, as well as customer loyalty. Stengel explains, “With global\nwarming on the minds of many consumers, lots of companies are racing to ‘outgreen’one an-\nother.” This results in business practices that build a positive “triple bottom line”: profit, planet,\nand people.31\nLifestyles Psychographic analysis looks at lifestyles in terms of patterns of consumption, per-\nsonal relationships, interests, and leisure activities. The DDB advertising agency has been con-\nducting lifestyle research annually in the United States since 1975. The agency surveys 5,000 men\nand women on nearly 1,000 questions pertaining to such diverse topics as health, financial out-\nlook, raising kids, shopping, religion, hobbies, leisure activities, household chores, politics, even\ntheir desired self-image. The survey also asks people about the products they use (from soup\nto nuts!) and their media habits. This wealth of information makes it possible to paint a vivid,\n146 PART 2 • PRINCIPLE: BE TRUE TO THY BRAND\ndetailed, multidimensional portrait of nearly any consumer segment\nthat might be of interest to a client—and it also lets the agency spot\nchanges and trends in people’s lifestyles over time.\nFormer DDB strategy director Marty Horn says that “DDB be-\nlieves that advertising—and all other forms of marketing commu-\nPerson Product\nnication—is really a personal conversation between the brand being\nadvertised and the consumer, and the better we know the consumer\nwith whom we are conversing, the more engaging and persuasive\nLifestyle\nour message will be.” The agency’s Life Style Survey is an impor-\ntant source of information that lets this conversation happen. Horn\nexplains, “The DDB Life Style Survey helps us get a more ‘up close\nand personal’look at who our clients’customers are than what con-\nventional research alone can provide.”\nSSeettttiinngg HorndescribesanexampleoftheuseoftheLifeStyleSurvey\ndatatosegmentanaudiencefortheBloodCenterofWisconsinwhen\nthecenterfounditselflowondonations.TheDDBresearchteamwas\nabletodescribefrequentdonorsassociable,dotingparents,hardwork-\ning,informationseekers,andcommunityleaders.Thecommunication\nstrategywasrefinedtoappealtoamoreprofessionalworkingpeople\nFIGURE 5.4\naudienceandthecentersawaturnaroundinitslevelofdonations.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
