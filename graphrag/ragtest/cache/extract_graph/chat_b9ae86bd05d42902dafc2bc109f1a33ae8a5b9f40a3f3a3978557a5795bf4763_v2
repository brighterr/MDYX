Kiosks are typically located in places where people walk, such as a many-sided structure\nin a mall or near a public walkway, or where people wait. The location has a lot to do with the de-\nsign of the message. Some out-of-home media serve the same function as the kiosk, such as the\nad-carrying bus shelter. The series of posters for Dallas-based Texins Activity Center were con-\ntributed by Michael Dattolico.\nTransit Advertising\nTransit advertising is mainly an urban mass advertising form that places ads on vehicles such as\nbuses and taxis that circulate through the community as moving billboards. Some of these use\nstriking graphics, such as the designs on the sides of the Mayflower moving trucks. Transit ad-\nvertising also includes the posters seen in bus shelters and train, airport, and subway stations.\nMost of these posters must be designed for quick impressions, although people who are waiting\non subway platforms or bus shelters often study these posters, so here they can present a more in-\nvolved or complicated message than a billboard can.\nTherearetwotypesoftransitadvertising:interiorandexterior.Interior transit advertising\nis seen by people riding inside buses, subway cars, and taxis.

It started in 1993, when PepsiCo paid\nSeattle in return for permission to wrap six city buses with its logo. More recently recession-\nweary drivers have been tempted to sign up to have their cars and trucks wrapped with ads for\nbrands such as Jamba Juice and Verizon in exchange for monthly payments.\n368 PART 4 • PRACTICE: WHERE ARE MEDIA HEADED?\nSHOWCASE\nThese posters for Texins Activity Center were all designed to get the attention of kids and their parents and\nentice them to enroll in a Spring Break Kids’ Camp. The common theme was to “take a break from\nthe digital world” and try such outside activities as photography and tennis.\nMichael Dattolico, owner of Musion Creative, is a graduate of the University of\nFlorida. He was nominated by Professor Elaine Wagner.\nUsing Print and Out-of-Home Media Effectively\nThis review of print and out-of-home advertising should be helpful in explaining when and why\nvarious types of media are included in a media mix. To summarize these key decisions, consider\nusing newspaper advertising for messages that include an announcement of something new.\nNewspapers are also good for targeting local markets. Magazines are great for targeting people\nwith special interests. They also have great production values and are good for messages that ei-\nther focus on brand image or need space for a more complete explanation.\nOutdoor advertising targets audiences on the move and provides directional information.\nOutdoor messages are also good for brand reminders. Directory ads catch people when they\nare shopping. The following table summarizes the advantages and limitations of these various\nmedia:\nPrint and Out-of-Home Media Advantages and Limitations\nAdvantages Limitations\nNewspapers Good for news announcements Short life span\nGood market coverage Clutter\nGood for comparison shopping Limited reach for certain groups\nPositive consumer attitudes Poor production values\nGood for reaching educated\nand affluent consumers\nFlexibility—geographic; scheduling\nCHAPTER 12 • TRADITIONAL MEDIA 369\nAdvantages Limitations\nMagazines High production values Long lead times—limited flexibility\nTargets consumers’interests— Lack of immediacy\nspecialized audiences High cost\nReceptive audience Sometimes limited distribution\nLong life span\nFormat encourages creativity\nGood for brand messages\nGood for complex or in-depth\nmessages\nDirectories Directional: Consumers go to Lack of flexibility—can be a long\ndirectories for shopping time before a change can be made\ninformation Competitive clutter and look-alike ads\nTrusted Low production quality\nInexpensive\nGood ROI of 1:15—every dollar\nspent on an ad produces $145\nin revenue\nFlexible in size, colors, formats\nLong life\nOut-of-Home Good situational medium Traffic moves quickly\nMedia Directional Can’t handle complex messages—\nBrand reminder medium designs must be simple\nHigh-impact—larger than life May be easy to miss (depending\nLeast expensive on location)\nLong life Some criticize outdoor ads as\n“polluting” the landscape\nTransit lacks the size advantage\nof other outdoor media\nWHAT ARE BROADCAST MEDIA CHARACTERISTICS?\nWhenwespeakofbroadcastmedia,wearediscussingmediaformsthattransmitsoundsorim-\nageselectronically.Theseincluderadio,televisionandothervideoforms,andmovieadvertising.\n(TheInternetandotherdigitalnewmediawillbediscussedinthenextchapter.)Printisastatic\nmediumboughtbyamountofspace(columninches)andcirculation;incontrast,broadcastmedia\naredynamicandboughtbyamountoftime(seconds,minutes)andtheiraudiencesize.Broadcast\nmediamessagesarefleeting,whichmeanstheymayaffecttheviewer’semotionsforafewsec-\nondsandthendisappear,incontrasttoprintmessages,whichcanberevisitedandreread.\nWhat that means, in terms of our Facets of Effects Model, is that broadcast is more enter-\ntaining\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
